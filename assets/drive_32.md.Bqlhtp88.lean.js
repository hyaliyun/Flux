To increase their children 's chances of survival , Chan 's birth parents gave away some of their youngest to other families . As a result , Chan was adopted by Chan Fei - nung and his wife , Kung Fan - hung , who were renowned Cantonese opera stars . During the 1960s , Connie Chan was one of Hong Kong cinema 's most beloved teen idols . She made more than 230 films in a variety of genres : from traditional Cantonese opera and wuxia movies to contemporary youth musicals ; action films to comedies ; melodramas and romances . Owing to her popularity she was dubbed \`\` The Movie - Fan Princess '' . Her godfather is actor Cho Tat Wah . She has a son named Dexter Yeung , who stars in the 2008 TVB Series Wasabi Mon Amour and Moonlight Resonance . - Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries. - Henan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country. Its one-character abbreviation is \\"\\" (yù), named after Yuzhou, a Han Dynasty state (\\"zhou\\") that included parts of Henan. Although the name of the province means \\"south of the river\\", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River, also known as the \\"Huang He\\". - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory. - The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Karimata and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan of around . The area's importance largely results from one-third of the world's shipping sailing through its waters and that it is believed to hold huge oil and gas reserves beneath its seabed. - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world. - The Cantonese opera is one of the major categories in Chinese opera, originating in southern China's Guangdong Province. It is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and among the Chinese community in Southeast Asia. Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. History. There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south. - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. - Chinese opera is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty. Early forms of Chinese drama are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become Chinese opera. - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub. - Hangzhou, formerly romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in east China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium, due in part to its beautiful natural scenery. The city's West Lake is its best-known attraction. - Sichuan, formerly romanized as Szechwan, is a province in southwest China occupying most of the Sichuan Basin between the Himalayas on the west, the Daba in the north, and the Yungui Plateau to the east. Sichuan's capital is Chengdu. - Cantonese, or Standard Cantonese, is a variant of Yue Chinese spoken in the vicinity of Guangzhou (known historically as Canton) in southeastern China. It is the traditional prestige dialect of Yue. - , formerly romanized as Chekiang, is an eastern coastal province of China. Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu province and Shanghai municipality to the north, Anhui province to the northwest, Jiangxi province to the west, and Fujian province to the south; to the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. - Acrobatics (from Greek \\"akrobate\\", \\"walk on tiptoe, strut\\") is the performance of extraordinary feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination. It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities such as ballet and diving may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics. - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population. The provincial capital Guangzhou and economic hub Shenzhen are among the most populous and important cities in China. The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people.

Q: CONTEXT: Construcción Los templos se erigieron a lo largo de todo el Alto y el Bajo Egipto, así como en los oasis del desierto de Libia bajo control egipcio, hasta Siwa, y en puestos avanzados como Timna, en la península del Sinaí. En los períodos en que Egipto controló Nubia los gobernantes del Nilo construyeron templos allí, tan al sur como Gebel Barkal. La mayoría de ciudades de Egipto tenían un templo, pero en algunos casos, como los templos funerarios o los templos de Nubia, se creaban de nueva planta en tierras antes deshabitadas. El emplazamiento exacto del templo era decidido por motivos religiosos, y podría ser el lugar de nacimiento o enterramiento mítico de un dios. La orientación del templo podía decidirse para alinearlo con lugares de significado religioso, como un templo vecino, el nacimiento del sol o la posición de alguna estrella. Por ejemplo, el gran templo de Abu Simbel, está alineado de tal manera que dos veces al año los rayos del sol naciente iluminan las estatuas de los dioses en el sancta sanctorum.

Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilites radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music . Elements of experimental music include indeterminate music, in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may also approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incoprorate unorthodox and unique elements . The practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. John Cage was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing indeterminacy techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, Pierre Schaeffer had begun using the term \\"\\"\\"\\" to describe compositional activities that incorporated tape music, musique concrète, and elektronische Musik. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe computer-controlled composition associated with composers such as Lejaren Hiller. Harry Partch as well as Ivor Darreg worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of experimental musical instruments. Musique concrète (French; literally, \\"concrete music\\"), is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises acousmatic sound as a compositional resource. Free improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid \\"clichés\\", i.e., overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What is the topic of this article? 2. When did this become prominent ? 3. On what continents was it generally found? 4. Who was one of the first people to use the term? 5. What \\"instrument\\" did Lejaren Hiller use in his works? 6. Did Harry Partch and Ivor Darreg use traditional instruments? 7.

The law also created a system for evaluating teachers and principals based in part on the performance of their students. It specified that student performance metrics must be based on objective measures, including their performance on standardized tests. Walker approved a two-year freeze of tuition at the University of Wisconsin System in the 2013 budget. In 2014, he proposed a two-year extension of the freeze based on expected cash balances for the system in excess of 1 billion. On February 3, 2015, Walker delivered a budget proposal to the Wisconsin Legislature, in which he recommended placing the University of Wisconsin system under the direction of a \\"private authority\\", governed by the Board of Regents (all the governor's appointees).

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built.

This Treaty was signed by six founding member countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The signing took place on March 25, 1957, and the EEC was created to foster economic cooperation and integration among these European nations. The Treaty of Rome was a significant step towards European unity, following the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) by the Treaty of Paris in 1951. The EEC aimed to facilitate trade, promote economic growth, and improve the standard of living among the member nations through the creation of a single market with the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. The Treaty of Rome contained provisions on a variety of economic and social policies, such as: 1. Establishing a customs union, which eliminated tariffs and trade barriers among member countries and established a common external tariff for imports from third countries. 2. Harmonizing member countries' economic policies, including coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. 3. Introducing the principle of free movement of people, which enabled citizens of member countries to live and work in any other member country without restrictions. 4. Promoting common agricultural and transport policies to coordinate and support the development of these sectors. 5. Providing for the establishment of the European Investment Bank to help fund infrastructure and development projects in the member countries. 6. Encouraging cooperation in scientific research and technological advancements. 7. Establishing cooperation in social and employment policies, such as workers' rights, minimum wage, and workplace safety regulations. The Treaty of Rome marked an important milestone in European history and has undergone several amendments and expansions over the years. It laid the foundation for the development of the European Union (EU), which has been shaped by subsequent treaties like the Maastricht Treaty (1992), the Amsterdam Treaty (1997), the Nice Treaty (2001), and the Lisbon Treaty (2007). These treaties have expanded the scope of European integration by adding new areas of cooperation, introducing new institutions, and increasing membership to the current 27 countries in the EU."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living.

However, considering the context of the phrase, we can make some educated guesses. Firstly, let's break down the meaning of the phrase. \\"Run-of-the-mill\\" suggests something ordinary, average, or lacking in uniqueness. \\"Profanity\\" usually refers to offensive language or swearing. Thus, when combined, the phrase seems to describe a movie containing typical cursing or foul language that is no different than what one might find in other movies. Based on this interpretation, the review appears to have a negative or at least neutral connotation about the movie. The critic could be implying that the film relies on profanity without adding anything original or outstanding, which might lead to a less engaging viewer experience. The presence of unoriginal profanity could indicate that the movie does not provide fresh or innovative content, which, in turn, might affect the perception of the movie negatively. However, it is essential to consider that humor, personal taste, and preferences may significantly influence the interpretation of the phrase. For some, the description of \\"run-of-the-mill profanity\\" may not necessarily be negative, as it may refer to a movie that is in line with their expectations or preferences for a specific genre. Ultimately, without more context, it is challenging to decisively answer the question as positive or negative. Nonetheless, considering the analysis presented, it is more likely that the review leans towards a negative opinion of the movie due to the usage of phrases that describe unoriginal and ordinary content."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Amber: Sophia: O wow!!

It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout in the history of the American Wild West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud, with Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury on one side and town Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Policeman Morgan Earp, Special Policeman Wyatt Earp, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys, who objected to the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton claimed that he was unarmed and ran from the fight, along with Billy Claiborne. Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories.

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it. Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter. An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material breach. What is the answer to this question: Does a material breach necessarily suspend or terminate treaty relations?","output":"A material breach does not necessarily suspend or terminate treaty relations. Whether a treaty is suspended or terminated due to a material breach depends on several factors, including how the other parties involved in the treaty perceive the breach and the mechanism for resolving disputes within the treaty itself. A material breach refers to a situation when one of the parties involved in a treaty fails to meet its obligations under the terms of the treaty, effectively going against the spirit and purpose of the agreement. The occurrence of a material breach can be detrimental to the functioning and stability of the treaty, but it does not directly lead to the suspension or termination of treaty relations. The response to a material breach varies depending on the specific circumstances surrounding the breach and the nature of the treaty. Some treaties include provisions that define the seriousness of a breach and outline the appropriate course of action in the event of a material breach. In certain cases, a treaty may contain clauses that allow for the suspension or termination of treaty relations when a material breach occurs, while other treaties may require further negotiations, mediation, or arbitration to address the issue. Moreover, some treaties may provide for the involvement of a third-party tribunal or an independent arbiter to assess the breach's seriousness and determine the appropriate response. This approach has the advantage of preventing a party from unilaterally and prematurely suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another party's alleged material breach. By involving an impartial decision-maker, all parties can be assured that any decision on the continuation or termination of treaty relations is based on a fair and unbiased evaluation of the circumstances. In conclusion, a material breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations. The decision to suspend or terminate a treaty following a material breach depends on the treaty's provisions, the other parties' views, and the mechanism used to address disputes and breaches. In some cases, an independent arbiter or tribunal may determine the seriousness of the breach and provide a course of action to minimize potential conflicts, ensuring that any decisions made are fair and impartial."},{"instruction":"Question: What does Quorra witness as she and Sam depart?

Answer: Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"To answer the question \\"How simple is the process of transformation?\\" comprehensively, it's important to consider the context of transformation. As it is not clear which type of transformation you are referring to, I will provide a step-by-step explanation for two different processes: genetic transformation in bacteria and geometric transformation. 1. Genetic transformation in bacteria: - Isolation of DNA from a donor organism. - Uptake of the donor DNA by the recipient bacteria. - Integration of the donor DNA into the bacterial chromosome or plasmid. - Expression of the donor DNA in the recipient bacterium. Considering these steps, the process of genetic transformation is not simple, as it involves multiple coordinated cellular processes and requires various bacterial gene products. 2. Geometric transformation: - Identify the type of transformation (translation, rotation, reflection, or dilation). - Determine the necessary parameters for the transformation (distance, angle, line of reflection, or scale factor). - Apply the rules of the transformation to the initial geometric shape. - Obtain the transformed geometric shape. Considering these steps, geometric transformation process can either be simple or complex depending on the level of mathematical understanding.

In a recent New Yorker article examining just how thorough \\"Silicon Valley\\" creators and writers are about building their fake world, writer Andrew Marantz offered a revealing detail from the show's head consultant, Jonathan Dotan. Dotan was remarking on an idea Judge and Berg floated to him one day in the writers' room.

After graduation, he moved to Chicago and took classes at the Second City Theatre. Unlike some of his peers there—Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Adam McKay—Costolo was not asked to join the theatre’s house company, and his comedy career dried up. He fell back on his skills as a coder and founded a series of tech startups, one of which was eventually acquired by Google, for a hundred million dollars. In 2010, he became the C.E.O. of Twitter, earning about ten million dollars in his first year. At a charity event, he ran into Steve Carell, and they reminisced about their days as bohemian improvisers. “I’m sorry it didn’t work out for you,” Carell joked. In June of 2015, with Twitter’s stock price languishing, Costolo announced that he would leave the company. (According to the tech press, the board of directors had forced him out; Costolo maintains that leaving was his idea.) Three days later, HBO aired the second-season finale of its half-hour satire “Silicon Valley.” The season ended on a cliffhanger: the central character, the founder and C.E.O. of a tech company, was fired by his board. Costolo, a fan of the show, found the situation uncannily familiar. “I could relate to every person in that situation—the founder who’s leaving, the C.E.O. who’s coming in, the employees who are watching it happen,” he said. Around that time, Costolo had breakfast in San Francisco with Kara Swisher, a tech reporter and power broker who has been called “Silicon Valley’s most feared and well-liked journalist.” Conversation turned to “Silicon Valley,” the show. “People in the Valley—at least, the people I know—talk about the show all the time,” Costolo told me. “Most of them love it, oddly. I think there are a lot of people telling themselves, with varying levels of accuracy, ‘They’re satirizing those annoying tech people—not me.’” Swisher, who knows everyone, was in frequent contact with the showrunners, Mike Judge and Alec Berg. “I’ll introduce you,” she told Costolo. The next month, Costolo had lunch with Judge and Berg in Los Angeles. They told him that they had written themselves into a corner. Their show was about an entrepreneur striving to build a company; having separated the entrepreneur from the company, they weren’t sure how to proceed. For a show that devotes a good amount of time to slapstick and gross-out sight gags, “Silicon Valley” is deceptively well-researched, and Judge and Berg had decided that the best way out of their bind was to hire a consultant who could give them more information. To their surprise, Costolo expressed interest. “We just need someone who knows how these companies work, not someone who actually ran one of them,” Berg said. Despite being overqualified, Costolo got the job. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of Twitter, was one of more than two hundred consultants on the show. *Photograph by Scott Olson / Getty * Photograph by Scott Olson / Getty “Silicon Valley” is mostly filmed on multiple sets, inside a concrete Sony lot in Los Angeles—not in Silicon Valley, but in the same time zone. Every Monday morning for three and a half months, Costolo flew from San Francisco to L.A., took an Uber to Culver City, dropped his overnight bag at a nearby hotel, and spent Monday and Tuesday in the writer’s room. Berg, Judge, and ten writers peppered him with questions, both narrow and existential. Where would the most powerful person in a boardroom sit? What would motivate an entrepreneur like Richard, and what would he find most demoralizing? “I would tell them a detail about something I’d observed or someone I’d met, and they would get this sparkle in their eye and go, ‘That really happens?’” Costolo said. Over time, Costolo grew comfortable enough to pitch jokes of his own. “They were generous about letting me down gently,” he told me. “It was interesting to go from the C.E.O. to the least experienced guy in the room.” Among the tech-journalism books that everyone on staff had read was “Hatching Twitter,” Nick Bilton’s history of the company. “Once, they were debating what should happen next in a story arc,” Costolo told me. “Mike asked the room, ‘Didn’t they face a problem like this in the Twitter book? What did they decide?’ Someone had to point out, ‘Mike, one of the people from that book is in the room. Let’s just ask him what happened.’” “Silicon Valley,” now in its third season, is one of the funniest shows on television; it is also the first ambitious satire of any form to shed much light on the current socio-cultural moment in Northern California. The show derives its energy from two semi-contradictory attitudes: contempt for grandiose tech oligarchs and sympathy for the entrepreneurs struggling to unseat them. In the pilot episode, Richard Hendricks, a shy but brilliant engineer, designs a compression algorithm—an ingenious way to make big files smaller. He later turns this innovation into a company, which he insists on calling Pied Piper. (Richard: “It’s a classic fairy tale.” Employee: “It’s about a predatory flautist who murders children in a cave.”) As his company grows, Richard becomes a nerd David beset by Goliaths: duplicitous board members, corporations trying to steal his intellectual property. Can he succeed without compromising his values? The deep irony of Richard’s situation—that his ultimate goal, presumably, is to become a Goliath himself—either has not yet come up in the writer’s room or is being tabled for later. Richard Hendricks, played by Thomas Middleditch, is a genius coder who struggles to make an algorithm into a business. Photograph by John P. Fleenor / HBO Photograph by John P. Fleenor / HBO “Real startups go through all the shit you see on the show, as well as even crazier shit,” Roger McNamee, a venerable venture capitalist and a consultant to the show, told me. “If anything, the writers might have to leave out true things in order to seem more realistic.” Both Judge and Berg have an eye for authenticity. In Judge’s movie “Office Space,” from 1999, he enlivened his subject—white-collar drudgery—with details he had experienced or observed: a boss’s onerous attention to the formatting of T.P.S. reports, a chain restaurant that forces its servers to wear at least fifteen pieces of “flair.” Similarly, many of the shows that Berg has written for, notably “Seinfeld,” harvested story lines from real life. “On ‘Seinfeld,’ the same thing happened again and again,” Berg told me. “Someone would pitch ten ideas. The first nine would be wacky, silly things, and the tenth would be genuinely funny and interesting. You’d go, ‘That tenth thing—where’d that one come from?’ and the person would say, ‘That one actually happened to a friend of mine.’” When you’re writing a show about nothing, or a movie about cubicle culture, it’s easy to collect realistic details. But if you want to know how a non-compete clause would be structured, or what kind of car a typical brogrammer would drive, or whether Richard’s firing would trigger an afternoon of malaise or a personal crisis, then you need to do your homework. TV writers have long consulted experts—a doctor to demonstrate how to hold a defibrillator, a military officer to make sure the uniforms are the right color. In the past, these consultants were often akin to fact-checkers, brought in near the end of the writing process to make sure that nothing looked glaringly wrong. These days, TV is taken more seriously, and everyone’s a critic with access to Twitter and Wikipedia. “You can’t fool audiences with unrealistic schlock anymore,” Jay Carson told me. Carson was the press secretary for Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign in 2008; he then served as the Chief Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles. In 2011, his friend Beau Willimon hired him as a political consultant on “House of Cards.” “I helped us pass a smell test, both with D.C. insiders and the general audience,” he said. “Even during the five years I was there, the audience got more sophisticated every season.” “Silicon Valley” is a reported sitcom. “We do plenty of silly jokes, but we also go to great lengths to make the world feel real,” Berg told me. “The hope is that someone in the Valley”—a scrawny coder, a billionaire, or someone who fits both descriptions—“will be able to watch it and go, ‘I might not like that they’re taking shots at us, but at least it’s grounded in truth.’” Richard has now been reinstated as the C.E.O., and, after several episodes devoted to lawsuits and succession crises, Pied Piper has returned to the simple joy of building its platform. “In the writer’s room, I talked a lot about how the founder of a company has a moral authority that no other C.E.O., no matter how accomplished, will ever have,” Costolo told me. The showrunner and writer Alec Berg and the actor T. J. Miller on set. “By satirizing them, you’re holding up a mirror,” Miller says. Photograph by Frank Masi / HBO Photograph by Frank Masi / HBO The show’s signature gag, from the first season, was a minute-long montage of startup founders pledging to “make the world a better place through Paxos algorithms for consensus protocols,” or to “make the world a better place through canonical data models to communicate between endpoints.” This scene was set at TechCrunch Disrupt, a real event where founders take turns pitching their ideas, “American Idol”-style, to an auditorium full of investors. Before writing the episode, Judge and Berg spent a weekend at TechCrunch Disrupt, in San Francisco. “That’s the first thing you notice,” Judge said. “It’s capitalism shrouded in the fake hippie rhetoric of ‘We’re making the world a better place,’ because it’s uncool to just say ‘Hey, we’re crushing it and making money.’” After the scene aired, viewers complained about the lack of diversity in the audience. Berg recalled, “A friend of mine who works in tech called me and said, ‘Why aren’t there any women? That’s bullshit!’ I said to her, ‘It is bullshit! Unfortunately, we shot that audience footage at the actual TechCrunch Disrupt.’” Berg and Judge have backgrounds that enable them to understand Silicon Valley culture better than most laypeople, and they tend to hire writers who are similarly equipped. In the late eighties, before the first tech bubble, Judge worked as an electrical engineer in Santa Clara, designing graphics cards. Berg’s father is a biophysicist at Harvard; Berg told me that his brother, a coder and entrepreneur, “went to grad school for computer science at Stanford, a few doors down from Sergey and Larry”—Brin and Page, whose graduate work turned into Google. Dan Lyons, a writer on the third season of the show, was a tech reporter who left journalism to work for a startup, then got fired and wrote a memoir, “Disrupted,” about the experience. Another “Silicon Valley” writer, Carrie Kemper, graduated from Stanford in 2006 and worked in Google’s H.R. department. At Google, Kemper noticed that her boss’s morning routine included Googling himself. That joke made its way into a recent episode. (“I started my day, as I always do, by typing my own name into Hooli search. I enjoy the ritual, which is designed to center me,” the C.E.O. of Hooli, a Google-like company, says. “Lately, it’s been doing the opposite.”) Mike Judge, known for enlivening his comedies with authentic details, filming on location. Photograph by Frank Masi / HBO Photograph by Frank Masi / HBO When I was on the Sony lot where the current season of “Silicon Valley” was being filmed, several people encouraged me to talk to Jonathan Dotan, an entrepreneur who is now the show’s lead technical consultant. “He’s the one who looks like a con man in Havana in 1947,” Dan O’Keefe, a writer and producer, told me. This turned out to mean that, in contradistinction to the writers, crew members, and actors, who tend to wear jeans and sneakers both on and off camera, Dotan favors tailored blazers, pocket squares, and colorful dress socks. I waited for him in the offices of Raviga, the show’s fictional venture-capital firm. The décor—exposed brick, burnished steel, geographically ambiguous throw rugs—felt eerily similar to actual V.C. offices I have visited, the way a Hyatt in Toronto might exhibit an aesthetic entanglement with a Hyatt in the Houston airport. To give the show’s directors the freedom to point the camera wherever they like, the set designers built a whole floor of office space and covered it with realistic touches, from the plaques on the walls to the issues of MIT Technology Review fanned out on a waiting-room table. Compounding the paramnesiac effect was the fact that many of the rooms actually were being used as offices—production staffers who weren’t needed elsewhere sat behind closed glass doors, typing or making phone calls. Dotan led me to Raviga’s boardroom. He tried two fake outlets before finding a real one, then plugged in his laptop, opened it on a blond-wood conference table, and launched a PowerPoint presentation he had prepared about the show’s research process. “The first part of the job is making sure we get the specifics right, because our audience won’t tolerate any mistakes,” he said. “Silicon Valley,” a show about computer nerds, has a fan base that is particularly attuned to minutiae, and particularly apt to argue about them on the Internet. If a Post-it, URL, or line of code is legible on the show, it will be screengrabbed and scrutinized. Last year, a few hours after an episode aired, a Reddit user with the handle HeIsMyPossum started a thread called “Why did the writers just obliterate all the good karma they had built up with their core audience?” He made an impassioned argument that a plot point—the accidental deletion of data from Pied Piper’s servers—was implausible. “So the files were being converted live while coming through an FTP? And that affects disk deletion speed?... Come the fuck on guys.” Rob Fuller, a software engineer and a consultant on the show, logged on to Reddit to defend his work, mostly by displaying his own nerd plumage. “Stuff like this happens,” he wrote. “I think even Amazon had an outage because one of the admins fat fingered a DNS or ACL change at one point.” Another user responded to Fuller: “Thanks for engaging us here, we really appreciate it.” The thread amassed nearly three hundred comments. “Sorry for being a dick,” HeIsMyPossum wrote. Dotan worked part-time for a few weeks, but then came on full-time. At first, he oversaw a staff of four: an expert in file compression; a user-interface engineer, to help write the code on the characters’ screens; a C-level tech executive; and a Silicon Valley lawyer, to draft realistic contracts. By the end of the first season, Dotan’s staff had grown to twelve. “If someone is holding a document on the show, that document is written out, in full, the way that it would be in real life,” Dotan said. “We don’t think of it in terms of, ‘How little can we get away with showing on camera?’ It’s more, like, ‘Let’s go through the process of making the world as complete as possible and see if that process leads us to better stuff.’ Which it usually does.” He is now one of the show’s producers, weighing in on the plot and tone as well as on abstruse technical matters. The first season ended with a climactic competition: Pied Piper’s compression algorithm pitted against that of its rival. “The writers wanted Richard to have an epiphany that would suddenly make his tech an order of magnitude better,” Dotan said. “So we had to invent a breakthrough—something that would be huge, but realistic.” Dotan called his compression expert, Tsachy Weissman, an engineering professor at Stanford. “He spent hours walking me through the very dense history of lossless compression,” Dotan said. “The way I understood it, basically, was that Claude Shannon, in 1948, worked on compressing files from the top down, using coding trees, whereas David Huffman, a few years later, approached it from the bottom up.” He made a PowerPoint presentation about this and delivered it to Judge and Berg. “They thought about it for a while, and then they said, ‘You mentioned top-down and bottom-up. What about starting in the middle of the data set and working from the middle out?’ So I asked Tsachy, ‘What about middle-out? Is that a thing?’ He didn’t say, ‘That’s ridiculous.’ He said, ‘That’s intriguing, actually. It might work.’” The show is shot on a Sony lot in Los Angeles. Credit 3 Arts Entertainment/Judgemental Films Inc/The Kobal Collection Credit 3 Arts Entertainment/Judgemental Films Inc/The Kobal Collection In the show, Richard’s “middle-out” epiphany is inspired not by a Stanford professor but by the most elaborate dick joke in TV history. To distract themselves from work, the Pied Piper engineers debate the quickest way to “jerk off every guy” in a crowd. (It’s a long story.) They belabor the point, drawing diagrams on a whiteboard. Eventually, one of them suggests that it might be maximally efficient if he “jerks off four guys at a time,” by aligning “two guys on either side, with their dicks tip to tip”—in other words, “from the middle out.” Richard’s eyes light up, buoyant strings begin to play in the background, and he walks to his computer and starts to code. In 2015, Weissman convened the Stanford Compression Forum, which resulted in a forty-page white paper outlining what middle-out compression might mean. One of his graduate students, Vinith Misra, worked out the math more explicitly in another paper. “Clearly, middle-out compression doesn’t work as well as it does on the show,” Dotan told me. “If it did, we’d all be trillionaires. But we do have an arrangement where, if Tsachy and Vinith ever perfect it, Mike and Alec will share the Nobel Prize with them.” Dotan now oversees more than two hundred consultants. Some work on set with him; a majority are available on an ad-hoc basis. Most are unpaid and uncredited. They include academics, investors, entrepreneurs, and employees at Google, Amazon, Netflix, and several other tech firms. “I might ask a quick, specific question, or we might just riff for a few hours,” Dotan said. Many of the show’s best jokes, if not most, emerge from this ongoing collaborative process. “I send links, tip them off to things I’ve heard, list the mockable buzzwords of the month,” Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist in Palo Alto, told me. “And I’m hardly the only one. For all I know, they have eyes and ears all over the Valley.” “Silicon Valley” is larded with brief appearances by tech-world mini celebrities that most viewers will miss, or will notice only by the incongruously stiff acting. But even careful viewers might not understand the complexity of the invisible web of communication between Silicon Valley and “Silicon Valley.” In addition to Dotan’s roster of consultants, Judge and Berg maintain informal conversations, both on and off the record, with several Silicon Valley bigwigs, including a few billionaires with either a sense of humor or an axe to grind. This kind of back-channel relationship—satirists texting casually with the satirized—is a departure from much of comedic history. Juvenal, whose “Satires” were published in the second century A.D., did not seem to be chummy with the Roman emperors he mocked, one of whom sentenced him to exile. It’s hard to imagine drunks in eighteenth-century London sitting for satirical portraits by William Hogarth, or King George II submitting jokes to Jonathan Swift. Swisher said that she still introduces Judge and Berg to Silicon Valley insiders such as Dick Costolo, who might prove useful to the show, “and who won’t be too full of themselves to take a joke.” One such person was Mark Pincus, who founded the gaming company Zynga. “When they said they wanted to meet at our office, I briefly went, ‘Are they just trying to collect the ammunition they need to make us into caricatures?’ And I cringed a bit when they saw our—we have this programmable tunnel thing that you walk through. It’s sort of hard to explain. Later, I did see something similar to the tunnel on their show. But, look, a lot of what happens out here is ridiculous. That’s fair game.” The relationship is symbiotic: the consultants get a small jolt of non-local fame—both Costolo and Pincus have cameos in an upcoming episode—and a chance to seem self-deprecating; the show’s creators can gather material, even when they don’t have their notebooks out. “Mike seems quiet and unassuming, but his brain is always clicking away, recording everything,” Swisher told me. “Which is a skill I covet, as a reporter.” Why, I asked, would it be in the interest of anyone in the tech industry to talk to Judge? Swisher responded with a rhetorical question: “Why do any of them talk to me?” The entrepreneur twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are among the many celebrities to have made a cameo appearance. *Courtesy HBO * Courtesy HBO Every summer, when the previous season has just ended and the next season is about to be written, “Silicon Valley”’s writers and producers take a research trip to Northern California. They spend a few nights in a San Francisco hotel and fill their days with meetings: a morning tour of GitHub’s office, where the foyer is a full-size replica of the Oval Office; lunch with Barry Schuler, a former C.E.O. of AOL; an afternoon on Sand Hill Road, in Menlo Park, visiting the world’s most valuable venture-capital funds; dinner with Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus at LB Steak. “We’ve had a few meals where it was me, Alec, and three or four billionaires,” Judge told me. “We sit back and observe the dynamic. One of them might be the alpha billionaire. Or one of them will go to the bathroom, and the others will lean in and start talking shit about him while he’s gone.” In an episode from the first season, two tech titans—former colleagues, now rivals—encounter each other at an LB Steak-like restaurant. A specific kind of awkwardness ensues: these are men who make million-dollar decisions without hesitation, but who struggle mightily with pleasantries. It’s the kind of interaction that is difficult to get right unless you’ve seen a version of it in real life. “They’ve asked me questions about Richard’s fictional company, like whether it would actually be fundable,” Marc Andreessen, a Web pioneer and a prominent venture capitalist, told me. “The technology, as described on the show, would certainly have a major impact if it existed. Could you turn it into a viable business? Unknown. But, in fairness, you could say that about half of the companies we fund.” Between the show’s first and second seasons, the writers waited in the lobby of Andreessen’s office, where photographs of hydrogen-bomb blasts hang on the walls. (“They’re a good way to make sure people are awake,” Andreessen’s spokesperson told me.) Then the writers were ushered into a conference room, where, for more than an hour, they sat around a blond-wood conference table while Andreessen pitched them jokes. “They weren’t terrible, either,” one of the writers told me. “I have eight dense pages of notes from that meeting. I have never heard a man speak as fast as Marc Andreessen.” None of his jokes appeared on the show in their original form, but a concept he explained—the downside of accepting too much free money from investors—became a scene in season two. In the TV version, the venture capitalist is a young woman, and the conversation begins with her interrupting Richard while he’s in the bathroom. Every summer, “Silicon Valley”’s writers and producers take a research trip to Northern California. Pictured: a meeting room in a cargo container at the GoogleX research lab, in Mountain View. *Photography by Brooks Kraft LLC / Corbis / Getty * Photography by Brooks Kraft LLC / Corbis / Getty During one visit to Google’s headquarters, in Mountain View, about six writers sat in a conference room with Astro Teller, the head of GoogleX, who wore a midi ring and kept his long hair in a ponytail. “Most of our research meetings are fun, but this one was uncomfortable,” Kemper told me. GoogleX is the company’s “moonshot factory,” devoted to projects, such as self-driving cars, that are difficult to build but might have monumental impact. Hooli, a multibillion-dollar company on “Silicon Valley,” bears a singular resemblance to Google. (The Google founder Larry Page, in Fortune: “We’d like to have a bigger impact on the world by doing more things.” Hooli’s C.E.O., in season two: “I don’t want to live in a world where someone makes the world a better place better than we do.”) The previous season, Hooli had launched HooliXYZ, its own “moonshot factory,” whose experiments were slapstick absurdities: monkeys who use bionic arms to masturbate; powerful cannons for launching potatoes across a room. “He claimed he hadn’t seen the show, and then he referred many times to specific things that had happened on the show,” Kemper said. “His message was, ‘We don’t do stupid things here. We do things that actually are going to change the world, whether you choose to make fun of that or not.’ ” (Teller could not be reached for comment.) Teller ended the meeting by standing up in a huff, but his attempt at a dramatic exit was marred by the fact that he was wearing Rollerblades. He wobbled to the door in silence. “Then there was this awkward moment of him fumbling with his I.D. badge, trying to get the door to open,” Kemper said. “It felt like it lasted an hour. We were all trying not to laugh. Even while it was happening, I knew we were all thinking the same thing: Can we use this?” In the end, the joke was deemed “too hacky to use on the show.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Silicon Valley, the HBO sitcom that revolves around the fictional technology of a group of software engineers, is reportedly so factually accurate in its portrayal of the world of technology that some viewers have been left perplexed.

(2) He hit a home run., does the word hit mean the same thing?","output":"To determine if the word \\"hit\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the context of each sentence. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of \\"hit\\" in each context. Step 3: Compare the meanings to see if they are the same. Step 1: Identify the context of each sentence. (1) \\"He hit her hard in the face.\\" The context here implies a physical act of violence, where one person is causing harm to another person's face. (2) \\"He hit a home run.\\" The context here is related to sports, specifically baseball, where a player successfully strikes the ball with the aim of scoring a home run. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of \\"hit\\" in each context. (1) In the first sentence, \\"hit\\" means to physically strike someone with force, causing harm or pain. (2) In the second sentence, \\"hit\\" means to successfully strike a baseball with a bat, propelling it far enough to allow the batter to circle all bases and score a home run. Step 3: Compare the meanings to see if they are the same. While the word \\"hit\\" in both sentences shares the similarity of making contact, its meaning differs across contexts. In the first sentence, \\"hit\\" refers to an act of violence, whereas, in the second sentence, it refers to a successful action in a sports game.

In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born. Now, what is this review like? Select from: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"This review can be categorized as (a). negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the character development, storyline, and predictability of the Speedy Gonzalez cartoons, particularly in their later years when he was paired with Daffy Duck. They mention that the character of Speedy has very limited attributes and even go as far as to describe him as \\"detestable\\" and \\"cocky.\\" In addition, the reviewer finds Sylvester's role lacking, as they believe that being a mere pursuer takes away from his potential uniqueness and personality. Furthermore, the reviewer laments the fact that this particular cartoon won an Oscar and paved the way for the creation of more similarly underwhelming shorts featuring Speedy Gonzalez. Overall, the tone and focus of the review are predominantly negative, as the reviewer points out various shortcomings and offers little in the way of praise or appreciation."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: Is \\"As of May 2015, her net worth is estimated to be 250 million.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Up until May of 2015, how much is Beyonce's total worth?\\" Choices: (I) yes (II) no","output":"(II) No Although the given answer does provide an estimated net worth for Beyonce as of May 2015, it is not the most suitable answer to the question \\"Up until May of 2015, how much is Beyonce's total worth?\\" A better answer would not only provide the net worth figure but also include relevant details about her career, sources of income, and factors that contributed to the increase in her total worth up until that point. A more comprehensive and detailed response could be as follows: Up until May of 2015, Beyonce's total worth is estimated to be around 250 million. Beyonce has been a prominent figure in the music industry since the late 1990s when she gained fame as a member of the girl group Destiny's Child. Over the years, her successful solo career, numerous endorsements, and various business ventures have contributed significantly to her wealth. Beyonce's earnings are mainly derived from her music sales, concert tours, and royalties. Some of her most successful albums include 'Dangerously in Love' (2003), 'B'Day' (2006), 'I Am... Sasha Fierce' (2008), and the self-titled visual album 'Beyonce' (2013). Additionally, her concert tours, such as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014) and the On The Run Tour (2014) with her husband Jay-Z, have garnered massive earnings from ticket sales and merchandising. Moreover, Beyonce has starred in several films, such as Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009), further adding to her net worth. Endorsement deals with big brands like L'Oreal, Pepsi, and H&M have also contributed to her earnings, as well as her fashion line, House of Dereon, which was launched in partnership with her mother. It is also essential to note that Beyonce has been recognized for her philanthropic work and social activism. These endeavors, although not directly impacting her net worth, add to her overall value as a public figure and influencer. In conclusion, as of May 2015, Beyonce's estimated total worth of 250 million has been accumulated through her thriving music career, endorsements, business ventures, and other diverse sources of income."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Please proceed, Mr Schulz.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In Romanian, you would say \\"Vă rog continuați, domnule Schulz.\\" Isn't that interesting?

A:","output":"The last step of the process is the formation of a black hole or another end-stage stellar remnant, depending on the initial mass of the star. After the star has exhausted its nuclear fuel and the core has collapsed under the immense pressure and gravity, several possibilities are determined by the star's mass: 1. For stars with a relatively lower mass (less than three solar masses), the gravitational force becomes balanced by the electron degeneracy pressure, preventing further collapse. This results in the formation of a compact and hot stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. Over time, the white dwarf cools down and ultimately becomes a cold, inert black dwarf. However, black dwarfs are only theoretical, as the universe is not old enough for any white dwarf to have cooled sufficiently to become a black dwarf. 2. If the star has a mass between three and twenty solar masses, its gravitational forces overcome the electron degeneracy pressure, and the core collapses even further. This triggers a supernova explosion, a massive and violent outburst of energy that expels the outer layers of the star into space. In the aftermath of a supernova, the remnant core becomes a neutron star, with its particles compressed into neutrons and held up by the neutron degeneracy pressure. 3. If the star is particularly massive (over twenty solar masses), the gravitational forces at play are so strong that even the neutron degeneracy pressure cannot resist the core's collapsing forces. As a result, the core contracts indefinitely, leading to the formation of a black hole. At this stage, the gravitational pull becomes so intense that nothing – not even light – can escape it, rendering the black hole invisible save for the detectable effects it has on surrounding matter and the bending of light near its event horizon. Black holes can vary in size, from stellar-mass black holes formed by a single star to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. In conclusion, the last step in the process described depends on the star's initial mass. If the mass is sufficient to overcome different pressure resistances (electron degeneracy pressure or neutron degeneracy pressure), the star can turn into a black hole. Otherwise, it may become a white dwarf or a neutron star. In any case, the final stage represents the resting place for the star's remaining mass and the end of the star’s life cycle."},{"instruction":"Is song used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? The song of bullets was in the air. He bought it for a song.","output":"No, the word \\"song\\" is used to convey different meanings in the given two sentences. Let's break down each sentence to understand the context within which \\"song\\" is used. 1) \\"The song of bullets was in the air.\\" In this sentence, \\"song\\" is used metaphorically to represent the sound or noise made by bullets. This is a poetic expression, where the word \\"song,\\" typically used to describe a piece of music, is employed to evoke a vivid image or atmosphere associated with the sound of bullets flying through the air. In this context, \\"song\\" is not referring to an actual musical composition, but rather, it is being used as a literary device to help readers visualize and understand the intensity of the situation. 2) \\"He bought it for a song.\\" In this sentence, the expression \\"for a song\\" is an idiomatic phrase. It means that the person bought something at a significantly low price, much less than its actual worth or market value. The origin of this idiom is likely connected to the fact that songs or melodies have been historically regarded as inexpensive or intangible. The idiom does not refer to the actual buying of a song or a piece of music. Instead, it's a way of saying that the person bought the item at an incredibly low or cheap price. Moreover, it implies that the buyer got a great deal on the purchase. In summary, the word \\"song\\" is used in different contexts within these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"song\\" acts as a metaphor for the sound of bullets, while in the second sentence, it is part of an idiomatic expression that conveys the idea of purchasing something at a very low price. Although both sentences use the word \\"song,\\" the meaning significantly differs based on the surrounding context and expressions."},{"instruction":"Following their road win over the Dolphins, the Cowboys traveled to Soldier Field to play a Sunday night match with the defending NFC Champion Bears.

It establishes a proportional relationship between the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity and the electrical conductivity of a metallic conductor at a constant temperature. In simpler terms, it links the transport properties of heat and electricity in metals. The law can be mathematically expressed as: L = κ / σT Where: L stands for the Lorenz number – a constant depending on the fundamental constants of nature, κ represents the electronic part of the thermal conductivity, σ denotes the electrical conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. In this equation, the Lorenz number (L) remains constant for different materials and temperatures, as long as the relationship between the thermal and electrical conductivities remains constant. It is important to note that this law is most accurate for pure metallic elements with free electrons and is less precise for alloys or other complex structures. The Weidemann-Franz Law has significant implications in the fields of materials science, engineering, and applied physics. For instance, it helps researchers understand the behavior of materials at various temperatures and how their thermal and electrical properties are related. This information is crucial for designing materials and devices with optimal thermal and electrical conductivities, as well as for developing efficient energy conversion technologies, such as thermoelectric generators. In summary, the Weidemann-Franz Law is a vital principle in solid-state physics that provides a relationship between the thermal and electrical conductivities in metallic conductors at a constant temperature. It helps scientists and engineers optimize material properties, contributing to the advancement of various technologies and applications."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending.

He says that \\"breaking apart rocks can cause debris\\" and \\"sledge hammers can be used to break especially hard ledges of rock\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What can be used to make debris?\\" is that various tools and methods can be employed to create debris by breaking apart rocks and other materials. One of the most effective tools for this purpose is a sledgehammer, as mentioned by the teacher, which can be used to break especially hard ledges of rock. Debris can be generated through both natural processes and human activities. In the context of the hints provided by the teacher, it becomes clear that the focus here is on human-driven actions that create debris by breaking down rocks and other solid materials. Some of the common tools and techniques used for this purpose include: 1. Sledgehammers: As stated by the teacher, sledgehammers are heavy-duty tools designed for breaking large and hard rocks or concrete structures. The long handle and heavy, flat head of the sledgehammer provide ample force to break apart materials, generating debris in the process. 2. Chisels: Chisels are sharp-edged, steel tools that can be used to chip away at rocks or other hard surfaces. Usually, a chisel is used in conjunction with a hammer to deliver force and split or carve the target material. 3. Pickaxes: Pickaxes are versatile tools commonly used in excavation and mining operations. With a sharp point on one end and a flat edge on the other, pickaxes can break and dislodge rocks, effectively generating debris. 4. Explosives: In large-scale mining or construction projects, controlled explosions can be used to fragment rocks and create debris. The use of explosives requires careful planning and execution to prevent accidents and minimize environmental impact. 5. Heavy machinery: In industrial settings, heavy machinery, such as hydraulic breakers, mounted on excavators, can efficiently break rocks and generate debris. 6. Natural processes: While not a tool, it is important to note that natural processes, such as erosion, weathering, and tectonic activities, can cause rock formations to break apart and create debris over time. In conclusion, debris can be generated through the use of various tools, like sledgehammers, chisels, pickaxes, explosives, and heavy machinery, or through natural processes that break down rocks and other materials. The most appropriate answer for this quiz question is that sledgehammers and other tools can be effectively used to create debris by breaking apart rocks."},{"instruction":"\\"my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","output":"The sentiment of this sentence can be perceived as negative and filled with disappointment.

Penelope Longstreet reacted emotionally to this revelation, increasing the strain of the meeting. In the midst of dealing with their sons' altercation, other serious issues also came up, including a controversial drug that Alan was defending, that coincidentally was prescribed to Michael's mother, and Penelope's present dealings with the themes of idealism and responsibility. In summary, the parents who met in a Brooklyn apartment were Alan and Nancy Cowan, parents of Zachary Cowan, and Michael and Penelope Longstreet, parents of Ethan Longstreet. Their meeting unfolded into a complex and challenging conversation reflecting not just their children’s situation but also their personal issues and perspectives."},{"instruction":"Подключитесь к ресурсу с помощью консоли внешнего управления.

After that initial shooting, Samuel Duran ran and hopped fences in a Roseville neighborhood as members of various law enforcement agencies converged on the scene, police said. Authorities located him at an otherwise unoccupied house in Roseville, which is 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. \\"I know he's pinned down,\\" Roseville police Lt. Cal Walstad said. Duran has been sought by authorities \\"for the last couple of weeks,\\" according to Walstad, who did not detail what crimes the suspect had been tied to. After determining where he was in Roseville, local police and a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit went there Friday afternoon. According to Walstad, \\"once they made contact with him, shots were exchanged.\\" The ICE special agent was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital, the police spokesman said. He was reported to be stable and alert a few hours later, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. The suspect ran, firing at times and jumping fences. Three Roseville police officers ended up wounded at a third shooting site . One was struck in the jaw, one was hit in the shoulder, and the third wounded by bullet fragments, according to Walstad. One of the Roseville officers was in serious condition, while the other two were stable, he said. Chief Daniel Hahn added later Friday that none of the injuries to the officers, all of them men and veterans of the department, are considered life-threatening. Authorities from multiple agencies quickly converged on the scene looking for Duran, who Walstad said had an \\"assault-type weapon.\\" Neighbors were asked not to leave their houses, but they were never evacuated. The scene was later considered \\"contained\\" -- even though police hadn't said they knew exactly where the suspect was. Now that they do, he's being surrounded by law enforcement. Hostage negotiations are on site as well, though it's not believed that the suspect has taken any hostages. Authorities are talking to the suspect by telephone, Walstad said. Brenda Bell told CNN affiliate KCRA that the suspect is in her house; she went outside after her \\"dogs went crazy,\\" then she ran into a neighbor's house after seeing him run through her back gate. \\"(Police) keep repeating, 'We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up,'\\" Jim Stewart, the neighbor who invited Bell in, said Friday night. \\"They've been doing this for hours now.\\" Placer County Sheriff Edward Bonner described the situation as \\"incredibly dangerous,\\" while expressing confidence it'll be resolved as well as possible. \\"This is a very tough day,\\" Bonner said. \\"It's unsettling for all us; no one is immune to this sort of tragedy and criminality.

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily.

He was grappling with his pledge to Nicolette, wondering if it was a lie, given that he still had feelings for Diane.

Hint: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it does not give a direct answer to the question on who needs less vitamin C in their diet. However, we can reason that since girls between the ages of 14 and 18 need more iron (15 mg) daily compared to boys between the ages of 14 and 18 (11 mg), Jessica might have a higher requirement for vitamin C in her diet. This is because vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron in the body.

Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"The claim that \\"The best way to play Scrabble is alone\\" cannot be deemed as universally true or false, as it depends on individual preferences and objectives. Scrabble is traditionally designed as a multiplayer game, enjoyed by two to four players. However, some people may prefer to play alone for specific reasons. Let's discuss the pros and cons of each option: Playing Scrabble with others: 1. Social interaction: Playing with family or friends can promote bonding and strengthen relationships. 2. Mental challenge: Competing against others can add an element of excitement and challenge, and it can also stimulate your brain. 3. Skill improvement: Playing with others might expose you to new strategies and help improve your performance. 4. Entertainment: Engaging with others during the game can lead to laughter, conversation, and an overall enjoyable experience. Playing Scrabble alone: 1. Practice: Playing alone is an excellent opportunity to practice and improve your skills without any pressure. 2. Solitary enjoyment: Those looking for a quiet, introspective pastime may find playing alone rewarding. 3. At your own pace: When playing alone, you can take as much time as you need to contemplate potential moves and learn new words. 4. Flexibility: Playing alone allows you to play whenever and wherever you like, without the need to coordinate schedules with others. In conclusion, the best way to play Scrabble depends on the individual's preferences and objectives. If one values social interaction, mental challenge, and skill improvement, playing with others may be the best choice. However, if someone prefers solitude, practicing skills, and flexibility in scheduling, they might find playing alone to be the best option."},{"instruction":"Kuten on jo todettu, sen lisäksi, että Ai Weiwei on erittäin kuuluisa taiteilija, hän on myös yksi kommunistihallinnon suurimmista arvostelijoista.

On the other hand, the phrase \\"So sad\\" reveals a sense of empathy, sadness, and disappointment towards the end of Jon and Kate's marriage. Beyond the primary emotions of surprise and sadness, the tweet may imply further levels of concern or disapproval. For instance, the description of the legal proceedings that \\"happened TODAY\\" creates a sense of urgency and suddenness, possibly suggesting that the person who tweeted this may think that the event was rushed or untimely. Additionally, the exclamation \\"So sad\\" could highlight that the dissolution is being seen as a tragic event, maybe reflecting the belief that Jon and Kate should have sought other means for resolving their issues rather than seeking a legal dissolution of their marriage.

Now, let's rearrange the equation to make it easier to solve. If you look at it now, it is -5*x = 49*x - 810. But, let's move the x-values to one side by adding 5*x to both sides so we have 0 on one side. This will give us 0 = 54*x - 810. Next, we want to isolate x (or, in simpler terms, find out what magic number x is!). To do this, let's move the 810 to the other side of the equation by adding 810 to both sides giving us, 810 = 54*x. Finally, let's find x by dividing 810 by 54 (because division is the opposite of multiplication!). So 810 divided by 54 (810/54) gives an exact answer of 15 as the value for x. Isn't it fun?

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision.

Importantly, the name itself is not a direct reference to Peru, but rather to the timing of the phenomenon (i.e., the holiday season). While the geographical area of El Nino's effects, especially off the coast of Peru, plays a significant role in the naming decision, the association to Christmas is the main reason for its name. Consequently, the hypothesis claiming that El Nino is named after Peru is not accurate. Instead, it is named based on the time of year when the impact of the climate event typically occurs and is noticeable, which is around the Christmas season."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Digital Video Systems - Digital Video Systems AG (DVS) is a German company specializing in digital cinema equipment.DVS is headquartered in Hannover Germany and is a leading manufacturer of high-performance digital video products for film TV post production and research and development.

A new biography described his life and accomplishments. A stand-up comedy special on Netflix, commemorating his 77th birthday, was set for next week. His collection of African-American art became part of an exhibition at the Smithsonian this month. And NBC was exploring a project that would bring him back to prime time, where in the 1980s he became America’s pre-eminent TV star with “The Cosby Show.” But in recent weeks, his triumphant return to the national stage has fallen apart in the face of a wave of accusations by women who say Mr. Cosby drugged and raped them decades ago. On Wednesday, NBC said it was canceling the pilot project, and the cable network TV Land quietly stopped showing repeats of “The Cosby Show.” Less than 24 hours earlier, Netflix said it was postponing the debut of the comedy special. Other scheduled appearances by Mr. Cosby — on David Letterman’s late-night show and Queen Latifah’s daytime talk show — have also been canceled. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers have vigorously denied the accusations in recent days, and he has never faced criminal charges. But the troubles have put the star’s comeback in limbo and created awkward situations as he seeks to burnish his legacy. Mr. Cosby’s handlers, for instance, realized that Mr. Letterman would have to ask Mr. Cosby about the rape claims, and so scrapped the appearance on the show. During an interview on Nov. 6 with The Associated Press, Bill Cosby refused to respond to allegations of sexual assault after the reporter brought up recent reports. The accusations against Mr. Cosby have been all the more striking because his hit TV show, his commercials for Jell-O and his best-selling books about fatherhood helped him present an image of the ideal family man. A series of suddenly converging factors contributed to tearing that down. They included a viral video of an emerging comedian, Hannibal Buress, who bluntly called Mr. Cosby a rapist in his act, and an ill-conceived effort to solicit positive comments about Mr. Cosby on an Internet meme, which inspired a chorus of contributors to call him a rapist. In the meantime, four women have come forward publicly in recent days to repeat the decades-old accusations of being drugged, raped or molested. The reach of the web and the impact of social media have provided a distribution platform for these accusations, which had surfaced before but never gained widespread traction. Martin Kaplan, the Norman Lear chair in entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California’s journalism school, said a combination of social media and Mr. Cosby’s return to the spotlight had propelled the story to much greater prominence than when the accusations surfaced in the past. “The fact that he was already in the public spotlight — the book, the potential deal with NBC and so on — and the fact that these charges have a much more powerful amplifier and echo chamber, it gives people the sense that this is a big story,” he said. The current furor surrounding Mr. Cosby had its root in accusations brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, a female staff member with the basketball team at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby. The district attorney at the time in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, Bruce L. Castor Jr., said in an interview on Wednesday that he did not feel that he had enough evidence to pursue a criminal case at the time, “despite the fact that I thought Cosby was guilty of some improper behavior — my gut told me that.” A subsequent lawsuit brought by Ms. Constand promised to present testimony from 13 “Jane Does” with similar accounts of sexual assault. Mr. Cosby’s lawyer called the claims false and even preposterous; the suit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2006. One of the unnamed women in the suit, Barbara Bowman, a former actress, came forward publicly in The Washington Post last week to describe her experiences in detail, saying she was drugged and raped by Mr. Cosby in the 1980s. But women had been describing similar episodes with Mr. Cosby in the eight years since the suit was settled. Ms. Bowman spoke about her charges to Philadelphia magazine and People magazine in 2006. Newsweek magazine had interviews with both Ms. Bowman and another accuser, Tamara Green, this February without setting off the whirlwind of attention that has surrounded Mr. Cosby in the last two weeks. But Mr. Cosby’s career was not ascendant at the time. Mark Whitaker, the author of the biography that contributed to the controversy — partly because Mr. Whitaker did not address the rape charges in his book — said Mr. Cosby’s revived career had thrust him back into national attention again. “He was not hiding,” Mr. Whitaker said. “He was on the road doing 60 concerts a year. But in terms of visibility, he was doing things he had not done in quite a while.” Mr. Whitaker, the former top editor at Newsweek, cited events surrounding the 30th anniversary of “The Cosby Show,” the 50th anniversary of the start of Mr. Cosby’s career and two stand-up concert films that Mr. Cosby had planned. Then he agreed to try to return to prime time on NBC. “He was putting himself out there,” Mr. Whitaker said. Mr. Whitaker said his book did not address the accusations because he could not verify them. If the comeback brought Mr. Cosby the adulation of his fans, it also revived the outrage of his accusers. In addition to Ms. Bowman, a writer named Joan Tarshis came forward for the first time to tell a story of being drugged and raped on two occasions in 1969. “I had wanted to get it off my chest for a long time,” Ms. Tarshis said in a telephone interview. “When I was approached by tabloids in 2005, a tabloid was not the way I wanted to go.” The piece by Ms. Bowman inspired her to finally speak out, she said. Janice Dickinson, a well-known former model, added her name to the list of accusers, saying Mr. Cosby brought her to Lake Tahoe in 1982 and drugged and raped her. That charge has drawn the most virulent response; a lawyer for Mr. Cosby, Martin Singer, called Ms. Dickinson’s claim a “fabricated lie.” Another of Mr. Cosby’s lawyers, John P. Schmitt, earlier had made a blanket denial of the charges by the women as “old and discredited.” In some states, for serious sexual crimes, prosecutions would still be timely. But Benjamin Brafman, an experienced criminal defense lawyer who represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said there would be serious obstacles in making any criminal case against Mr. Cosby at this stage because of the passage of time and the lack of forensic evidence. The end of the prospective project with NBC may be the most painful development for the comedian. Several people with knowledge of the project said that it originated when Mr. Cosby approached the network with an idea to return to weekly situation comedy. A deal like that would almost surely include a penalty payment to the comic if the project was terminated early. NBC was excited enough about the prospect that it announced the project to the news media in July, very early in the process. By all accounts, the decision to drop it now was influenced by the news swirling around Mr. Cosby. Many other stars have bounced back from accusations that damaged their reputation, but Mr. Cosby may find that challenging. The harsh judgment of social media will be difficult to overcome, Mr. Kaplan of the University of Southern California said. “Social media is many things, among them it gives people a belief of what people are talking about,” he said, “which is something larger than what they see on television or read in the papers.” An article on Thursday about the effect of accusations of past sexual misbehavior on the current career of the comedian Bill Cosby described incorrectly in some editions the accusations brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, then an employee at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby, not drugged and raped. The article also gave an outdated title for Bruce L. Castor Jr., who commented on the case. He was district attorney in Montgomery County when Ms. Constand made her accusations; he is not the current district attorney. And because of an editing error, the article misstated the time elapsed since Ms. Constand’s suit was settled in 2006. It is eight years, not nine.

Despite Cosby's adamant denials of these accusations, the resulting public outrage forced NBC and Netflix, among other platforms, to cancel his upcoming appearances, leaving the future of Cosby's career uncertain at the moment. Here is a detailed explanation: At the close of a successful and celebrated career, Bill Cosby seemed poised to make a triumphant return to prominence in the entertainment industry. There were reasons for optimism. A new biography outlined his career, achievements, and personal life. Netflix had planned a stand-up comedy special, celebrating his 77th birthday. His collection of African-American art was part of an exhibition at the Smithsonian, and NBC had even entertained ideas of a project that would return the comedian to primetime television, a platform he had dominated in the 1980s with \\"The Cosby Show.\\" However, these plans were thrown asunder by a wave of rape accusations against Cosby by several women, who claimed that the comedian had drugged and raped them years ago. The accusations were not new – they had surfaced earlier but had failed to gain significant traction. The difference this time was the widespread visibility brought on by the web and the impact of social media. Among the accusers was Andrea Constand, a Temple University staff member. She brought forth accusations in 2005, claiming that Cosby had drugged and molested her. Although the district attorney at the time did not pursue a criminal case due to a lack of evidence, a subsequent lawsuit brought by Constand pledged to bring forth testimonies from 13 other women with similar accounts of sexual assault by Cosby. The suit, fiercely contested by Cosby's lawyer, was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. Despite these and other accusations, Cosby’s comeback seemed unstoppable. In part, this resilience was due to Cosby's cultivated public image of the ideal family man, reinforced by his TV show, endorsements, and books about fatherhood. But the driving force was his influence and power as one of America's revered performers. Unfortunately for Cosby, the revival of his career, which had invigorated his fans, also brought renewed attention to the accusations. The unearthing of the accusations was aided in large part by the internet and social media. A viral video of comedian Hannibal Buress, in which he bluntly labelled Cosby a rapist, and the comedian's own misguided effort to solicit positive comments on a web meme (which backfired spectacularly), breathed life into the accusations. In the fallout, several platforms distanced themselves from Cosby. NBC canceled a proposed pilot project, and TV Land ceased showing reruns of \\"The Cosby Show\\". Less than a day prior, Netflix had postponed the stand-up comedy special. For Cosby, these setbacks could not have come at a worse time. After a lull, Cosby had returned to the limelight with a vengeance, with multiple concerts a year and plans for two stand-up comedy films. However, with these new and old accusations coming to the fore, his triumphal return to the national stage has withered in the face of public outrage, throwing the future of his career into uncertainty."},{"instruction":"Steven Eugene Corino (born May 29, 1973) is a Canadian semi-retired professional wrestler currently signed with WWE as a trainer for their developmental territory NXT. He is best known for his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name Steve Corino. Corino has held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, the MLW World Heavyweight Championship, and the 1PW World Heavyweight Championship once each, and the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship and the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship twice each. In addition to these titles, he has also held the ROH World Tag Team Championship once, as well as numerous titles on the independent circuit. In 1998, Corino debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling as a heel manager. He stood out in ECW as a result of his \\"King of Old School\\" gimmick, where he would deride hardcore wrestlers, at one point invading a Limp Bizkit concert and protesting the immoral conduct. In late 1999, Corino took Jack Victory on as a manager, and became an advisor for Tajiri and Rhino. He then began feuding with Dusty Rhodes, who defeated him in a gory Bullrope match at Living Dangerously. At Heat Wave 2000, he lost to Jerry Lynn. Corino went on to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on November 5, 2000 at November to Remember by defeating Justin Credible, Sandman and Champion Jerry Lynn in a Double Jeopardy match; then to successfully defend it at Massacre on 34th Street in December against Jerry Lynn and Justin Credible in a 3 way dance. Due to repeated failures of ECW paying Corino his salary, he left the company on January 7, 2001, the night he lost the ECW World Title at Guilty as Charged 2001 to Sandman. His friend Dustin Rhodes got him a contract in World Championship Wrestling, but he never got to make an appearance despite being due to debut at the company's third to last PPV Sin. When World Wrestling Entertainment took over WCW in March 2001, they released Corino from his contract. He went on to wrestle for many of the National Wrestling Alliance regional promotions.

The haunting memories of Hitler's concentration camps and the Soviet Union's murders of Polish officers in Katyn refer to two of the most horrific events that took place during World War II. Both events have left a deep impact on the collective memory of those who were directly or indirectly affected by them. In the case of Hitler's concentration camps, millions of people, primarily Jews, were systematically persecuted, tortured, and killed during the Holocaust. From 1941 to 1945, these camps were used as extermination centers to eliminate \\"undesirable\\" individuals, such as Jews, homosexuals, gypsies, disabled, and dissidents, to name a few. The Nazi regime established a network of concentration camps and extermination centers across German-occupied Europe, with Auschwitz being the most infamous and deadly. The memories of these concentration camps evoke feelings of horror and grief, as victims and survivors often returned to their homes to find their families gone and their communities destroyed. The effects of these camps are still felt today, as both physical and psychological scars remain, and the atrocities committed continue to be a significant subject of study and discussion in order to prevent such horrors from happening again. Similarly, the Soviet Union's murders of Polish officers in Katyń also hold a tragic place in history. In 1940, in the wake of the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, approximately 22,000 Polish military officers, intellectuals, and other members of the elite were executed by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD. These mass executions took place in the Katyń Forest, which is where the event gets its name. These murders were initially denied by the Soviet regime, leading to a long-lasting controversy regarding the truth of the events. The gravity of these two historic events is still felt today, with various memorials and commemorations being held to honor the victims and ensure that these acts are not forgotten. By understanding the depth of human cruelty that took place during these occurrences, the hope is that future generations will be inspired to work toward a world where such atrocities cease to exist."},{"instruction":"L’ACSTA a axé ses efforts sur la mise en place d’un effectif bien formé et disposant des équipements appropriés pour assurer des services de contrôle CPE et CBE aux aéroports désignés.

They lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and have a rudimentary excretory system. The digestive system is incomplete in most species. There are four traditional classes of flatworms, the largely free-living turbellarians, the ectoparasitic monogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes. Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a secondary mollusk host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place. Cestodes, or tapeworms, infect the digestive systems of primary vertebrate hosts. Nematodes are pseudocoelomate members of the clade Ecdysozoa. They have a complete digestive system and a pseudocoelomic body cavity. This phylum includes free-living as well as parasitic organisms. They include dioecious and hermaphroditic species. Nematodes have a poorly developed excretory system. Embryonic development is external and proceeds through larval stages separated by molts. Arthropods represent the most successful phylum of animals on Earth, in terms of number of species as well as the number of individuals. They are characterized by a segmented body and jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the phylum, classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages. Arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. Gills, tracheae, and book lungs facilitate respiration. Embryonic development may include multiple larval stages. Q: What phylum has the highest number of species on earth? A: A:","output":"The phylum with the highest number of species on Earth is Arthropoda."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Were there more firefighters or law enforcement officers killed in the attacks?\\" is in \\"The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area.

He was the grandson of Cleomenes II and was succeeded by his son Acrotatus II. - Agesipolis II (died 369 BC), son of the king Cleombrotus I, succeeded his father and reigned as Agiad King of Sparta. His rule was exceedingly brief, from, at most, 371 until his death in 369 BC. He was succeeded by his brother Cleomenes II. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - Cleomenes II (died 309 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from 369 to 309 BC. The son of Cleombrotus I, he succeeded his brother Agesipolis II. He was the father of Acrotatus I, the father of Areus I, and of Cleonymus, the father of Leonidas II. - Cleombrotus I ( Greek : ; died July 6 , 371 BC ) was a Spartan king of the Agiad line , reigning from 380 BC until 371 BC. Little is known of Cleombrotus ' early life . Son of Pausanias , he became king of Sparta after the death of his brother Agesipolis I in 380 BC , and led the allied Spartan - Peloponnesian army against the Thebans under Epaminondas in the Battle of Leuctra . His death and the utter defeat of his army led to the end of Spartan dominance in ancient Greece . Cleombrotus was succeeded by his son Agesipolis II. His other son was Cleomenes II. Many historians cite Cleombrotus as being a Pro-Theban Spartan ( meaning he had pro-Theban tendencies ) unlike his fellow king , Agesilaus II. He was blamed for the humiliating defeat at Leuctra by his contemporaries for being biased towards the enemy , though some modern historians do not believe that he was actually pro-Theban . - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Leonidas II (Greek: B, \\"Lion's son\\", \\"Lion-like\\"), was the 28th Agiad King of Sparta from 254 to 235 BC. He was raised at the Persian Court, and according to Plutarch's Life of Agis IV, he married a Persian woman. According to other sources, this non-Spartan wife was actually a Seleucid, possibly the daughter of Seleucus I Nicator by his Persian wife Apama. She was therefore not fully Persian, but half-Macedonian and half-Persian. His Persian-influenced lifestyle, his non-Spartan (therefore foreign) wife and his half-Spartan children would all be made issues by the ephor Lysander, the co-king Agis IV and their supporters. - Acrotatus I (Gr. ) was the son of Cleomenes II, king of Sparta. He incurred the displeasure of an influential group of Spartan citizens by opposing the decree which was to release from infamy all who had fled from the battle in which Antipater defeated Agis in 331 BC. He was thus glad to accept the offer from the Agrigentines who had asked Sparta for assistance in 314 BC against Agathocles of Syracuse. - Epaminondas (\\"Epameinondas\\"; d. 362 BC) was a Theban general and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the Ancient Greek city-state of Thebes, leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics. In the process he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots, a group of Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years after being defeated in the Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several major battlefield tactics.

Stream of consciousness:","output":"You've provided options that are percentages, but to find the time it takes for a sum of money to double at a 6% simple interest rate, we need to find the number of years. So first let's rephrase the question: In how many years will a sum of money double itself at a 6% per annum simple interest rate? To solve this, we'll use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) Here, the principal amount (P) is doubled, meaning the simple interest gained is equal to the principal. 2P = P + (P × R × T) Let's plug in the rate (R) as 0.06 (6% in decimal form) and solve for the time (T): 2P = P + (P × 0.06 × T) P = P × 0.06 × T 1 = 0.06 × T Now, let's solve for T: T = 1 / 0.06 T = 16.67 (approximately) So, it will take approximately 16 and 2/3 years (16 years and 8 months) for the sum of money to double itself at a 6% per annum simple interest rate."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

Some of these factors include the context, motivation, intensity of the play, and whether they are following any official rules or guidelines related to frisbee championships. 1. Context: Understanding the context of their actions is important to draw any conclusions. Are they practicing in an informal setting like a park or beach? If so, they might simply be enjoying a casual game of frisbee among friends. On the other hand, if they are playing in a serious tournament or competition, there is a higher likelihood that they are, in fact, trying to win a frisbee championship. 2. Motivation: In order to determine if they are really trying to win a frisbee championship, one must analyze their motivation behind playing the game. They could be playing for casual entertainment, exercise, or to bond with each other. Alternatively, they might be highly motivated individuals who have been training for some time to excel in frisbee championships. 3. Intensity: The intensity of their play can reveal their intentions. If they are pushing their limits and playing with great rigor, precision, and focus on their movements, it could suggest that they are trying to improve their skills to compete in a championship. However, if they are playing at a relaxed pace and not seriously trying to outdo each other or themselves, it is more likely that they are not aiming for a frisbee championship. 4. Rules and guidelines: Competitive frisbee events, such as Ultimate Frisbee or Disc Golf, have specific rules and guidelines that govern the gameplay. Observing if the two players are strictly adhering to these rules or simply playing a friendly game with self-imposed rules can provide insights into their intention to compete at a higher level. 5. Team play: Almost all frisbee championships involve team play rather than individuals competing against each other. If these two players are practicing together as teammates, there might be a greater chance of their involvement in a frisbee championship. However, if they are playing against each other in a one-on-one setting, this scenario is less typical of a championship context. In conclusion, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively state that the two players are attempting to win a frisbee championship. To arrive at a more accurate conclusion, one must observe the context, motivation, intensity of play, adherence to rules and guidelines, and possible team involvement. Merely playing with a frisbee and jumping high does not necessarily indicate that their goal is to win a championship."},{"instruction":"In 1620,about half the USA was covered by forests .Today the forests have almost gone .A lot of good land has gone with them ,leaving only sand .China doesn't want to copy the USA's example.We're planting more and more tress .We've built the \\"Great Green Wall \\"of tress across northern pat of our country .The \\"Great Green Wall\\"is 7,000 kilometers long ,and between 400 and 1,700 kilometers wide .It will stop the wind from blowing the earth away .It will stop the sand from moving towards the rich farmland in the south .More \\"Great Green Wall \\"are needed .Trees must be grown all over the world. \\"Great Green Wall \\"will make the world better . ,.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single.

McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Both men were later pronounced dead at a hospital. A 51-year-old man was the third person killed in the shootings at an off-campus home not far from the university's football stadium, College Station Assistant Police Chief Scott McCollum said. Three other law enforcement officers and a 55-year-old woman were wounded, he said. Officers responding to reports of an officer down saw Bachmann wounded on the ground in the front yard, then got into what McCollum described as an extended shootout with Caffall, who eventually was shot. \\"Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy,\\" said Courtney Clark, Caffall's sister, reached Monday evening at her mother's home in Navasota, about 20 miles to the south. \\"We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused. We're shocked.\\" Police spokeswoman Rhonda Seaton said Chris Northcliff was outside the home when he was shot, as was the wounded woman, whose name had not been released by Monday evening. The woman was hospitalized in serious condition following surgery. One of the injured officers, Justin Oehlkee, was treated for a gunshot wound in the calf and was in stable condition, Seaton said. Two other officers -- Brad Smith and Phil Dorsett, were treated for \\"shrapnel injuries\\" and released, Seaton said. Police declined to speculate on a motive for the gunfire. The shootings prompted Texas A&M to issue an emergency alert warning students and residents to stay away from the area. Most of the university's 50,000 students were not on the campus about 90 miles northwest of Houston because the fall semester doesn't start until Aug. 27, university spokeswoman Sherylon Carroll said. Diana Harbourt, 27, who lives about a block from where the shootings happened, said she heard five loud popping sounds from a back room of her home looking out her front door to see an officer park his vehicle on the street and crouch in front of another vehicle. \\"We heard him exchanging some words with the person and then shots being fired,\\" Harbourt said. \\"And then we heard more sirens and more officers and fire trucks came and they were keeping their distance, kind of slowly moving in. More officers showed up and told us to stay inside.\\" Officers, meanwhile, were dealing with losing someone McCollum called a respected colleague. \\"Brian Bachmann was very close to everyone in law enforcement,\\" McCollum said. \\"He was a pillar in this community, and it's sad and tragic that we've lost him today.\\" Bachmann worked more than 19 years in law enforcement, according to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education. He started out with the Hempstead Police Department before spending most of his career with the Brazos County Sheriff's Office. He had been a constable since January 2011, after winning election to the post the prior November. In a February 2010 candidate profile in the Bryan-College Station Eagle, the married father of two said he wanted to bring \\"constables back to the community\\" by actively patrolling neighborhoods to discourage crime. Constables are law enforcement officers similar to sheriff's deputies who are elected to serve in specific county precincts. They primarily serve warrants and official paperwork or act as courtroom bailiffs. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an A&M alumnus, said at an event in Florida that his \\"prayers are with any of those that have been injured.\\" A&M President R.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When we dive into the world of quantum mechanics, we're faced with a fascinating but highly unusual set of rules governing the behavior of subatomic particles. One of these fundamental principles is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which asserts that it is impossible to measure precisely both the position and the momentum (mass times velocity) of a particle at the same time. This intrinsic uncertainty is not due to the limitations of our measurement instruments or techniques; rather, it is an inherent property of the subatomic world. In other words, the more accurately we try to pin down a particle's position, the less certain we become about its momentum, and vice versa. This is because particles at the quantum level exhibit wave-particle duality – they can be described as both particles and waves simultaneously. The uncertainty principle was formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 and is expressed mathematically as: Δx * Δp ≥ h/ (4π), where Δx and Δp are the uncertainties in position and momentum, respectively, and h is Planck's constant. The principle signifies that there is a limit to the product of these uncertainties, meaning we can never make them both arbitrarily small. An experiment that displays this principle is the double-slit experiment, in which particles such as electrons or photons are directed at a barrier with two slits. When both slits are open, the particles create an interference pattern on a screen behind the barrier, demonstrating their wave-like properties. However, if we attempt to measure which slit the particle went through (thereby determining the particle's position more exactly), the interference pattern disappears – indicating that the particle's wave-like behavior has been lost in favor of its particle nature. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell the exact position and velocity of a subatomic particle simultaneously due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that outlines the inherent limitations in our ability to know both quantities with complete precision."},{"instruction":"What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"Example of a Negative Review: Title: Extremely Disappointed in XYZ Hotel – Not Worth the Hype Rating: 1 out of 5 stars Reviewed by: UnhappyTraveler Date of Stay: July 16 – July 20, 2021 I chose to stay at XYZ Hotel for my annual family vacation based on its rave reviews and supposedly exceptional amenities. Unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant, and I feel like I wasted my money staying here. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues faced during our stay: 1. Check-in Process: Our check-in time was supposed to be at 3:00 PM. However, we were not able to get into our room until 4:45 PM due to some \\"housekeeping delays.\\" While the front desk staff apologized, they offered no remedies for the inconvenience caused to us. 2. Room Condition: Upon finally entering our room, we found it to be in poor condition. Not only was the room poorly cleaned (we found several strands of hair on the bed and a mysterious stain on the carpet), but the furniture was also damaged, with chipping paint and scratches on the surfaces. 3. WiFi: One of the reasons we chose XYZ Hotel was because they advertised free, high-speed WiFi. Unfortunately, the WiFi was painfully slow and kept disconnecting throughout our stay. When we contacted the front desk, they said they were aware of the issue but seemed disinterested in helping us with the problem. 4. Noise Level: The walls seemed paper-thin in this hotel. We could hear our neighbors' conversations, their television programs, and even their middle-of-the-night bathroom visits. This made it difficult to get a good night's rest, and I never expected such disturbances in a supposedly upscale hotel. 5. Customer Service: When I brought our concerns to the attention of the hotel staff, they didn't seem to care and only offered vague apologies. We were not compensated in any way for the various issues we faced during our stay. 6. Amenities: While the hotel's website boasted a heated pool, modern gym, and an on-site restaurant, many of these amenities did not live up to the expectation. The pool was closed, the gym equipment was outdated, and the restaurant offered a limited menu with subpar food quality. In conclusion, our stay at XYZ Hotel was a grave disappointment. Due to the lack of attention to detail, poor customer service, and failure to deliver on promised amenities, I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone in the future. My family and I felt misled by the enticing online presentation of this hotel, which in reality, was a lackluster and uncomfortable experience."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Estos se adhieren entre sí mucho más que al yugo de hierro.

Within the wine industry, there are several cuvées that may be made as kosher wines. Kosher wines adhere to strict guidelines and laws in order to be considered kosher, ensuring they are suitable for consumption by those who follow Jewish dietary laws, known as Kashrut. To begin with, in order to produce a kosher cuvée, the vineyard must be carefully managed, with vines being at least four years old before their grapes can be used. Furthermore, every seventh year, the vineyard must lay fallow – a detail known as \\"Shmita.\\" The actual winemaking process for kosher cuvées is also quite meticulous. Only Sabbath-observant Jews are allowed to physically handle the wine and must ensure that all the winemaking equipment is properly cleaned and sanitized in accordance with kosher laws. Kosher cuvées must also be made with certain approved ingredients. For example, fining agents, which are used to clarify wine, must be derived from kosher sources. Typical fining agents like isinglass (derived from fish) and casein (derived from milk) are generally not used in kosher wines. Instead, alternatives like bentonite clay are employed. Taking all of these factors into account, there are a few types of cuvées that can be considered kosher: 1. Kosher Chardonnay: Many Chardonnay producers have created kosher cuvées using the same traditional techniques as non-kosher Chardonnays. These wines display the classic Chardonnay characteristics, such as notes of apple, pear, and citrus along with oaky flavors from barrel aging. 2. Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon: As one of the most popular wine varieties, it is not surprising that there are kosher Cabernet Sauvignon cuvées as well. These wines exhibit typical Cabernet flavors, like blackcurrant and plum, as well as herbaceous and spicy notes. 3. Kosher Merlot: Merlot lends itself well to kosher production, as it can be crafted into a versatile, easy-drinking wine. Many kosher Merlots showcase flavors of red fruits, chocolate, and vanilla with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. 4. Kosher Rosé: With the increasing interest in rosé wines, there is a growing selection of kosher rosé cuvées. These are often delicate, showcasing flavors of strawberries, raspberries, and rose petals. 5. Kosher Sparkling Wines: Sparkling wines, including champagne, can also be made in kosher variants. The same methods used to create non-kosher sparkling wines (e.g., Méthode Champenoise) are used for kosher sparkling cuvées, ensuring high-quality bubbly for those looking to enjoy a festive treat. In conclusion, there are several cuvées that might be made as kosher, adhering to the strict guidelines of Jewish dietary laws. The production methods for kosher wines ensure a high standard of quality, allowing wine enthusiasts to enjoy a variety of kosher options across different blends and styles."},{"instruction":"Is the premise \\"A woman next to a subway entrance in a tan coat is asking a woman in a pink coat directions.\\" true if \\"Two people quietly relax on the beach.\\"?","output":"To determine if the premise \\"A woman next to a subway entrance in a tan coat is asking a woman in a pink coat directions.\\" is true given the statement \\"Two people quietly relax on the beach.\\", I will follow these steps: 1.

This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom.

In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions.

A semi truck pulling several fuel tankers drives by, followed by a black Buick GNX containing Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) and two older pickup trucks. Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch. Letty gets knocked off of her feet but hangs on, though her hammer falls. While driving alongside of her, Dom orders Letty to spray the hitch, despite her no longer having a hammer. He instead pulls a 180-degree turn with the rear end of his car hitting the tanker, which shatters the frozen hitch, though he is now driving in reverse.

Fossella, a Staten Island native, was born to a family that included several politicians. Fossella initially took office in 1997, after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari. As a result of a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, followed by the public disclosure a week later that he had had an affair with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, that had resulted in a three-year-old child while Fossella was married, he announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election. Before Fossella announced that he would not run in 2008, he was included in the National Republican Congressional Committee's list of Republican candidates who qualified for fundraising help because they were thought to be particularly vulnerable. Steve Harrison hoped to run against Fossella again in the 2008 election, but New York City Council member Domenic Recchia also began seeking the Democratic nomination.

Choices: - crystalline - spherical - concave - convex A: Answer:","output":"Telescopes use convex lenses to enlarge images."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Duvets come in twin, full, queen, and king sizes, so pick a size that corresponds to your mattress size. If you want the duvet to hang over the sides a little more, or you’re really tall, you might consider getting the next size up. The ticking, or the outer part of the duvet, is what holds the filling and is usually made of 100% cotton. It’s important to look at the thread count of the ticking, especially if buying a down or feather duvet. The higher the thread count, the tighter the fabric is woven, meaning it will be much harder for feathers to escape. Buying a duvet made of cotton ticking, or cotton-polyester, ensures your duvet is super breathable. Aim for a thread count of 200 or more. To keep the filling spread out, sewn through box construction has both sides of the duvet sewn together to create boxes. While this keeps the filling in place, it also doesn't allow filling to reach the edges of each box, making it less warm. In a baffle box structure, small walls are built between each square so that the filling remains spread out while still retaining its warmth. In this construction, there aren't any cold spots. Baffle box construction is more expensive than sewn through box construction due to its more intricate structure. Since duvets aren't easily cleaned, choosing a cover for your duvet will help protect it and make the cleaning process much easier. Duvet covers come in many different materials and styles, allowing you to choose one that matches your bedroom or personal preferences. Duvet covers are less expensive than regular duvets, making them an affordable option. The covers attach to the duvet with zippers, buttons, or ties.

But considering the scale of the abuses that the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee revealed on Tuesday in its report on CIA torture, one might have expected a bit more outrage from the leaders of the Old World. Instead, the most common reaction was to praise the report as a sign of American transparency and accountability—two of the values meant to bind the West together—while many European statesmen have so far avoided saying anything at all. That includes the leaders of France and Germany, who made no public reaction in the 24 hours that followed the report’s release. British Prime Minister David Cameron only mentioned it while on a visit to Turkey on Wednesday when a reporter asked him for a response. “I’m satisfied that our system is dealing with all of these issues,” Cameron said. The practice of torture, he confidently added, is “wrong.” The most prominent sign of European contrition came from Poland, whose former President finally admitted during a press conference on Wednesday that his country hosted one of the CIA’s “black sites,” or secret prisons, where the abuse of detainees occurred. The U.S. had asked Poland “to find a quiet place, where effective measures could be taken to obtain information,” said Alexander Kwasniewski, who served as President from 1995 to 2005. Poland had consented to the request, he added, without knowing that the “quiet place” could be used for torture. He did not clarify the year when the facility was shut down. But the prevailing sentiment among Europe-watchers was that these revelations were considered old news. “All of this was ten years ago,” explains Constanze Stelzenmueller, an expert on European politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. “What’s striking is that the Americans are now really trying to do a reasonably honest and non-partisan accounting of what happened.” That American admission of guilt, and the integrity it required, did not go unnoticed even in some of the most damning editorials published in the mainstream European press. “The United States makes mistakes, sometimes terrible ones,” read an editorial in Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading newsmagazine. “But it has the strength to acknowledge it and learn from it.” The muted reaction from European leaders, says Stelzenmueller, is perhaps best explained by the dilemma this issue presents. If one of them praises the report’s transparency, they could be perceived as downplaying the gravity of the crimes committed in the execution of the war on terror. If one of them condemns those crimes, they will almost certainly face questions about their own country’s complicity, if not also its direct involvement, in torture and illegal detention. “The risk of the follow-up question is in any case greater than the political gains,” Stelzenmueller says. But that did not stop some European politicians from using the report as political ammunition. In Germany, the co-chairman of the opposition Left Party, Bernd Riexinger, called for Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to resign over the revelations. He also demanded Berlin rethink its cooperation with the U.S. on matters of intelligence. “I see no basis for cooperation with torturers,” Riexinger, whose party controls about 10% of the seats in the German parliament, told the Handelsblatt newspaper. The Foreign Minister, who also held the position from 2005 to 2009, did not deign to respond to the remarks, though he did issue one of the harsher condemnations against the CIA’s torture practices to issue from the European leadership. “What was then considered right and done in the fight against Islamic terrorism was unacceptable and a serious mistake,” Steinmeier told the German daily Bild, adding that the CIA’s activities amounted to a “gross violation of our liberal, democratic values.” But experts still saw no real chance of the report forcing Berlin or any other major European power to question their transatlantic ties. The reason, says Joerg Forbrig, an expert on Central and Eastern Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, has to do with the ongoing standoff with Russia over Ukraine, which has urged the West to band together against what they perceive as a common threat to their security. “The key ingredient to any successful Russia policy is Western unity,” he says. And as German Chancellor Angela Merkel pursues an ever tougher line against Moscow, “She needs to rally the Europeans, and she needs to make sure the coordination with the Americans remains intact.” So if the White House was expecting the Senate report to freeze relations across the Atlantic, it can probably breathe a sigh of relief.

Many people thought that European leaders would be upset about this news. However, most of the leaders either praised the report for being honest or didn't say anything about it at all. The president of Poland admitted that his country helped the CIA by providing a secret place for them to work, but he didn't know they would use it for torture. Some politicians in Europe used the report to criticize others, but there isn't expected to be any big changes in the relationships between Europe and the United States because of the report."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is Neil Broderick writing a book about? is inside the article: A man unveils a valuable painting he picked up for 50,000 and is killed. A card with a large black ace (of spades) is put on his chest. Another \\"Black Ace\\" victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace.

The general rule for lure color is \\"bright day, light colors; dark day, dark colors.\\" On bright, sunny days and in clear water conditions, choose lures that are light in color and mimic natural patterns. On cloudy days and in dirty water conditions, choose darker lures and those with a non-natural coloration, preferably types that make noise or vibrate as they move through the water. A notable exception to this rule is the use of 2-toned plastic worms that feature a darker head color and a fluorescent pink or yellow tail color. Many anglers use plastic worms colored like this when fishing in cloudy water conditions. In general, choose smaller jigs and grubs when fishing for panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie, perch) and larger lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits when fishing for bigger fish (bass, walleye, and pike). Smaller lures are best suited for light and ultralight spinning and spincasting tackle (or fly rods in the case of dry and wet flies) with lines of 4 to 10-pound test (2 to 5 kg class), while larger lures are meant to be fished with medium to heavy action rods, spinning or baitcasting reels, and lines of 12 to 20-pound test (6 to 10 kg class) or better. (Lures used to fish for muskellunge, the largest member of the pike family, are decidedly larger than those used for bass, walleye, and northern pike, and often require the use of a wire leader because of the muskie's sharp teeth.) Lure size can also be dictated by weather conditions and how fish react to them. In early spring, or when cold front conditions clear the skies and cool the water to make fish lethargic, smaller lures are usually better choices than larger lures. (Lures used for ice fishing are exceptionally tiny, usually grub jigs or small spoons.) In high-wind conditions, you may need to use a larger lure simply to have enough resistance on the end of the line to keep the wind from bowing it so that you can't detect if fish are hitting the lure. Also try casting out a spinner and just keep casting and retrieving the lure.","output":"Choose light-colored lures on bright days and in clear water, and darker, noisier ones in murky conditions or on cloudy days, adjusting size based on target fish and weather conditions."},{"instruction":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Take the fabric and fold it over the sides of the headliner. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the excess fabric. Leave a little bit so you can wrap it over the edge and attach it so the material is more secure on the panel. Do another round of smoothing with your hands to get the material as flat and even as possible. Try to match the overlapping of the original headliner fabric, if possible. Spray the adhesive onto the edge of the panel and the 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric that’s left after you trimmed the material. Fold the fabric so it wraps over the side of the panel. Use your hands to smooth it out. Don’t pull or stretch the fabric or it can form air pockets between the fabric and the board. The folded bit of fabric will allow the material to stay better attached to the board. Use a utility knife or razor blade to trim the fabric covering the holes where the accessories, such as a light or a mirror, were inserted. Cut the fabric so it’s flush against the edge and there isn’t any excess material hanging over the side.

The full coalition will be needed, according to Obama. \\"We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected.\\" The meeting Tuesday was chaired by General Martin Dempsey, U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with General Lloyd Austin, commanding general of the U.S. Central Command which is largely running the operations in both Iraq and Syria. President Obama attended for a portion near the end of the day at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, DC. Iraqi military officials were expected to attend. Syrian opposition members were not invited because the meeting is for \\"sovereign nations\\" only, the official said. Classified discussions are expected to take place on the current operations. There was expected, however, to be some discussion of arming and training moderate Syrian opposition forces. ISIS militants march on despite airstrikes, international outrage. It was not expected that the coalition defense chiefs would discuss some significant change in strategy, the official said before the meetings got underway. \\"This meeting is to share our vision, discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead.\\" The defense chiefs are not policymakers, so any significant changes in the mission would require a decision by governments on a political level. This is the fourth such meeting of coalition partners, but the largest gathering to date. Similar meetings have been held in recent months in Jordan, Paris and Bonn. The military operation against ISIS now does have a name but the Pentagon is not expected to reveal it until later this week, a U.S. military official confirms to CNN. The name will not be made public until a formal 'execution order' covering the entire mission against ISIS is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Naming the operation is a fairly bureaucratic matter, but it is typically done in large scale or significant military operations as a means of providing a mechanism for everything from budgeting of funds to awarding of medals. The execution order will spell out these details, as well as potential command arrangements, and a formal military definition of the mission. Related: Pentagon to release ISIS codename.

He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood. Which parent was at a lower risk of developing atherosclerosis? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Mary, Bob's mom, is at a lower risk of developing atherosclerosis. To justify this conclusion, let's analyze the situation step by step.

And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes.

Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. Start with the given equation: -420 = -176*s + 1868 2. We want to isolate s, so we need to move the constants (numbers without variables) to the opposite side of the equation. To do this, subtract 1868 from both sides of the equation: -420 - 1868 = -176*s + 1868 - 1868 3. Perform the subtraction from step 2: -2288 = -176*s 4. Now, we want to get s by itself.

Plot: The story follows Elisa, a mute janitor working at a top-secret government facility where the creature, referred to as \\"the Asset,\\" has been brought from the depths of the Amazon rainforest for study and potential exploitation. Both the creature and Elisa are seen as outcasts in their respective worlds, making their connection feel incredibly genuine. The film delves into themes of loneliness, prejudice, and the universal need for love and understanding. Performances: Sally Hawkins delivers an extraordinary performance as Elisa, bringing to life her character's isolation and longing for connection without uttering a single word. Her use of sign language and emotive facial expressions creates a powerfully compelling character that carries the weight of the film. Doug Jones, who is no stranger to investing himself in unusual roles, brings the amphibious creature to life through a combination of prosthetics, makeup, and his unique ability to truly embody the character. Through subtle movements and body language, Jones instills the creature with a sense of wonder, vulnerability, and an emotional depth that reaches beyond words. Michael Shannon, as the villainous government agent, Strickland, embodies the heart of darkness that seeks to control and destroy what it does not understand. His portrayal is chilling and serves as a stark contrast to the tender relationship between Elisa and the creature. Supporting actors Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, as Elisa's confidants, provide much-needed levity and warmth amid the unfolding drama. Visuals and Sound: \\"The Shape of Water\\" boasts stunning visuals that reflect its fantastical elements and poetic undertones. Cinematographer Dan Laustsen employs a dreamy, timeless palette of blues, greens, and golds that bring the story to life in a visually rich way. The creature's design, a blend of mythical and zoological features, underscores its status as both an otherworldly being and a living, breathing part of our world. Alexandre Desplat's whimsical score ties everything together, weaving a sense of magic and wonder throughout the film, underscoring both heartrending and intimate moments. The soundtrack expertly combines elements of classical music, jazz, and atmospheric sounds that mirror the onscreen blend of fantasy and reality. Conclusion: Guillermo del Toro's \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a triumph in storytelling, embracing the power of love, empathy, and understanding to bridge the divide between different worlds. Bolstered by remarkable performances and an enchanting visual style, the film is a testament to the power of cinema to convey universal truths through stories that defy categorization. With its distinct blend of romance, fantasy, and horror, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a mesmerizing and irresistible tale that should not be missed."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Lily Stanler (Nicholle Tom) works as a claims analyst for an insurance company in Philadelphia.

A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the British... answer the following question: What war did the Victory Loan campaign make an effort to raise money for by organizing If Day?

In his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece, will Tom Brady join the likes of Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana in winning four rings, or will Seattle make it back-to-back victories? Here is our ultimate A to Z list ahead of this Sunday's blockbuster in Arizona. Arizona Hosts its third Super Bowl on Sunday. The Patriots have unfinished business in the Grand Canyon State after being denied a perfect season by Eli Manning’s unfancied New York Giants (and David Tyree’s infamous helmet catch) seven years ago. In other news, the Dallas Cowboys won their third title in four years with a 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Tempe in 1996. Marshawn Lynch may not talk to the media, but his rumblings on the field are as loud as anything in the","output":"NFL. The Seahawks' powerful running back, nicknamed \\"Beast Mode,\\" played a pivotal role in the team's Super Bowl triumph last year and has been instrumental in their return to the big stage. Lynch finished the regular season with 1,306 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns, making him a nightmare matchup for opposing defenses. Will the Patriots be able to contain his explosive runs and powerful stiff arms, or will Lynch have another big game on the biggest stage? New England Patriots' high-powered passing offense is spearheaded by future Hall-of-Fame quarterback Tom Brady, who, at age 37, continues to play at an elite level. Brady threw for 4,109 yards and 33 touchdowns during the regular season, relying heavily on the versatile talents of tight end Rob Gronkowski, who amassed 1,124 yards and 12 touchdowns himself. The duo will face a stiff challenge from Seattle's vaunted \\"Legion of Boom\\" secondary, featuring the likes of Pro-Bowl cornerback Richard Sherman and hard-hitting safety Kam Chancellor. This compelling battle between New England's potent passing game and Seattle's suffocating pass defense will be a key factor in determining the outcome of the game. One cannot discuss the Seahawks without mentioning their dynamic, play-making quarterback Russell Wilson. The third-year pro has a 42-13 career record, including playoffs, and has already established himself as one of the league's premier quarterbacks. Although he does not boast eye-popping statistics like some of his peers, Wilson's uncanny ability to extend plays with his legs and deliver pinpoint passes when they matter most makes him a constant threat. He will need to be at his improvisational best to keep the Patriots' underrated defense off balance. Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick is no stranger to success, having guided his team to six Super Bowl appearances during his 15-year tenure. Renowned for his strategic prowess and ability to make in-game adjustments, Belichick will be tested by Seattle's punishing ground game and swarming pass rush. Meanwhile, Pete Carroll, the architect of the Seahawks' recent ascent to prominence, will be aiming to cement his own legacy by becoming the first head coach to win back-to-back titles since Belichick himself. Over the years, special teams play has proven to be of paramount importance in the Super Bowl. Field position, field goal accuracy, and game-breaking returns can all swing momentum in an instant. Both teams possess reliable kickers – New England's Stephen Gostkowski and Seattle's Steven Hauschka – who have been clutch performers in high-pressure situations. Additionally, Seattle's Tyler Lockett and New England's Julian Edelman are both dynamic punt returners capable of swinging the field position battle in their team's favor. With both teams relatively healthy entering the game, injuries should not play a significant role in the outcome of Super Bowl XLIX. However, nagging ailments, such as the elbow injury that plagued Patriots' cornerback Brandon Browner late in the season, could potentially resurface and impact individual performances. In conclusion, Super Bowl XLIX promises to be a fascinating and closely contested encounter between the Seattle Seahawks, seeking to establish themselves as a modern-day dynasty, and the New England Patriots, looking to cement their own legacy following a decade of dominance. Tom Brady's quest for a fourth ring, and Russell Wilson's pursuit of back-to-back championships, adds a fascinating subplot to a game that is already brimming with intriguing storylines. Fans around the globe will be watching with bated breath to see which team emerges as the NFL's ultimate champion."},{"instruction":"Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

This is because the majority of those sales in 1954–55 were to the \\"hillbilly\\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

On the field, the pair will bring a wealth of experience and quality to the team, helping to raise the overall level of performance. Off the pitch, the signings demonstrate a clear statement of intent from the club to continue its push for promotion. 2. James Caton: A talented winger with a point to prove James Caton, the skillful winger, is no stranger to success on the football field. Having previously plied his trade with clubs like Shrewsbury Town, Lincoln City, and Wrexham, Caton boasts a wealth of experience across various levels of English football, making him a valuable addition to Southport's attacking arsenal. The winger will be keen to hit the ground running and prove his worth in the National League, with the hopes of contributing greatly to Southport's promotion push. Fans can expect an attacking flair from Caton, who is known for his ability to dribble past defenders and deliver precise crosses into the box. 3. Joe Kearns: A solid and versatile defender In Joe Kearns, Southport has acquired a solid defender capable of playing in various positions across the backline. With stints at clubs like Salford City and Alfreton Town, Kearns has demonstrated his ability to operate at this level effectively. The defender's versatility will be invaluable to Southport, providing manager Liam Watson with a range of options when it comes to defensive selections.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:41 EST, 9 May 2013. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia. This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing. The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around 1.5million. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant has accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home. He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off. Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career. In return, Pamela Bryant received a 450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada. However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia. Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported. 'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote. According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false. statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said. to her, \\"Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the. memorabilia.\\" 'Her response. was, \\"Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either.\\" Of course, this is. untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia. several years earlier.' Last. week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the. scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for. the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection. Mr. Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not. his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing. that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block. without their permission, and then refused to return the prized. possessions. Bryant said in. a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute go back. to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he. was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’ to his. children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop. Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale. Vanessa. Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when. confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme,. but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to. a storage facility. Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden. The disagreement is a high-value,. high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid. of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of 1.5 million. Among. the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's. jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School;. varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995. Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA. championship game. And. then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school. championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the. 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According. to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin. Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus. Wagner baseball card for a record 2.1 million. In its court filings, Goldin says. Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years. ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela. Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in. them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a. 1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell. Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles. Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of 1.5 million. The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced 450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's break down each sentence and compare the information provided in both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket\\" This sentence states that the speaker lived in a little town called Newmarket. Sentence 2: \\"I lived in Newmarket which had 3000 residents.\\" This sentence states that the speaker lived in Newmarket and provides additional information that the town had 3000 residents. Step 1: Comparing the information about living in Newmarket. Both sentences mention that the speaker lived in Newmarket. Step 2: Comparing the additional information. Sentence 1 does not mention the number of residents in the town. However, Sentence 2 provides information about 3000 residents in Newmarket. Based on the comparison, the information about living in Newmarket is consistent in both sentences, but the second sentence provides additional details that are not present in the first sentence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the second sentence is entirely entailed by the first sentence, but it does support part of the first sentence (i.e., living in Newmarket)."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of Westinghouse, Tyco, and others) tried and failed to emulate GE's success.[citation needed]\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Besides ITT Corporation, which two companies tried to emulate GE, but failed by the mid-1980's?\\"","output":"The sentence provided does not give a valid answer to the question, \\"Besides ITT Corporation, which two companies tried to emulate GE, but failed by the mid-1980s?\\" The sentence states that the first wave of conglomerates, which includes ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, and others, fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s. From this information, we can infer that these first-wave conglomerates tried to emulate GE's success but faced difficulties. However, the sentence then mentions that a second wave of conglomerates—including Westinghouse, Tyco, and others—tried and failed to emulate GE's success in the late 1990s. This part of the sentence does not directly address the question because it is discussing the failures of the late 1990s rather than the mid-1980s. Furthermore, the sentence does not clearly specify which of the first-wave conglomerates directly sought to emulate GE, only that they fell by the wayside around the same period. To answer the question, more information would be needed to determine the specific two companies, aside from ITT Corporation, that tried to emulate GE's success but failed by the mid-1980s. It is important to note that Ling-Temco-Vought and Tenneco were mentioned in the sentence as part of the first wave of conglomerates that fell by the wayside during that period; however, this statement does not explicitly confirm that they aimed to emulate GE and failed.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Article: He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. He is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. He's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \\"SEALs Team 6\\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. He was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \\"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \\"It's getting very scientific.\\" Marcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \\"He'll be ripped,\\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \\"Rogue Warrior.\\"\\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength.

In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission.

Here is a detailed account of each of their Super Bowl victories: 1. Super Bowl XXXII (January 25, 1998): Denver Broncos vs. Green Bay Packers In Super Bowl XXXII, the Denver Broncos, led by quarterback John Elway and head coach Mike Shanahan, defeated the defending champions Green Bay Packers. The game was played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. The Broncos won with a score of 31-24, ending a 13-year Super Bowl winning streak for the NFC conference. Denver's running back Terrell Davis was named Super Bowl MVP, finishing the game with 157 rushing yards, 3 touchdowns, and overcoming a migraine that had temporarily obstructed his vision during the game. 2. Super Bowl XXXIII (January 31, 1999): Denver Broncos vs. Atlanta Falcons Following their victory in Super Bowl XXXII, the Denver Broncos returned to the championship game in Super Bowl XXXIII, this time against the Atlanta Falcons. The game took place at the Pro Player Stadium in Miami, Florida. Denver successfully defended their title, winning 34-19 and completing back-to-back championship wins. Quarterback John Elway, in his final season with the team, was named Super Bowl MVP, throwing for 336 yards, 1 passing touchdown, and scoring 1 rushing touchdown. This victory solidified the Broncos' place as one of the dominant teams of the 1990s. 3. Super Bowl 50 (February 7, 2016): Denver Broncos vs. Carolina Panthers The Denver Broncos won their third Super Bowl title in Super Bowl 50, played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. This time, the team faced off against the Carolina Panthers, who had the league's best regular-season record at 15-1. The Broncos' defense, led by linebacker and eventual Super Bowl MVP Von Miller, stifled the Panthers' high-scoring offense and forced quarterback Cam Newton to commit multiple turnovers. The final score of the game was 24-10 in favor of Denver. This win marked the end of quarterback Peyton Manning's illustrious career, as he retired shortly after this victory. In summary, the Denver Broncos have defeated the Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons, and Carolina Panthers in their three Super Bowl victories."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: how is Tristram of Lyonesse and William Morris related? A:","output":"Tristram of Lyonesse is a legendary Cornish hero and one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. His story, along with his tragic love affair with Isolde, has been the subject of various works of literature, music, and art. William Morris was an influential British designer, poet, and socialist activist during the 19th century, known for his contribution to the Arts and Crafts Movement and his rich catalog of literary works. The relation between Tristram of Lyonesse and William Morris lies in the fact that Morris, as a poet and writer, was deeply inspired by medieval themes and the Arthurian romance. He produced a number of literary works based on these themes, including his epic poem \\"The Defence of Guenevere,\\" published in 1858, and \\"The Life and Death of Jason,\\" published in 1867. Although he did not write a specific work centered on Tristram of Lyonesse, his fascination with and use of themes from Arthurian legend and medieval history connects him to the story of Tristram. Furthermore, William Morris's role in advancing the appreciation and revival of medieval art and literature also contributed to the continued interest in Arthurian legends and figures like Tristram of Lyonesse. Through his work in design, poetry, and his active involvement in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Morris helped bring attention back to the myths and legends from the Middle Ages, indirectly influencing the perception and understanding of Tristram among 19th-century audiences and beyond."},{"instruction":"Dual-role transvestism is the formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to describe people who wear clothes of the opposite sex to experience being the opposite sex temporarily, but don't have a sexual motive or want gender reassignment surgery.

Step 3: Provide a specific answer Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1653, marking the beginning of the period known as The Protectorate. Step 4: Further explanation The Protectorate was the period during the Commonwealth (or, to monarchists, the Interregnum) when England (which at that time included Wales), Ireland and Scotland were governed by a Lord Protector. The Protectorate began in 1653 when, following the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and then Barebone's Parliament, Oliver Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth under the terms of the Instrument of Government.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: First, let's consider the fact that the human body is made of approximately 60% water, highlighting the importance of water in our physical makeup. Without water, our bodies would not have the proper medium for the transportation of nutrients and waste, making it crucial for our daily functioning. Furthermore, water plays a vital role in digestion and absorption of nutrients. It actively participates in breaking down food in our stomach, allowing essential nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Without water, digestion would be compromised, leading to malnutrition and other related health issues. In addition, water helps to regulate our body temperature through sweating and respiration. By evaporating from our skin surface, water helps in dissipating excess heat and maintaining a constant internal temperature, which is essential for our survival. Moreover, water serves as a lubricant for our joints, helping to reduce friction and wear, thus ensuring smooth movement and minimizing the risk of joint pain or injury. Similarly, water is crucial for the proper functioning of our eyes and mouth, as it helps to keep these areas moist and nourished. Finally, staying properly hydrated is associated with better cognitive function and reduced fatigue. Our brain requires adequate hydration to function optimally, as even mild dehydration can negatively impact cognitive abilities such as focus, concentration, and memory. Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that water is absolutely essential for our daily lives and overall well-being. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Is water important for our daily lives and overall well-being?\\" is a resounding yes."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Step-by-step reasoning process: Alfred Russel Wallace has become famous for developing his theory of evolution contemporaneously with Darwin. The question and answer:","output":"Question: How did Alfred Russel Wallace become famous alongside Charles Darwin for the development of the theory of evolution, and how did their contributions intersect? Answer: Alfred Russel Wallace became famous alongside Charles Darwin due to his independent conception of the theory of evolution by natural selection. The step-by-step reasoning process for the intersection of their work is as follows: 1. Both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were highly respected naturalists and biologists during the 19th century. 2. Darwin had been developing his ideas about evolution for many years. However, he was hesitant about publishing them due to the controversy surrounding the subject at that time. 3. In 1858, Wallace, while working in the Malay Archipelago, wrote an essay titled \\"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type.\\" In this essay, he outlined his theory of evolution by natural selection, which was strikingly similar to Darwin's ideas. 4. Wallace sent his essay to Darwin, seeking his opinion. Recognizing the similarities between Wallace's ideas and his own unpublished work, Darwin decided that the time was right to publicize his own ideas as well. 5. Darwin reached out to his friends Sir Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker, who arranged for a joint reading of both Darwin's and Wallace's works. They presented the joint papers on July 1, 1858, at the Linnean Society of London. 6. Following this event, Darwin published his famous work \\"On the Origin of Species\\" in 1859, elaborating on the theory of evolution by natural selection. 7. Although Darwin's work received more attention and recognition, Wallace's contribution to the theory of evolution was significant and groundbreaking as well. Wallace continued to contribute to the field of evolution throughout his life, and today he is recognized as co-discoverer of the theory. In conclusion, Alfred Russel Wallace became famous alongside Charles Darwin due to his independent development of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Their contributions intersected when Wallace shared his essay with Darwin, leading to a joint presentation of their work and the subsequent popularization of the theory."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

His mother was a housewife, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai). Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences. In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. His popularity has been attributed to \\"his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy\\". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even be taken in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him. Rajinikanth is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24 hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world. Much like Chuck Norris facts, \\"Rajinikanth facts\\" or \\"Rajinikanth jokes\\" are widely circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet. These satirical jokes have also inspired several mobile applications for iOS and Android. What is the most popular movie he has starred in?","output":"The article doesn't mention what the most popular movie Rajinikanth has starred in is.

The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in... contains an answer for the question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow?, what is it ?

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby.

Article: For hundreds Of years, scientists have been trying to answer what things have an effect on people's emotions . How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains. Through these ways, the weather can influence our emotions. Sadly, while the weather can change us, we can hardly change the weather. Question: What may be the best title for this passage?

The question and answer:","output":"Question: What could be other reasons for a man using a hay broom to sweep the ground besides preparing it for an upcoming event? Answer: There are several reasons why a man might use a hay broom to sweep the ground that are unrelated to preparing it for an event. These could include: 1. Regular maintenance: Sweeping the ground might be a part of his routine maintenance tasks to keep the area clean, well-groomed, and visually appealing. 2. Removing debris: The man could be using a hay broom to remove debris such as leaves, trash, or dirt from the ground to prevent it from accumulating and causing problems in the long term. 3. Safety: If the area is prone to accidents or slips due to loose material on the ground, the man might use a hay broom to sweep away any potential hazards, ultimately ensuring a safer environment for those who use the space. 4. Gardening purposes: In gardening, sweeping the ground can help in spreading seeds, leveling soil, or clearing pathways to ensure plants' healthy growth. 5. Pest control: Sweeping the ground could be a proactive measure for controlling pests by disrupting their habitats or making the environment less appealing for them to inhabit. In conclusion, using a hay broom to sweep the ground does not necessarily indicate that the man is preparing the area for an event.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: What did the narrator attempt to request of the doctor? === The answer to the above question is a). not enough information. b). an innocent request. c). to let them choose which arm to get the shot in. d). to give them the shot in the left arm.

Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes.

What does a person feel when they are close to their birthday? Options: - presents - eat every day - excited - expressive - compliments","output":"When a person is close to their birthday, they tend to feel: - Excited: Anticipation and excitement build up as someone approaches their birthday. This is because birthdays are often associated with celebrations, gatherings with friends and family, and a general sense of joy and happiness. People look forward to their birthday as it represents a milestone, and they might engage in various activities to mark the occasion. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. The first option, \\"presents,\\" is a noun and relates to what a person might receive on their birthday, not what they feel. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration. 2. The second option, \\"eat every day,\\" is not a feeling or emotion someone experiences in relation to their birthday. While there might be food involved in birthday celebrations, this does not explain the emotions a person feels when their birthday is near. So, this option can also be eliminated. 3. The third option, \\"excited,\\" is a valid choice as it represents an emotion people often experience when looking forward to their birthday or other special events. It's common for individuals to feel excited about what the day might bring, whether it be a celebration, time spent with loved ones, or other activities they have planned. 4. The fourth option, \\"expressive,\\" might be experienced by some people when they're close to their birthday, especially if they're excited about it. However, it may not be as universally applicable compared to the emotion of excitement. Therefore, it's not as strong of a choice as \\"excited\\". 5. The final option, \\"compliments,\\" is similar to \\"presents\\" in that it refers to something a person might receive, rather than what they feel. While compliments may be associated with birthdays, the option does not accurately describe the emotions a person feels in anticipation of their birthday. In summary, a person is likely to feel excited when they are close to their birthday. Though other emotions or experiences may also be present, the feeling of excitement is the most widely applicable and directly related to the anticipation of their special day."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"[A].\\" sentiment (Choices: [A]. negative; [B]. positive;).","output":"Step 1: Identify the sentiment choice The user has specified the sentiment as \\"[A]. negative\\"; therefore, I'll create a short movie review with a negative tone.

Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this.

Options: - to be heard - receive gifts - understand themselves - good things in life - acknowledgment Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"A person might go to get counseling for various reasons, including: 1. To be heard: Counseling provides a safe and non-judgmental environment for individuals to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It allows them to feel heard and understood by a trained professional who can offer guidance and support. 2. Understand themselves: Counseling can help individuals gain insight into their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. It allows individuals to explore their personal history, relationships, and any events that may be contributing to their current challenges. Through this self-examination, they can develop a better understanding of themselves and learn strategies for coping with and overcoming their struggles. 3. Acknowledgment: Counseling can validate and acknowledge an individual's feelings and experiences. This can be particularly helpful for individuals dealing with trauma, grief, or any other difficult life situations. By acknowledging their emotions and validating their experiences, individuals can begin the process of healing and growth. While the following options may not be primary reasons to seek counseling, they could be indirect benefits of the process: - Good things in life: Through the process of self-growth and understanding achieved in counseling, individuals may begin to appreciate and enjoy the positive aspects of their lives more fully. Counseling might help them develop a more balanced outlook and better coping strategies, which in turn may lead to experiencing more joy and satisfaction in daily life. - Receive gifts: Though not a direct outcome of counseling, individuals might feel more empowered, confident, and emotionally balanced as they progress in their therapeutic journey. In a sense, these can be seen as \\"gifts\\" that the person receives through their counseling experience.

Let the vinegar soak for 30 minutes. Scrub the container vigorously. Article:","output":"Title: \\"Efficient Cleaning Techniques: How to Remove Stains and Odors from Containers using Vinegar\\" Introduction At some point, we all face the issue of stubborn stains and lingering odors in our once cherished containers. Those leftover spaghetti sauce stains and unpleasant odors can be difficult to remove, and sometimes soap and water simply isn't enough. Thankfully, vinegar offers a natural and effective cleaning solution for ridding such stains and odors from containers. In this article, we will guide you step-by-step on how to use vinegar to clean your containers thoroughly, leaving them looking and smelling like new again. Step 1: Remove the Lid from the Container Begin by removing the lid from your container. This allows you to ensure both the container and its lid receive thorough cleaning and exposure to the vinegar. Additionally, removing the lid can help prevent the buildup of pressure inside the container during the soaking process. Step 2: Fill the Container with Vinegar Next, fill your container with vinegar. White vinegar is an excellent choice for cleaning purposes due to its acidity, which can effectively break down stains and remove odors. While other types of vinegar may also work, white vinegar is most commonly used for cleaning because of its mild scent and lower cost. You should fill the entire container with vinegar to ensure all surfaces and nooks are exposed to the cleaning power of the vinegar. Step 3: Let the Vinegar Soak for 30 Minutes After filling your container with vinegar, let it sit for 30 minutes. This soaking time allows the vinegar to penetrate deep into the stains and break down the substances causing the odors. The acidity of vinegar helps dissolve and lift away stubborn residues, while also neutralizing the bacteria responsible for the unpleasant smells. Step 4: Scrub the Container Vigorously Once the 30-minute soak is complete, it's time to scrub your container vigorously. Using a sponge or a brush with soft bristles, scrub the interior and exterior of the container to remove the loosened stains and residues. Don't forget to give the container's lid a thorough scrubbing to ensure it is free from any lingering residues or odors. Rinse and Dry After the scrubbing is complete, rinse the container thoroughly with water to remove any traces of vinegar and debris. You may also want to use a small amount of mild dish soap to aid in removing the vinegar scent. Finally, dry your container with a clean cloth or allow it to air dry. Conclusion By following these simple and effective steps, you can restore your stained and odor-filled containers to a clean and odor-free state. Not only is vinegar an affordable and natural cleaning solution, but it also helps minimize your reliance on chemical-based cleaning products. Say goodbye to stubborn stains and lingering odors with the power of vinegar's cleaning prowess."},{"instruction":"Egypt The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods.

Relations with China have also improved considerably. In 2014, Egypt and China have established a bilateral \\"comprehensive strategic partnership\\". Q: How many factories does Egyptian military have?","output":"The exact quantity of factories owned and operated by the Egyptian military is difficult to cite accurately due to the secretive nature of military operations and infrastructure. Additionally, the state often combines military and civilian production in these facilities. Nevertheless, it is known that they have dozens of factories. These factories don't just manufacture weapons but also consumer goods, which constitute a significant percentage of the Egyptian economy. The defence industry of Egypt is considered one of the oldest and most productive in the Middle East. These facilities produce various products and commodities ranging from heavy machinery, appliances, vehicles, and food products to the more expected military equipment and ammunition. In terms of military production, the factories produce a broad spectrum of equipment. This equipment ranges from conventional armaments like firearms and ammunition, to more complex weapon systems including armored vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels. As for military equipment, much of the manufacturing occurs under license from foreign countries. After the ousting of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the Egyptian military has been progressively replacing aging equipment from the former Soviet Union with modern US, French, and British equipment. A significant portion of these new systems, such as the M1 Abrams tank, are built domestically under license. Despite these advancements, Egypt has also been working tirelessly to bolster its military ties with other nations. There has been a noticeable improvement in military relations with countries like Russia and China since Mohamed Morsi's removal. These enhanced relationships have opened the door to increased military and trade ties, in addition to other aspects of bilateral cooperation. Given the lack of concrete figures on the number of military-owned factories in Egypt, it can be confirmed that the military industry in Egypt is advanced, diverse, and continually developing. This is due to their production expertise, prolific manufacturing, and close ties with military equipment suppliers worldwide."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"The period of Greek influence along the Nile is usually known as?\\" Context: \\"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year.

This process can develop their confidence, discipline, and problem-solving abilities. These personal attributes not only help individuals excel professionally but also contribute to increased satisfaction and happiness in their personal lives. 3. Career Advancement: By fostering a strong work ethic and continually striving for improvement, individuals can position themselves for career advancement opportunities. Hard work can help them gain recognition from supervisors and colleagues, demonstrating that they are ready for increased responsibilities and potentially higher-level positions. As a result, they may experience quicker career progression and a more fulfilling professional life. 4. Higher Sense of Achievement: A significant reason humans choose \\"better life\\" is the undeniable sense of accomplishment they feel when they witness the positive outcomes of their hard work. This sense of achievement can boost their self-esteem and overall satisfaction with life, further enhancing the quality of their existence. While some of the other options like \\"compliments acknowledgment,\\" \\"complimented,\\" and \\"American dream\\" can be partially related to a hard-working person's situation, they represent very specific aspects and do not encompass the broader range of potential benefits that a better life signifies. The \\"headache\\" option can be considered a side effect of overworking oneself or experiencing stress, but it doesn't define the overall improvement a person may achieve by working hard. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"better life\\" as the answer because it captures the essence of how hard work can lead to an improved life situation across multiple dimensions. This answer recognizes the potential for increased financial stability, personal growth, career advancement, and the intrinsic satisfaction of achievement, encompassing a holistic view of progress and life enhancement."},{"instruction":"A cougar is sleeping for 4 hours at night, and a zebra for 2 hours more. How much time do both animals sleep in one week? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"To determine the total sleep time for both animals in one week, we first need to calculate the total sleep time for each animal per day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. A cougar sleeps for 4 hours per night, while a zebra sleeps for 2 hours more than the cougar. Thus, the zebra sleeps for 4 hours (cougar's sleep time) + 2 hours = 6 hours per night. Now we can calculate the total sleep time per day for both animals combined: Cougar: 4 hours/night + Zebra: 6 hours/night = 10 hours/night To determine the total sleep time throughout a week (which consists of 7 days), we simply multiply the combined sleep time per day by the number of days in a week: 10 hours/night × 7 days = 70 hours Therefore, both the cougar and the zebra sleep for a combined total of 70 hours in one week."},{"instruction":"What happens next? How to identify an elm tree Examine the leaves of the tree. Elm leaves alternate along two sides of the stem.

First, we need to look at its leaves. When we say \\"leaves alternate along two sides of the stem,\\" it means that the leaves are not directly across from each other on the stem. Instead, they are in a zig-zag pattern like stairs. Now, let's talk about the shape of the leaf. They look like little ovals, kind of like an egg, but with a pointy part at the end. So, to find an elm tree, just look for these special leaves with their zig-zag pattern and oval shape! If you're still having trouble, you can always ask a grown-up for help or find a book about trees to look at pictures of the leaves. Happy tree searching!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"A: The last step of the process is the exhaust stroke, where the exhaust valve opens, and the combustion gases are expelled from the cylinder. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Fuel mixes with air: In the intake or induction stroke, fuel and air are mixed in the intake manifold. The fuel injectors spray fuel into the airstream, and the fuel droplets evaporate into the air to create a combustible mixture. 2. Mix gets inducted into cylinder: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves downward, drawing the fuel-air mixture into the cylinder. This is known as the intake or induction stroke. 3. Piston compresses the mix: The intake valve closes, and the piston rises in the cylinder. This action compresses the fuel-air mixture, increasing its pressure, temperature, and density. Compression allows the mix to ignite more easily and produce more power when ignited. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it, causing combustion: When the piston reaches the top of its compression stroke, the spark plug emits a high-energy spark that ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture. The instant of ignition is carefully timed to occur just before the piston reaches its highest point, known as top dead center (TDC). 5. Combustion gases expand: The rapid combustion of the fuel-air mixture generates high-pressure gases that expand and push the piston downward. This movement is known as the power stroke, and it produces the mechanical force that drives the engine. 6. Pushes piston during the power stroke: As the combustion gases push the piston downward, the connecting rod transfers the linear motion to the crankshaft, converting it into rotary motion. This rotary movement powers the vehicle’s wheels and various mechanical systems. 7. Exhaust stroke: The final step in the process is the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve opens as the piston begins to rise once more. The upward motion of the piston forces the spent combustion gases out of the cylinder and through the exhaust valve into the exhaust manifold. The exhaust gases then flow through the exhaust system, which may include a catalytic converter to reduce emissions and a muffler to reduce noise, before being released into the atmosphere. Once the exhaust gases are expelled, the exhaust valve closes, and the entire cycle repeats itself. In summary, the last step of the process is the exhaust stroke, where the exhaust valve opens, allowing the piston to expel spent combustion gases from the cylinder. This marks the completion of one engine cycle, and the process starts again with the intake or induction stroke."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two six graders learned about the lives of animals.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Flowers of War Context: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son,...

Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.

On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out. Will we meet the same end? Options: A Because the land is covered with water. B Because the light and heat form the sun cannot reach the earth. C Because people there cannot live at the temperature of zero. D Because wars break out among countries. Answer: B Because the light and heat form the sun cannot reach the earth.

The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David \\"Dai\\" Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. The Iveys were the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968. The band renamed themselves Badfinger and in 1969 Griffiths left and was replaced by Molland. In April 1970, while in the US scouting prospects for a tour, Collins was introduced to New York businessman, Stan Polley, who signed Badfinger to a business management contract in November 1970. Polley established Badfinger Enterprises, Inc., with Stan Poses as vice-president. This signed the band members to various contracts dictating that receipts of touring, recording, publishing and even songwriter performance royalties would then go into holding companies controlled by Polley. This led to a salary arrangement for the band, which various members later complained was inadequate in comparison to their gross earnings. Gibbins: \\"My first impression was, Stan [Polley] is a powerful guy\\", while Molland thought that Polley seemed more of a father-figure. At the same time, Polley was also managing Al Kooper, of Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Lou Christie. Although Polley's professional reputation was admired, his dubious financial practices eventually contributed to the band's downfall. A financial statement prepared by Polley's accountants, Sigmund Balaban & Co., for the period from 8 December 1970 to 31 October 1971, showed Polley's income from the band: \\"Salaries and advances to client, 8,339 (Joey Molland), 6,861 (Mike Gibbins), 6,211 (Tom Evans), 5,959 (Pete Ham). Net corporation profit, 24,569. Management commission, 75,744 (Stan Polley)\\". Although it is not known if the band members saw the statement, Collins certainly had, as his handwriting was on the document. Badfinger toured the US for three months in late 1970, and were generally well received, although the band were already weary of persistent comparisons to the Beatles. \\"The thing that impressed me so much was how similar their voices were to The Beatles\\", Tony Visconti (producer, \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\") said; \\"I sometimes had to look over the control board down into the studio to make sure John and Paul weren't singing lead vocals ...\\" Rolling Stone critic Mike Saunders opined in a rave review of No Dice in 1970: \\"It's as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger\\". Media comparisons between them and the Beatles would continue throughout Badfinger's career.","output":"This text is about the British rock band, Badfinger.

However, based on the options provided and the situation described, I will outline some possible explanations. I. She may mistake my truck as a pillar. It seems unlikely that she would mistake your truck for a stationary pillar, but it is possible that she did not recognize the size or position of your vehicle relative to her car. In such a case, she might not have realized that she was moving into your lane and cutting you off. II. None of the above choices. While none of the specific choices may apply in this instance, it is important to consider that there may be other factors at play that we are not aware of based on the information provided. III. She may not be paying attention to the traffic on the roadway. This seems like a plausible explanation, as the woman may have been distracted by something inside or outside her vehicle, or she could have simply been daydreaming or lost in thought. In any case, a lack of attention to her surroundings could have led her to move into your lane without realizing that your truck was there. IV. My truck may be in her blind spot. Blind spots are areas around a vehicle that are not visible to the driver through their mirrors or peripheral vision. It is possible that your truck was in the woman's blind spot when she decided to change lanes, making her unaware of your presence. This scenario is further supported by your description of your truck being in your own \\"A\\" pillar blind spot, as the position of your vehicle relative to hers could very well have placed you in her blind spot as well. Overall, in this particular situation, it seems most likely that a combination of factors (such as not paying attention to the traffic on the roadway and your truck being in her blind spot) could have contributed to the woman moving into your lane without realizing your truck was there."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Where was Chester before he returned home to Los Angeles? Alaska. Answer:","output":"Title: Journey from the North Genre: Adventure/Drama Step 1: Introducing the protagonist and setting We start our movie in Los Angeles, where our protagonist, Chester, is a young and ambitious city dweller working in the tech industry. He is originally from Los Angeles, but has recently returned from living in Alaska for a few years. Work colleagues and friends are curious about his time in the North, and Chester begins to tell his story in a series of flashbacks. Step 2: Establishing the inciting incident Before his return to Los Angeles, Chester was living in Alaska's wilderness, a striking contrast from the bustling city he knew all his life. In the flashback, we see what led him there: losing his job, his long-term girlfriend, and seeking a new beginning and refuge from his turbulent past. Step 3: Introducing supporting characters and relationships As Chester settles into his new life in Alaska, he meets a group of individuals who become close friends and teach him valuable life lessons. Among them are an experienced hunter, a native Alaskan, and a fellow self-exile seeking greater connections with nature. They help Chester acclimate to his new environment and become well-versed in surviving and thriving in the Alaskan wilderness. Step 4: Conflict and obstacles Throughout his time in Alaska, Chester faces numerous physical and emotional challenges. As the story progresses, it focuses on Chester's effort to adapt and overcome various obstacles like extreme weather conditions, learning how to hunt and gather resources, and dealing with emotional struggles and past traumas. Step 5: The climax and transformation During a particularly harsh winter, Chester and the group of friends find themselves trapped and must come together to make life-saving decisions. The experience tests Chester's resolve and forces him to confront his own limitations and vulnerabilities. Through these trials, Chester's understanding of himself, his relationships, and his connection to nature deepens and transforms. Step 6: Resolution and return to Los Angeles After several years in Alaska, Chester receives news that his father is unwell. As a result, he makes the difficult decision to return to Los Angeles to be with his family. His experiences in Alaska have shaped him into a more resilient and competent person, and he carries a newfound sense of purpose and self-awareness. Step 7: Conclusion and tying up loose ends Upon arriving back in Los Angeles, Chester reconnects with old friends and finds they no longer fully understand him due to the growth he has experienced in Alaska. He uses his learned skills and personal growth to create a better life for himself, his family, and finds new ways to apply his wilderness experiences in his urban context. The movie ends with Chester cozying up with a newfound love interest, telling her stories of his life-changing journey in the Alaskan wilderness, and looking forward to the future with optimism and courage. Through Journey from the North, Chester allows viewers to experience the thrill and challenge of stepping out of their comfort zones and discovering new purpose and meaning amidst setbacks and obstacles."},{"instruction":"This is a question with answer options. Goal: How do you remove seeds from a watermelon? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options are: [a].

Using a small knife or spoon, scrape off the seeds and transfer the seedless watermelon portions to a plate. [b]. Cut the watermelon vertically into 1-inch-thick slices. Working with 1 slice at a time, gently break the watermelon along the vein of seeds. Using a small knife or spoon, scrape off the seeds and transfer the seedless watermelon portions to a bowl....I think the answer is","output":"[a]. Cut the watermelon vertically into 1-inch-thick slices. Working with 1 slice at a time, gently break the watermelon along the vein of seeds. Using a small knife or spoon, scrape off the seeds and transfer the seedless watermelon portions to a plate. After examining the options provided, option [a] is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of removing seeds from a watermelon. It is a more manageable approach due to the step-by-step process and the use of a plate, which allows for a neater and more organized workspace. Transferring the seedless watermelon portions to a plate allows you to have better control over the portions and avoid overfilling the bowl, as mentioned in option [b]. Option [b] mentions transferring the seedless watermelon portions to a bowl. Using a bowl for this purpose is not as advantageous as using a plate because a bowl's depth and limited surface area make it more difficult for you to sort through the watermelon pieces and easily separate the seeds. This could result in an increased likelihood of accidentally consuming seeds or requiring additional time to inspect and remove them from the bowl. Furthermore, as you continue to remove seeds and add the watermelon portions to the bowl, the increasing quantity of watermelon in the bowl may make it more challenging to distribute the seedless portions evenly, which can cause inconvenience when serving. By following option [a]'s instructions, you are not only making the seed-removal process more efficient and organized but also ensuring that the seedless watermelon portions will be properly separated and easier to serve. This method streamlines the process and reduces the risk of any remaining seeds being consumed, making it the more reasonable choice overall."},{"instruction":"Q:A court case with a tough judging might result in what?

Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"The statement \\"Soldiers have no rule or regulations to follow and have a license to kill.\\" is false. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process explaining why: 1. Soldiers are part of a country's military, which is a highly structured and hierarchical organization. Therefore, they must adhere to a strict set of rules and regulations that govern their behavior, decision-making, and actions. 2. One of the most important set of rules followed by soldiers is the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), also known as International Humanitarian Law (IHL). This body of law seeks to regulate how military operations are conducted, protect civilians and individuals not taking part in the hostilities, and minimize the suffering and destruction caused by armed conflict. 3. The LOAC prohibits soldiers from indiscriminately killing. They must follow the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity. Distinction requires soldiers to distinguish between civilian and military targets, ensuring that only combatants are attacked. Proportionality requires that the harm caused to civilians is not excessive compared to the military advantage gained. Necessity ensures that force used is only to achieve a legitimate military objective. 4. Soldiers are also bound by their respective nation's military rules and regulations, such as the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the United States. These regulations address various aspects of a soldier's responsibilities and conduct, including the use of force, treatment of detainees, and rules of engagement. 5. Soldiers do not have an unrestricted \\"license to kill.\\" Any violation of the LOAC or their country's military laws can result in serious consequences, such as criminal charges, court-martial, and even imprisonment. 6. Soldiers also receive training on the rules and regulations they must follow, ensuring they understand their responsibilities and the legal and ethical boundaries they operate within. In conclusion, soldiers are bound by various rules and regulations, including international and national laws. They do not have an unrestricted \\"license to kill\\" and must adhere to the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity when conducting military operations."},{"instruction":"The Local Government Association says a shortfall in children's services budgets will reach £2bn by 2020. The LGA calculates that the shortfall will be £100m more than was suggested by its previous analysis last October, which had put it at £1.9bn. The government said its reforms would deliver quality care for all children. There is already evidence of a funding gap, according to the LGA, with councils having spent £600m more than they had budgeted for in the year 2015-16. It says the overspend is due to increased demand for children's social care, accompanied by cuts to funding from central government, along with inflation. The LGA says that population changes mean extra services will be needed, likely to cost an extra £1.1bn each year by 2019-20. At the same time, reductions to central government grants mean children's services budgets will be down £900m a year, even if councils raise business rates and council taxes to the maximum allowed under government rules, it adds. The LGA is calling for urgent action to address this widening funding gap and warns that services in many areas are \\"being pushed to breaking point\\". It points to significant increases in demand in recent years: Tough decisions on how to allocate scarce resources mean early intervention services have been cut and families must reach crisis point before they receive help, warns the LGA. \\"There are very few savings left to find without having a real and lasting impact upon crucial services that many children and families across the country desperately rely on,\\" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board. \\"Early intervention can help to limit the need for children to enter the social care system, lay the groundwork for improved performance at school and even help to ease future pressure on adult social care by reducing the pressure on services for vulnerable adults. \\"However, councils are in a difficult situation where they are struggling to invest in this vital early help and support.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \\"We want every single child, no matter where they live, to receive the same high quality care and support - and this is exactly what our reforms are set up to deliver. \\"We are clear that providing help as early as possible is the most effective way of keeping children safe, and our new What Works Centre for children's social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice.\\" What Works is a government-led initiative to enable commissioners of public services to access independent evidence across a range of social policy areas.

This is the best answer because it demonstrates the proactive and determined mindset necessary for someone to achieve their dreams. By springing into action, the person is actively seeking the opportunities and working tirelessly to get closer to their desired goals. Accepting his fate would imply that the person has given up on the possibility of achieving their dreams and is resigned to living a life that doesn't align with their aspirations. This is not the best answer because it doesn't reflect an attitude of actively striving for success. Crossing the street is an unrelated action in this context and doesn't have any direct impact on the person's efforts to achieve their dreams. It is a mundane action that does not show any intent of working towards a specific goal. Feeling upset can be considered a natural reaction to setbacks or obstacles when trying to achieve one's dreams. However, this is not the best answer because getting upset or feeling discouraged does not actively contribute to achieving success. It is crucial to acknowledge emotions, but it's also vital to not let them hinder one's progress. Traveling to Europe might be relevant to the person's dreams if their aspirations pertain to this continent or if it offers opportunities to work towards their goals. However, merely traveling to Europe without the context of springing into action does not guarantee that the person will achieve their dreams. Therefore, it is not the best answer. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"spring into action,\\" as it embodies the mindset and actions necessary to actively pursue and achieve one's dreams.

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. The coroner, witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good IL' boys club but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on death row, was all fabricated. The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him. The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting, Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. He gets a re-trial and Blair is freed. I think... film over.... Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used \\"white guilt\\" to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris. now Blair is on the loose again, thanks to Connery's deluded PC principles! The final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades. That was one weird film. So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry.

Translation from German to English is done based on the meaning of each word and grammatical rules shared between the two languages. To translate a sentence, we start by identifying key nouns, verbs, and other elements, then rearranging and substituting them with corresponding elements in English. b. The phrase \\"Die Konferenz der Präsidenten hat beschlossen\\" translates to \\"The Conference of Presidents has decided\\". Here, \\"Die Konferenz der Präsidenten\\" (the Conference of Presidents) is the subject of the sentence, and \\"hat beschlossen\\" (has decided) is the verb phrase. c. \\"auch die Thema des Unterseeboots in Gibraltar\\" translates to \\"also the topic of the submarine in Gibraltar\\". Here, \\"die Thema des Unterseeboots in Gibraltar\\" is the object of the sentence. It's important to note that in German, \\"Thema\\" is a neuter noun, therefore \\"the\\" is translated to \\"das\\". However, \\"das\\" changes to \\"die\\" in the accusative case when \\"Thema\\" is associated with a definitive article. d. \\"auf die heutige Tagesordnung zusetzen\\" translates to \\"to add to today's agenda\\". In this part, \\"auf die heutige Tagesordnung\\" means \\"to today's agenda\\", and \\"zusetzen\\" means \\"to add\\". e.

Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime last week have heightened tensions internationally. There's been tough talk from Western leaders and a flurry of activity by the United States -- all of which seem to suggest that a military strike against the regime could be in the offing. But through it all, Syria seems to retain the support of some good friends. Why do Russia, Iran and China continue to support a regime that's accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in the 2-year-old civil war? Here's why. Who wants what after chemical weapons horror So, it's in","output":"Russia, Iran, and China's best interests to maintain their support for the Syrian regime for various intertwined reasons, including upholding regional stability, geopolitics, economic considerations, and ideological stance. Russia's interest in maintaining a close relationship with Syria is rooted in several factors. Firstly, Syria is Russia's last military foothold in the Middle East, with the Tartus naval base being one of the key strategic assets for Russia in the region. This military presence allows Russia to exert influence and project power in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern affairs. Secondly, Russia's ongoing support for the Syrian regime is a means of countering US influence in the region and asserting its status as a global power, despite its historical decline. Furthermore, Russia has extensive economic ties to Syria, including arms deals and investments in the country's energy sector, which it is keen to protect. Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict stems from its quest for regional dominance and the promotion of Shiite interests. Syria acts as a vital link between Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, and ensures the supply of weapons and other resources to the group. Hezbollah's enhanced regional power translates into greater power and influence for Iran in the Middle East. Iran views the survival of the Assad regime as paramount because a collapse would significantly undermine its regional objectives as well as potentially leave it more isolated. Furthermore, Iran perceives the Syrian conflict as a proxy war against its rivals - Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States. China's foreign policy is driven by a desire for political stability, securing access to resources, and safeguarding its global economic interests. The Syrian conflict provides China with an opportunity to project its growing influence in the Middle East while also adhering to its principles of non-intervention and state sovereignty. China is concerned that a Western-led intervention in Syria might create a precedent that could undermine its own internal security and territorial integrity. Additionally, China has economic interests in Syria, specifically in the oil sector, that it wishes to protect. In conclusion, despite the allegations of chemical warfare and the potential humanitarian catastrophe, Russia, Iran, and China continue to support the Syrian regime due to a combination of strategic, economic, and ideological reasons. All three countries perceive their involvement in the conflict as essential for achieving their long-term objectives in the region and beyond. As the situation in Syria remains fluid, these countries' positions may evolve to accommodate shifting political and military landscapes. Nonetheless, their current interests dictate that they maintain their support for the Assad regime, despite growing international pressure and criticism."},{"instruction":"How is \\"In the case of lawyers, there are to be clear safeguards, particularly as regards maintaining the right of confidentiality.

It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Martin Luther (10 November 1483 18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707 29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns. - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian. - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius. - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. - Joseph ( Hebrew , Yosef ; Greek : , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed . - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.

Part #2: Use non-stereotypical language if possible. Usage: The individual hastened to the lavatory due to an intense sensation of queasiness. This example uses less common synonyms (hastened, lavatory, intense sensation, and queasiness) in place of the more common words (rushed, bathroom, and nausea), making it less predictable and more interesting. Part #3: Make the answer reasonably long and consistent with the context. Usage: Feeling an overwhelming wave of nausea as a side effect of the antibiotics for their skin infection, the person found themselves urgently making their way to the bathroom in no time at all. This answer is longer, ensuring it does not oversimplify the situation, while still remaining consistent with the context. Part #4: Use common sense, not just explicit extraction from the context. Usage: The individual's swiftness in reaching the bathroom can be attributed to the unpleasant nauseous sensation, likely caused by the antibiotics for their skin infection. This answer considers that the nausea is linked to the antibiotics and uses common sense to determine why they had to rush to the bathroom. Part #5: Avoid words from the given context. Usage: The cause for the prompt restroom visit can be linked to a queasy feeling, presumably a side effect of the prescribed medication for the dermal infection.

Some of these methods are mentioned below: 1. Choose the appropriate bolt: Select the correct bolt type, size, and length that is suitable for your project. Factors affecting the bolt choice include the type of wood, the thickness of the wood pieces, and the design of the connection. 2. Pre-drilling: Drill a pilot hole, slightly smaller than the bolt diameter, in the wood where you want to insert the bolt. This will help to prevent the wood from splitting or cracking due to the pressure exerted by the bolt. Make sure to use the appropriate drill bit size for the bolt being used. 3. Use washers: Adding a washer between the bolt head and the wood surface distributes the clamping force evenly, minimizing the risk of the wood cracking under pressure. Additionally, incorporating a washer on the nut side of the connection, helps to prevent the nut from digging into the wood when tightened. 4. Apply a thread locking compound: Using a thread locking compound, such as Loctite, on the bolt's threads can help prevent it from loosening due to vibrations or other external forces. Apply the compound to the bolt's threads before inserting it into the wood and tightening the nut. 5. Tightening torque: To make sure the bolt stays securely inserted, tighten the nut to the appropriate torque based on the bolt size and specifications. Over-tightening can lead to wood damage and compromise the strength of the connection, while under-tightening may result in a loose bolt. 6. Use of locknuts: A locknut is specifically designed to resist loosening when properly tightened on a bolt. They can be used instead of standard nuts to ensure a secure connection that is less likely to loosen over time. Some popular types of locknuts include nylon-insert locknuts and distorted-thread locknuts. 7. Threaded inserts: Installing a threaded insert in the wood can provide a more solid and durable base for the bolt to be thread into. Threaded inserts are metal sleeves that are installed in a pre-drilled hole and can then receive the bolt without causing damage to the wood over time. 8. Periodic inspection and maintenance: To ensure long-term bolt security, perform regular inspections of the bolt and nut connections, checking for signs of loosening, wood damage, or corrosion. Tighten or replace the bolts as needed to maintain a secure connection. 9. Combine with adhesives: In some cases, using adhesives like wood glue or epoxy in conjunction with bolts can create a stronger and more secure hold. Apply the adhesive to the wood surfaces before joining them together and inserting the bolt. However, this option may not be suitable for connections that need to be disassembled or adjusted in the future. 10. Consider using alternative fasteners: Depending on the application, it might be worth exploring other types of fasteners, such as wood screws, dowels, or metal brackets. These alternatives can sometimes provide better holding power and ease of installation. By implementing these techniques, you can ensure that the bolt stays securely inserted in the piece of wood, providing a long-lasting, strong, and sturdy connection for your project."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You will be given one or more triples.

The couple chose to rent a quad bike, skipping on taxi service, but unfortunately, they were not insured. The fateful decision led to a tragic accident, as the couple crashed their bike on the Greek island roads. The incident occurred when the quad bike lost control due to its wheels locking up, rendering Miss Simmonds unable to steer. The vehicle veered off the road and tumbled down the side, resulting in Miss Simmonds' legs becoming severely mangled. Additionally, she broke her finger and nose during the fall. In the aftermath of the accident, Miss Simmonds managed to call the last number on her mobile phone, which connected her with a local diving school. It was a stroke of luck as one of the diving instructors, Peter Tovey, hurried to the scene and utilized his first aid skills to stabilize her condition temporarily. Mr. Tovey creatively used his sandal to fashion a makeshift splint for Miss Simmonds' leg, buying her some valuable time before she could be airlifted to receive proper medical treatment. Miss Simmonds' injuries were extensive, including multiple fractures in her leg. She subsequently spent six months in a wheelchair, recovering and regaining mobility to some extent. Unfortunately, the severity of her injuries has left her with a permanent disability, as she is not expected to fully regain her leg strength. This cautionary tale highlights the importance of being adequately insured while engaging in adventure activities during holidays abroad. Melanie Simmonds and her boyfriend's decision to rent a quad bike without insurance has led to dire consequences, emphasizing the need for tourists to take necessary precautions when indulging in such thrill-seeking endeavors. Praise should also be given to Peter Tovey, whose quick thinking and resourcefulness likely saved Miss Simmonds from even worse outcomes. His timely intervention serves as a reminder of the importance of first aid knowledge and the heroism that can emerge in critical situations."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: On Monday night, back on the way home from school, I was suddenly faced with a big snow storm which I had never met before. The traffic was moving at 5 mph on the freeway where it usually requires at least 60 mph. The road is very slippery. Sometimes the car is out of control, slipping to the other side. I finally managed to drive to the Issaquah. However, I still got stuck in the traffic on an uphill way to my home. Why I lived in the house on the top of the hill? I had no choice but left my car in the road. Fortunately, there was a nice guy coming to help me drive the car to the parking lot so that I would not get a ticket from the policeman. When he first opened my car door and asked me if I needed any help, I thought I saw an angle. No kidding, I was totally frustrated at that moment until I saw the guy. After waiting in the parking lot for almost 3 hours, my husband's cousin finally managed to come to \\"rescue\\" me by his four-wheel drive car and sent me to my in-laws' home because the road to my house was closed. When I got to my bed in the end, it was over midnight. I spent almost 5 hours outside instead of 20 minutes as usual. But I was lucky, because I knew later that some people spent 7 or 10 hours to go home, and just by walking rather than by driving. This strong snow storm has messed up the traffic of Seattle and I get an unforgettable experience from it. Question: Where did the author spend the night that day?

You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel? Inventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives. One family in the UK went \\"back in time\\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones. The grandmother, Lyn, said, \\"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer.

You may notice that you sweat a lot more or that you smell very bad. These are not attractive qualities so be sure to shower and wear deodorant every day. Also remember to brush your teeth and style your hair. Keeping basic hygiene makes sure that she does not get grossed out. Always stay fresh and clean even when you're not in school because if you run into her friends in the mall and they think that you smell, the rumour will spread quickly back to her. Without even knowing it, you may have already blown your chance. Take deodorant to school with you, if allowed, in your sports kit on P.E. days. While each girl will like her own specific style, take pride in how your dress. Have confidence in your appearance and know what works for you. You want to feel comfortable in your outfits so that it will be one less thing to worry about. This does NOT mean forcing your friends to ask out a girl on your behalf but it can mean using them to help you look better or find out information about her. It also has the added effect of showing that you are a sociable person and fun to be around. If you aren't friends already, introduce yourself when you are working in a group or when you are sitting next to each other. Talk to her in class, but don't be obnoxious. Don't talk to her too much, just say hi when you find yourself around her or wave if you see her around school. Talk to her whenever the opportunity presents itself. Start by simply asking, \\"How's it going?\\" Don't be creepy or awkward by lingering at her location without saying something. If you have nothing to say, don’t force it. Just greet her and move along. Make sure to make a good impression on them as they are her first line of defense. If she is much more popular than you, or in a different social circle, more effort will be required. Try and talk to that group to get closer to her, and be seen in a different light. A girl is much more likely to go out with you if you have gained her trust and respect on a friendship level. Start slow and chat as acquaintances. Don't be too eager to please her. Leave her intrigued and looking forward to her next encounter with you. Becoming friends can happen by sitting next to her in class, teaming up with her for class projects, interacting with her friends, or getting her number or social media handles to chat. Find a topic that interests you both and chat with her as often as you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions and to change topics so that you can continue the conversation and, more importantly, get to know more about her. Don't try to force a conversation and make things awkward with silence. It's okay to end a conversation if you don't feel like it's flowing in your favour. Try to find common hobbies and interests. For example, you may chat about video games because there are a surprising number of girls that enjoy them as much as boys. Local sports teams are also a great topic to chat about. For example, you can say \\"Hey, did you catch last night's game?\\" If she's sad ask \\"What's wrong\\" and if she doesn't want to tell you about it then say \\"We're friends, you know I would understand\\" Know that you are you're own person and that she should like you for who you are. It's okay to have your own opinion. Disagreeing with her or not liking something that she likes is okay. If she doesn't like you for your opinion then you know it wasn't meant to be, but always respect others and yourself. If your opinion is rude or disrespectful, you may have other problems to address. If you make body jokes, do it in moderation. If you do it too much you will come off as crude and immature. if you do it in moderation you may make her laugh and come off self confident if you joke about yourself. Do not be a disrespectful or a bully. People are allowed to have their own opinion. Make sure that you're able to have an open conversation without turning it into a shouting match or worse. Open doors for her and help her carry her books without her having to ask for it. Girls really love these small sweet gestures of kindness and they will notice it. You don't have to buy her an expensive gift for her birthday to make her happy when you can give her something sentimental like a small key chain of a funny joke you two shared.

The rockets are used to carry instruments from above the surface of the Earth; the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites (the maximum altitude for balloons is about and the minimum for satellites is approximately ). Certain sounding rockets, such as the Black Brant X and XII, have an apogee between ; the maximum apogee of their class. Sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors. NASA routinely flies the Terrier Mk 70 boosted Improved Orion lifting payloads into the exoatmospheric region between . - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. - In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \\"elongated\\" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1. - In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Thor - Delta , also known as Delta DM - 19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s . A derivative of the Thor - Able , it was a member of the Thor family of rockets , and the first member of the Delta family . The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM - 19 configuration . The second stage was the Delta , which had been derived from the earlier Able stage . An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage . The Thor - Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage . This configuration was reused for a large number of later rockets , and a derivative , the Delta II , remained in service into 2011 . The Thor - Delta launched a number of significant payloads , including the first communications satellite , Echo 1A ; the first British satellite , Ariel 1 ; and the first active direct - relay communications satellite , Telstar 1 . All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17 . The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B , while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight , which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due a problem with the second stage . - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body). - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and satellite launches between 1958 and 1960. It was a two stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage, and a Vanguard-derived Able second stage. On some flights, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family, and an early predecessor of the Delta. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.

He lived in a time when rules controlled what African Americans could do. He was a top athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball. But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947. He believed that Robinson not only had the skills, but the courage to face the challenge of becoming modern baseball's first black player. It wasn't easy. Robinson sometimes faced boos from fans. But he became a star, anyway. In 1962, he became the first African-American player chosen to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Is According to East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, there is an intermediate state (Tibetan \\"bardo\\") between one life and the next. a good answer to this question? Options: I. yes. II. no.","output":"Option II: No. The provided answer, \\"According to East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, there is an intermediate state (Tibetan \\"bardo\\") between one life and the next,\\" does not adequately answer the question. The question asks specifically for the type of Theravada that rejects the intermediate state idea. Theravada Buddhism is also referred to as the Doctrine of the Elders. This branch of Buddhism is highly conservative and bases its teachings on the Pali Canon, which consists of the oldest and most complete record of the Buddha's original teachings. Theravada Buddhism is commonly practiced in countries such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand. Now, as for the type of Theravada Buddhism that rejects the intermediate state idea, it is important to note that Theravada Buddhism, unlike East Asian or Tibetan Buddhism (Mahayana and Vajrayana, respectively), generally does not emphasize the concept of an intermediate state (bardo). Most Theravada Buddhists believe in the instantaneous and direct transfer of consciousness from one body to another after death, instead of an intervening period in an intermediate state. This view is based on interpretations of the Pali Canon, where it is implied that rebirth takes place immediately after death. Therefore, the overall orthodox position held by Theravada Buddhism rejects the idea of an intermediate state. However, within the various interpretations, teachings, and traditions in Theravada Buddhism, there could be beliefs that do not strictly adhere to the orthodoxy or vary in aspects. Though it is difficult to identify a specific categorization for such Theravada adaptations, some individual practitioners or groups may lean towards acknowledging or exploring the concept of an intermediate state. Nonetheless, these would still be considered as divergent views within the broader context of Theravada Buddhism, which mainly rejects the intermediate state idea."},{"instruction":"Solve 149*z - 902 - 7626 = -59*z for z.. What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation 149z - 902 - 7626 = -59z for z, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation. The left side of the equation contains two constant terms, -902 and -7626. Combine these terms: 149z - 902 - 7626 = 149z - 8528 Now, the equation looks like this: 149z - 8528 = -59z Step 2: Add 59z to both sides of the equation. To isolate the variable z, we need to eliminate the -59z term from the right side of the equation. To do this, add 59z to both sides: 149z - 8528 + 59z = -59z + 59z This simplifies to: 208z - 8528 = 0 Step 3: Add 8528 to both sides of the equation. To further isolate z, we need to eliminate the -8528 term from the left side of the equation. To do this, add 8528 to both sides: 208z - 8528 + 8528 = 0 + 8528 This simplifies to: 208z = 8528 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 208. To get z by itself, divide both sides of the equation by 208: 208z / 208 = 8528 / 208 This simplifies to: z = 41 So the solution for the equation 149z - 902 - 7626 = -59z is z = 41."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century. But I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive.

They’ve been underperforming the broader market, as well as stocks with very low hedge fund ownership, as investors have slashed their risky bets. If the stock market’s volatility continues or picks up, experts expect hedge funds’ most loved stocks to be especially vulnerable. “I want to be short those,” the famed short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, known for betting against Enron, tells Fortune. Short selling, of course, can expose you to losses, so typical investors might do better just to avoid these three hedgie favorites—each of which has at least a fifth of its shares owned by hedge funds. Autodesk, which makes design software, is a hedge fund favorite, with 27% ownership. Those investors include activists ­Sachem Head and Eminence Capital, which together scored three board seats in March. That’s not necessarily good: Autodesk’s CEO previously slammed the activists as short-term players whose demands “would almost guarantee [the ­company] would have no long-term future.” Autodesk is on track to lose money this year for the second year in a row, yet it trades at more than 142 times what it earned the last time it was profitable. That valuation could make investors even more likely to freak and bail if the market gets rough.

The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter. Question: Lin's success in N.B.A has _ . Answer: Select from the following. * attracted more Chinese children to play basketball as a career; * drawn Chinese people's attention back to the league; * helped his hometown develop sports shirts business; * helped his hometown attract more foreign visitors; Answer:","output":"Lin's success in N.B.A has drawn Chinese people's attention back to the league. As explained in the article, Lin's amazing success over the last month has captured the imagination of the Chinese audience, becoming a topic of popular discussion and winning him a massive fan base. This has reignited interest in the N.B.A, bringing Chinese fans' attention back to the league after the retirement of previous basketball legend, Yao Ming. To elaborate, it is observed that Jeremy Lin's rise to fame in N.B.A is even more exciting for Chinese basketball enthusiasts because of their connection to his ancestral roots. The story of Lin's grandmother migrating from the northern Zhejiang province to Taiwan resonates with the Chinese, resulting in Lin's popularity rising particularly in this regione. Known as Lin Shuhao in China, Internet users show great admiration for him, cheering for his exceptional performance in basketball. Furthermore, Lin's success also stimulated the basketball-themed merchandise industry in China, with sports shirts linked to Lin selling out, including both original and counterfeit ones. This attention on Lin's success in N.B.A showcases his widespread influence as it helps to draw Chinese people's attention back to the league and keeps the N.B.A a hot topic of Chinese online chatter. Importantly, Chinese fans' rekindled interest in the N.B.A, induced by Lin's success, demonstrates the powerful impact of sports, especially basketball, in connecting communities and fostering shared interest among millions of fans in China and other parts of the world. It shows how individuals like Lin, with their talent and dedication, can inspire fans and revive the popularity of a sport and associated leagues within a community or country."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed? Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him.\\" In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the...

This suggests that the British Crown was using these pirates to further their own interests, possibly in a time of war or tension with other nations. Such a letter would essentially legitimize these pirates' actions and provide them with official backing from the British government, albeit in a covert and deniable manner. However, the statement \\"The pirates plundered ships of any other nation\\" cannot be conclusively inferred, as it would require a more explicit description of the scope and nature of the activities these pirates were authorized to perform. Issuance of letters of accreditation might involve certain restrictions and guidelines for the pirates to follow, which could limit their targets to specific nations, shipping routes, or particular types of vessels. That being said, it is plausible that such an arrangement might lead to the pirates targeting ships belonging to rival nations or enemies of the British Crown, especially if it furthered British foreign policy objectives. Nevertheless, we cannot conclusively state that the pirates plundered ships of any other nation without more information about the directives provided to them by Modyford and the British government. In summary, while Modyford's letters of accreditation indicate that the pirates were acting on behalf of the British Crown, it is not definitive that they were authorized to attack ships from any country. Further information about the nature of the letters of accreditation and the extent of the activities these pirates were sanctioned to conduct would be necessary to draw such a conclusion."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. and a hint : Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Please answer this question : Would patient B see nearby objects clearer or blurrier than patient A? Answer:","output":"Patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A. Step 1: Understand the situation and the hint provided - John is an ophthalmologist and has seen two patients, A and B. - Patient A has hyperopia, but patient B doesn't have any eye issues. - Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, causes distant objects to be seen clearly while nearby objects appear blurry. Step 2: Determine how the conditions of patients A and B affect their vision - Patient A has hyperopia, so they would have trouble seeing nearby objects clearly. - Patient B doesn't have any eye issues, so their vision for nearby objects would be normal. Step 3: Compare the clarity of nearby objects for both patients - Patient A has difficulty seeing nearby objects due to hyperopia. - Patient B has normal vision and doesn't have issues seeing nearby objects. Conclusion: Patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A because patient B doesn't have any eye issues, while patient A has hyperopia which causes nearby objects to appear blurry."},{"instruction":"Article:The airline said it believed it could deliver profitable growth across Europe \\"despite the uncertainty of Brexit\\".

Claim: \\"Space Invaders released to electronic devices.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search? Options: - yes - no","output":"The claim states: \\"Space Invaders released to electronic devices.\\" To provide a detailed answer, let us break it down into three parts: 1. What is Space Invaders? 2. What does it mean for it to be released to electronic devices? 3. Can this claim be verified by human common sense and without a web search? 1. Space Invaders is a popular video game that was first introduced in 1978. It was created by Tomohiro Nishikado and published by Taito Corporation. It became one of the most iconic arcade games of all time and had a significant impact on the development of the video game industry. 2. The phrase \\"released to electronic devices\\" implies that the game, originally designed for arcade cabinets, has been made available on other electronic devices, such as consoles, handheld systems, and computers. Over the years, Space Invaders has indeed been adapted and ported to various platforms, including personal computers, consoles, and handheld devices. 3. As for verifying this claim without conducting a web search, that depends on the individual's knowledge and experience with the gaming industry. If someone is familiar with Space Invaders' history and its numerous adaptations, they might deduce that the claim is indeed correct. However, if the person lacks knowledge of video game history, they might not be able to verify this claim without researching further. So, based on the assumption that one has enough knowledge about the history of Space Invaders, the claim can be assessed as correct.

For the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. Although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected. The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic. Unfortunately I don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, CGI effects dating to what I'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. To top it all off (and I guess I should warn you now **SPOILER ALERT**) it all turns out to be a dream.

How is the effect of demonetization on employment? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"To answer the questions, I will first address each one individually, provide relevant information, and then compare them to determine if they are the same or different. Question 1: What are the positive effects of demonetization? Step 1: Define demonetization Demonetization is the process by which a government removes a particular currency's status as legal tender, often replacing the old currency with a new one. Step 2: Identify the positive effects of demonetization 1. Reduction in black money: Demonetization can help curb the circulation of black money, the undeclared or untaxed income concealed from government authorities, by rendering the outdated currency notes useless. 2. Encourages digital transactions: Demonetization can push people towards digital transactions as they look for alternative ways to make payments without cash. 3. Increased tax revenue: When people deposit their old currency notes into the banking system, it becomes easier for authorities to track unaccounted income, which can lead to increased tax revenue. 4. Reduction in counterfeit currency: By replacing the old currency notes with new ones, the circulation of counterfeit currency can be reduced. 5. Counteracting financial crimes: Illegal activities funded through black money, such as terrorism, drug trade, and smuggling, can become more difficult if the sources of illicit funds are curtailed through demonetization. 6. Helps in formalizing the economy: As more transactions take place through the banking system, it can lead to a more formalized economy with better financial tracking and accountability. Question 2: How is the effect of demonetization on employment? Step 1: Analyze the possible short-term effects 1. Negative impact due to cash crunch: In the short term, demonetization may result in a cash crunch, which could lead to a slowdown in the economy and job losses, particularly in sectors that rely on cash transactions. 2. Impact on informal sector: Smaller businesses and workers in the informal sector, which largely depend on cash, might face temporary unemployment. Step 2: Examine the long-term effects 1. Formalization of economy: As demonetization pushes the economy towards formalization, there might be a shift of employment from the informal to the formal sector. 2. Encouragement of new industries: Technological developments and the rise of digital transactions may lead to the emergence of new industries and job opportunities in areas like FinTech, e-commerce, and digital payments. Comparison: Are the questions the same? No, these two questions are not the same. The first question asks about the positive effects of demonetization, which can encompass a wide range of topics, including the reduction of black money and the increase in digital transactions. The second question, on the other hand, specifically focuses on the impact of demonetization on employment, be it short-term or long-term effects. In conclusion, the first question addresses the broader positive effects of demonetization, whereas the second question deals specifically with its impact on employment. Therefore, the questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Where are the chemical weapons coming from?

On that day, the temperature reached a scorching 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius). This measurement was taken at the Furnace Creek Ranch (previously known as Greenland Ranch), which is located in the heart of Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest and driest places on the planet. Death Valley, a desert valley located in Eastern California within the Mojave Desert, is known for its extreme weather conditions, searing heat, and staggeringly low humidity levels. Due to its unique geological features, such as its below-sea-level basin and high surrounding mountain ranges, air temperatures in Death Valley can soar to unbearable levels during the summer months. It is worth mentioning that there was another temperature record of 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit (58 degrees Celsius) recorded on September 13, 1922, in Al Azizia, Libya. However, after an in-depth investigation by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this reading was declared invalid in 2012 due to various inconsistencies and issues with the measurement process. Consequently, the 1913 Death Valley reading remains the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth's surface. The extreme heat in Death Valley and other parts of the US has various consequences, such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and dehydration for living beings. Additionally, these soaring temperatures can exacerbate drought conditions, increase wildfire risk, and contribute to a myriad of environmental and ecological problems. While the high temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit in Death Valley is an extreme record, it serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by humans, animals, and plants that inhabit such harsh environments. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of continued research and monitoring of temperature extremes to better understand the impacts of climate change and how best to adapt and respond to these changes in the future."},{"instruction":"Biff wanted to watch a western movie.

Example: \\"As outlined in our initial agreement, a late fee of 50 is charged for every 30 days the payment is overdue. As your payment is now 60 days late, you have incurred a total of 100 in late fees.\\" Step 3: Give a Deadline Set a clear deadline for the recipient to make the full payment, inclusive of any late fees. Stress that failure to comply with this deadline may result in further actions, such as involving a collections agency or pursuing legal avenues. Example: \\"To avoid additional consequences, please make the full payment of 1100, including the outstanding balance and late fees, within the next ten business days.\\" Step 4: Conclude Your Letter End your letter by reinforcing the importance of a prompt resolution to the outstanding balance. Mention that you would prefer not to take further action and hope that the matter is resolved quickly. Example: \\"We value our relationship with you and would like to avoid pursuing additional measures. We hope to receive your payment promptly and resolve this matter amicably.\\" Step 5: Mail the Letter Once you have composed the final demand letter, make sure you send it via certified mail or a method that provides proof of delivery. It is essential to have evidence that the recipient received your letter in case further action becomes necessary. Conclusion: While sending a final demand letter may seem like a daunting task, it is a crucial step in addressing late payments. By identifying your letter as a final demand, explaining late fees, setting a deadline, and concluding your message with a call for resolution, you can effectively communicate the seriousness of the outstanding balance. Remember, always be professional, factual, and straightforward to ensure your letter is both compelling and effective."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

No detail was overlooked, as John-Jack used his creativity and sharp eye for design to enhance the overall experience. Each table setting was thoughtfully arranged with fine china plates and silverware, accompanied by a skillfully crafted menu, a feast for the eyes as much as the stomach. As they grew increasingly eager, guests mingled and socialized, trading stories about the clandestine invitation and their enchanting host, trying to piece together the puzzle of just who John-Jack is, and how he came to create Entre dinner parties. Soon, the entrancing evening began. With each exquisitely prepared course, John-Jack showcased his deep understanding of both local and global cuisines. The freshest ingredients, sourced from nearby farms and markets, graced every plate, allowing guests to taste the very essence of Missouri. The harmonious collaboration between flavors, textures, and presentation turned dining into a multisensory experience, leaving a lasting impression on all those present. No meal is complete without complementing wines and libations, hand-selected by John-Jack himself. Each beverage was purposefully chosen to enhance the flavors of each course, bringing the culinary journey to new heights. As the evening continued, guests found themselves not only enjoying the food and drink but also forming connections with those around them. After all, Entre dinner parties are as much about forging relationships as they are about indulging in gastronomic delights. As the moonlit night progressed, the guests couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unforgettable evening.

Joker is a radical reinterpretation and audacious reimagining that’s completely distinct from any other representation of the character we've seen before. This isn't a bombastic blockbuster filled with high octane action sequences, nor does it benefit from a loaded superhero ensemble cast. Instead, it homes in on lone character Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill stand-up comedian who, grappling with societal neglect and personal demons, gradually morphs into the infamous agent of chaos, the Joker. A significant portion of the film's success rests on the shoulders of its lead, Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck/Joker is truly a masterclass in performance. He is both sympathetic and disturbing, forcing the viewer to empathize with his escalating desperation and alienation even while recoiling from his growing hostility. His physical transformation, gaunt and malnourished, matches his psychological descent, making his performance eerily believable and profoundly chilling. Director Todd Phillips leans heavily into Martin Scorsese-influenced aesthetics, especially evoking memories of \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"The King of Comedy\\". The grimy, garbage-laden streets of Gotham mirror the corruption and decay that lurks beneath its societal structures. The cinematography, lighting, and overall mise-en-scène, coupled with a haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, all collaborate to weave an atmosphere that's relentlessly grim and oppressively bleak. The narrative unravels in a grounded, plodding pace that reflects Arthur’s joyless, oppressive existence. Cinematically, \\"Joker\\" is a triumph, filled with sequences that linger in the mind, particularly the now infamous dance on the staircase that symbolizes Arthur’s full transition into the Joker. However, the movie isn't without its controversies. Many critics have worried about the film's potential to sympathize with toxic disillusionment or to embolden the kind of individuals it portrays. Its unflinchingly dark tones and themes, and its willingness to present horrifying violence in realistic ways, make it divisive and potentially troubling for some audiences. To sum up, \\"Joker\\" is a deeply psychological, character-driven film that delves into realms often left unexplored in comic book movies – showcasing a spectacular performance from Joaquin Phoenix, a mesmerizing ambiance and a story that is as provocative as it is disturbing. Its controversial exploration of mental health and societal neglect is bound to engage in conversation long after you leave the theatre. It is a bleak reflection of our times, a movie that is intended to unsettle and provoke – a cinematic experience not to be forgotten.

Washington (CNN) -- First-term Democratic incumbent North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan lost in a tight contest against GOP challenger Thom Tillis, according to a CNN projection. It was the most expensive Senate race this cycle: A great deal of the funding was provided by out-of-state organizations backing harsh television attack ads. The neck-and-neck race was key to Republicans' plans to win back the Senate from Democrats. With 99% of precincts reporting their vote totals, Tillis had 49 % to Hagan's 47%. Tillis is known for his conservative stances on issues like same-sex marriage and women's abortion rights. He worked to nationalize the race by tying Hagan to President Obama, who suffers from high disapproval ratings in the Tar Heel state even though he -- along with Hagan -- were victorious there in 2008. Tillis made national news in late October when he debated an empty chair on live television after his opponent refused to attend what was initially billed as a debate between the two candidates. Hagan launched aggressive attacks on Tillis' tenure in the state legislature, highlighting how his legislature cut unemployment benefits, slashed funding for education and prohibited the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. She also worked to bolster her own appeal with racial minorities by pointing out Tillis' enactment of a strict voter identification law.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: 22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. They have a single piece of circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of the plasma membrane. Some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili. Bacteria and Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. In archaeal membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids, are linked to glycerol. Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers. The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis. The chemical composition of cell walls varies between species. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan, but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls. Bacteria can be divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on the Gram stain reaction. Gram-positive organisms have a thick cell wall, together with teichoic acids. Gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins.

At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family. The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage. Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity. How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"To find the solution, we first need to determine the maximum capacity of the spacecraft. At full capacity, the Gibraltar can carry 300 family units with four people per family: 300 family units * 4 people per family = 1,200 people (maximum capacity) Now we know that when the spacecraft leaves Earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of its capacity: Step 1: Find one-third of the maximum capacity. One-third of 1,200 is 1,200 / 3 = 400 people. Step 2: Subtract 100 people from this number. 400 people - 100 people = 300 people.

Article: Jerry Morris died on 28 October 2009. He was 99 years old. You have probably never heard of him. He was a professor of public health. More than 50 years ago he produced one of the most famous epidemiological papers of the 20th century. His study showed that bus conductors were much less likely to die of heart disease than bus drivers. Why? Because the conductors spent their working day walking. It seems obvious now but in the middle of the last century doctors were puzzled by the rising numbers of people who got heart diseases. Jerry Morris found one of the main causes: a sedentary lifestyle. He started exercising for a few minutes each day and lived until his 100th year. If you wish to protect your heart, you have to do more than wander in the garden. The exercise needs to be reasonable. Jogging is not for everyone and a round trip to the gym takes a couple of hours, plus the monthly membership fee is only good value if you visit regularly. The answer is simple: walk. A half-hour purposeful walk five times a week will lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes and strokes. Older people sometimes feel they have left it too late. But it is never too late to start and there are no upper age limits. Start gently. Take your time: a 15-minute flat walk in the nearest park, four or five times a week. Within a month or so, you are already beginning to protect your heart. Build the walks up. When you can comfortably walk for half an hour in the park, go further: try following rivers and canals. Regular walkers have their own natural gymnasium. There is no membership fee, just some of the finest scenery in the world. Great Britain is the walker's gym. When you have followed the rivers and canals, and are enjoying walking for a couple of hours, head for the coast. Once again, build it up slowly.

Bella: (smiling) Absolutely, Aiden! This historic park has always sparked my interest, and I'm thrilled to finally visit. Aiden: It's one of my favorite places, honestly. There's so much history to uncover in each corner of the park. Bella: I see many monuments scattered around. What's the story behind these majestic structures? Aiden: Oh, where do I even begin? Each monument represents a significant aspect of our history. For example, the sculpture over there (pointing) commemorates a battle from the early 1700s. It's said that soldiers from both sides displayed unwavering courage and determination. That monument aims to capture that spirit by presenting a kneeling soldier with a flag in hand, symbolizing both their bravery and vulnerability. Bella: That sounds amazing, Aiden! I'm sure my students would appreciate learning more about the history behind these monuments. Can we see some more of the park? Aiden: Sure thing! As we walk along this path, take note of the plaques lining our route. Each one offers a glimpse of the people or events that have shaped our shared history. (Bella and Aiden walk a bit further, and they stop in front of a small stone bridge.) Bella: What's the history behind this charming little bridge, Aiden? Aiden: Ah, the Love Locks Bridge! It was built in the late 1800s and has since become a symbol of everlasting love for couples who visit the park. You can see the locks fastened to the bridge's railings, each one representing the love and commitment between two people. Bella: (smiling) That is beautiful! It's fascinating how such a small bridge can carry so much meaning and emotion. It makes me wonder how the individuals behind each lock experienced their time here, and how their stories connect to our own. Aiden: That's exactly what makes places like this so magical, Bella. They serve as constant reminders of the evolving human experience, shaped by the delicate balance between past and present. (As they continue strolling, they arrive at a small garden with a water fountain in the center.) Bella: Oh, Aiden, look at this lovely fountain! The intricate carvings are a testament to the skilled artisans who worked on these historical sites. Aiden: Indeed, this particular fountain is called \\"The Dance of Time.\\" It represents life's journey through various stages - from the innocence of childhood, the excitement of adolescence, the wisdom of adulthood, to the peace of old age. Water symbolizes the flow of time, a force that propels every aspect of our lives. Bella: I can imagine my students enjoying this park as much as I do, Aiden! It's like walking through the pages of a living history book. Aiden: That's a perfect way to describe it. Every corner of this park carries stories that not only teach us valuable lessons but also invite us to reflect on our own roles in the grand tapestry of time.

Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" A:","output":"Which of the following statements best describes the findings of the research conducted by Liverpool University on the effects of reading classical literature? A. Reading works by Shakespeare and Wordsworth temporarily increases brain activity, but has no long-term benefits. B. The complexity of classical literature encourages self-reflection and triggers increased brain activity, making it a better therapy than some guide books. C. Reading Shakespeare and other classical authors has no significant impact on the brain or mental health. D. Following a modern guide book is more effective in stimulating the brain than reading classical literature."},{"instruction":"Question: Who played Hannah in the 1986 film ‘Hannah and Her Sisters’?

Article: Relation between the United States and Columbia suffered for many years because of an incident involving the Republic of Panama. By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia 10 million plus 250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that an important reason for the decision of the United States to build a canal was to _ . Options: A: develop trade relations with Europe B: improve relations with South American countries C: prevent European ships from reaching the Pacific Ocean D: reduce travel time for its ships in case of war Answer:","output":"D: reduce travel time for its ships in case of war"},{"instruction":"People are healed of various diseases and infirmities and even receive answers to the desires of their hearts after they dip themselves in Muan sweet water, or just drink or apply it.

It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.

The Falcons moved the ball 72 yards on their 12-play opening drive, but settled for a 26-yard Jason Elam field goal after being stopped on 3rd-and-3 from the 8-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 15-play drive of their own, beginning with a 19-yard dump-off pass to Morris. No other play on the drive would go for more than 9 yards, and the Patriots themselves were stopped short of a touchdown, with wide receiver Joey Galloway catching a pass with his foot out of bounds in the back of the end zone on what would have been a 7-yard touchdown pass. Instead, the Patriots could not reach further than the Falcons' 2-yard line and settled for a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to tie the game. The Falcons next drive was a three-and-out that began the second quarter, with a 29-yard Michael Koenen punt and a 5-yard penalty on the Falcons giving the Patriots the ball at their own 49-yard line. After two pass attempts, Taylor had runs of 8, 19, 6, and 8 yards, with the final rush good for a touchdown and a 10-7 Patriots lead. Beginning their next drive from their own 41-yard line after a 33-yard return by Eric Weems, the Falcons moved into Patriots territory on one play before an apparent strip-sack of second-quarter quarterback Matt Ryan by safety Brandon McGowan; the Falcons challenged the ruling (which included a touchdown return by cornerback Shawn Springs) and won, as Ryan's arm was going forward when he lost the ball. Another Jenkins reception, this one for 21 yards, moved the Falcons deeper into Patriots territory before running back Michael Turner ran for a 2-yard touchdown that tied the game. Following a Patriots three-and-out, the Falcons again moved into Patriots territory, but a Turner fumble at the Patriots' 27-yard line, forced by McGowan, was recovered by safety James Sanders with just under four minutes remaining in the half. The Patriots' 12-play drive brought them into the red zone, but a dropped pass by Galloway just outside the end zone and an incompletion to wide receiver Sam Aiken in the end zone forced a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal that gave the Patriots a 13-10 lead going into halftime. The Patriots began where they left off at the start of the second half, embarking on a 13-play drive that entered into the red zone on a 23-yard Watson catch. However, the Patriots' offense stalled in the red zone again, with two incomplete passes to Moss setting up a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal. Ryan and Jenkins continued to connect on the Falcons' ensuing drive; a 26-yard reception put the Falcons in Patriots territory and then a 36-yard touchdown pass was nullified on a pass interference penalty on Jenkins. With a subsequent false start penalty, the Falcons were pushed back into Patriots' territory and eventually forced to punt. The Patriots next drive spanned 70 yards on 16 plays and was kept alive on a 4th-and-1 conversion from the Patriots own 24-yard line. Again, it did not involve a touchdown though, as Gostkowski kicked a 33-yard field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 19-10 early in the fourth quarter. After an exchange of three punts, the Patriots began a 6-play drive that resulted in their first passing touchdown of the day, a 36-yard reception by tight end Chris Baker that extended the Patriots lead to 26-10; it was also Brady's 200th career touchdown pass. After a Falcons three-and-out, the Patriots held the ball for the final 6:52 of the game to seal a 26-10 victory. Based on the above article, answer a question. Who goal was settled for to tie the game","output":"In the game described, the New England Patriots settled for a goal, which was a 21-yard field goal by their kicker, Gostkowski.

Analyzing the Review: The review begins with comparison with another dessert place, acknowledges the difference but still appreciates the topping selection. It mentions some physical inconveniences related to location and traffic like poor visibility of the store and issue with entry and exit. However, the reviewer speaks highly of the staff, the quality of yogurt, and the ambience of the shop. They show appreciation for the theme of the shop, and express satisfaction that this type of shop is located close to their home. 2. Categorizing the Sentiment: The sentiment is primarily positive. The critique about the visibility and parking is constructive criticism, rather than a complaint, and is outweighed by the positive comments about the staff, the yogurt, and the overall ambiance. The reviewer also expresses personal satisfaction about the proximity of the shop to their home, which adds to the positive sentiment. 3. Describing the Sentiment: The overall sentiment of the review could be described as 'mostly positive with some constructive critique'. It paints the shop in a good light, while also highlighting areas for potential improvement.

When you suggest that a smaller red giant has more gases to disperse, you are implying a change in the system's initial conditions or properties, and not directly impacting any single step mentioned above. However, with more gases to disperse, the process of the core collapsing and forming a white dwarf might be influenced, as the red giant stage could have an extended lifetime, or the white dwarf that is formed may have different characteristics than in the original scenario.

For example, if the list has two items ('A' and 'B'), the output should be a list of two inner lists: [['A'], ['B']]. 3. Solve the task using the guidelines: Given the input list ['6', 'x', '3', '9', 'i', 'b'], remove one item at a time and create new lists as follows: - Drop '6': ['x', '3', '9', 'i', 'b'] - Drop 'x': ['6', '3', '9', 'i', 'b'] - Drop '3': ['6', 'x', '9', 'i', 'b'] - Drop '9': ['6', 'x', '3', 'i', 'b'] - Drop 'i': ['6', 'x', '3', '9', 'b'] - Drop 'b': ['6', 'x', '3', '9', 'i'] 4. Now, combine all the new lists together into one list as the final output: [ ['x', '3', '9', 'i', 'b'], ['6', '3', '9', 'i', 'b'], ['6', 'x', '9', 'i', 'b'], ['6', 'x', '3', 'i', 'b'], ['6', 'x', '3', '9', 'b'], ['6', 'x', '3', '9', 'i'] ]"},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with the directions of a recipe separated by \\",\\" and have to fill in the \\"___\\" which is a step that is missing from the recipe.

Let's take French as an example: \\"Le bonheur est un voyage, pas une destination.\\" Translated in English, it means \\"Happiness is a journey, not a destination.\\" This wise French saying reminds us that we should not expect to find happiness only at the end of whatever journey we are on–be it an educational, career, or personal journey–but rather discover it in the everyday moments that make up our lives. In French culture, this phrase serves as a reminder to enjoy the present and the process. The French have a knack for appreciating the little things in life, which is perhaps best encapsulated in their well-known phrase \\"joie de vivre\\" or \\"joy of living\\". They believe that it's important to extract joy from the simple moments and routines each day: a warm cup of coffee, a conversation with a friend, the smell of a fresh baguette from the bakery. It illustrates a profound understanding and appreciation of life—a wisdom that you don’t have to constantly strive for big milestones to experience happiness, but instead find pleasure and contentment in the ordinary and mundane. Spanish and Italian, among other Romance languages, also express similar sentiments about the importance of embracing the journey, which suggests that such an attitude is quite universal. These cultures, too, emphasize the value of enjoying the present moment–demonstrating a shared wisdom that happiness doesn’t just exist in life’s final destination, but is scattered throughout the path leading to it. In essence, my example sentence in French encapsulates a profound ideology that transcends languages and cultures, delivering a universal message about what makes a fulfilling life: striving for happiness in the everyday, rather than seeing it as a distant goal to be achieved. This idea teaches us to appreciate the journey of life, because ultimately, it is through the journey that we experience the richness of living."},{"instruction":"President Barack Obama dodged a question on Friday about whether American troops will be part of a new NATO rapid response force in Eastern Europe set up to warn Russia that Western nations could quickly mobilize if an allied country in the region were to come under attack. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the new unit would send a clear message to potential aggressors in a thinly veiled warning to Vladimir Putin. 'Should you even think of attacking one ally, you will be facing the whole alliance,' he declared as a two-day NATO summit in southern Wales drew to a close. said in a press release Friday that","output":"In the press release on Friday, [Your Organization] addresses the recent developments in NATO's strategy and responses to potential threats in Eastern Europe. The creation of a new rapid response force demonstrates the alliance's commitment to the security and stability of the region. The press release consists of the following points: 1. The announcement of the new NATO rapid response force in Eastern Europe: This force is designed to deter potential aggressors such as Russia from considering an attack on any allied country in the region. This measure is taken in light of recent tensions and conflicts in the area, notably the Russian involvement in Ukraine. 2. President Obama's response: While President Obama did not provide a direct answer to the question of whether American troops would be part of this new force, the statement from the NATO Summit highlights the unity and strength of the alliance. It is important to remind the audience that the United States has consistently been one of the driving forces behind NATO, and its involvement in the organization's initiatives is often essential. 3. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen's warning: The statement made by Rasmussen clearly communicates the message that an attack on any NATO member country will trigger a collective response from all member nations. This serves as a reminder to potential aggressors, such as Russia, that any further actions that threaten the stability of Eastern Europe will have serious consequences. 4. The significance of the two-day NATO summit in southern Wales: As this summit drew to a close, the decisions made and statements issued demonstrate the alliance's solid stance and determination to protect its member nations.

To address this issue, let's analyze the question in depth to better understand the context and provide a more coherent response. First, let's examine the two parts of the statement: 1. \\"If yeah uh-huh oh so you don't need a personal one\\" 2. \\"Can we conclude that 'You definitely need a personal one!'?\\" The first part of the statement is not very clear, as it utilizes filler words (yeah, uh-huh, oh) which do not add any value to the meaning. It would benefit the statement if it were rephrased to focus on the matter at hand. A better phrasing might be: \\"If it is the case that you don't need a personal one,\\" The second part of the statement seems to be asking whether, given the above-stated premise, we can conclude that a personal item is absolutely necessary. In its current form, the statement is contradictory, as it is negating the premise in the first part. This contradiction can be addressed by rephrasing the statement to better align with the premise: \\"Can we conclude that 'You might still benefit from having a personal one!'?\\" Now that the statement has been restructured, it conveys a clearer and more coherent meaning. However, without further context on which \\"personal one\\" the statement is specifically referring to, it is difficult to offer a definitive answer. In most instances, it is essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of having a personal item, considering factors such as cost, convenience, personal preference, and necessity. Let us assume that the statement refers to a personal transportation vehicle, such as a car. In this context, the rephrased statement would read: \\"If it is the case that you don't need a personal car, can we conclude that 'You might still benefit from having a personal car!'?\\" In this scenario, suppose you live in a city with excellent public transportation systems and don't require a car to travel for work or leisure. It may initially seem unnecessary to have a personal vehicle. However, you might still find value in owning one for times when public transportation is unavailable or inconvenient, for transporting large items or for traveling to more remote areas. Therefore, whether or not you \\"definitely need a personal one\\" depends on the specific context and your priorities.

UPDATED:. 09:49 EST, 19 June 2012. The number of Asians moving to the U.S. has surpassed Hispanics for the first time ever, reflecting a slowdown in illegal immigration while employers increase their demand for highly-skilled workers. An expansive study by the Pew Research Center details what it describes as 'the rise of Asian-Americans,' a highly diverse and fast-growing group making up nearly 6 per cent of the U.S. population. Mostly foreign-born and naturalized citizens, their numbers have been boosted by increases in visas granted to specialized workers and to wealthy investors as the U.S. economy becomes driven less by manufacturing and more by technology. Diversity: The number of Asian migrants entering the U.S. has surpassed Hispanics reflecting a slowdown in illegal immigration and more visas for highly skilled employees. 'Too often the policy debates on immigration fixates on just one part - illegal immigration,' said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California-Riverside and a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 'U.S. immigration is more diverse and broader than that, with policy that needs to focus also on high-skilled workers.' He added: 'With net migration from Mexico now at zero, the role of Asian-Americans has become more important.' Around 430,000 Asians, or 36 per cent of all new immigrants, arrived in the U.S. in 2010, according to the latest census data. That's compared to about 370,000, or 31 per cent, who were Hispanic. Across the nation: Regional dispersal of Asian-Americans, according to the latest census data. The Pew analysis,. released today, said the tipping point for Asian immigrants likely. occurred during 2009 as illegal immigrants crossing the border from. Mexico sharply declined due to increased immigration enforcement and a. dwindling supply of low-wage work in the weak U.S. economy. Many Mexicans already in the U.S. have also been heading back to their country, putting recent net migration at a standstill. As recently as 2007, about 390,000 of new immigrants to the U.S. were Asian, compared to 540,000 who were Hispanic. The shift to increased Asian. immigration, particularly of people from India, China and South Korea,. coincides with changes in U.S. immigration policy dating to the 1990s. that began to favor wealthy and educated workers. The policy, still in place but subject to caps that have created waiting lists, fast-tracks visas for foreigners willing to invest at least half a million dollars in U.S. businesses or for workers in high-tech and other specialized fields who have at least a bachelor's degree. The study revealed variations among Asian subgroups which belied their typecast as a 'model minority' POVERTY: As a whole, Asian-Americans had a. poverty rate in 2010 of 11.9 per cent, lower than the 12.8 per cent for. the general U.S. population. By country of origin, however, Koreans,. Vietnamese and Chinese were more likely than the average American to. live in poverty, at rates of 14 per cent or more. EDUCATION: The share of. Asian-Americans who hold at least a bachelor's degree surpasses the. national average, 49 per cent to 28 per cent. Vietnamese, however, fell. below the national average at 26 per cent. People from India were most. likely to have a college degree, at 70 per cent. UNEMPLOYMENT: Asian-Americans ages 25 and older were somewhat less likely to be. unemployed than the national average for the first quarter of 2012 - 6. per cent compared to 7.4 per cent for all U.S. workers. But in terms of. long-term unemployment, Asian-Americans fared much worse, with median. duration of unemployment at 28 weeks, second only to African-Americans. (31 weeks). The national average was 22 weeks. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: While immigrants from Asia often obtain visas and arrive. legally, many also sneak across the U.S. border or become undocumented. residents after overstaying their visas. Up to 15 per cent of Asian. immigrants in the U.S. are here illegally, compared to 45 per cent of. Hispanic immigrants. International students studying at U.S. colleges and universities are now most likely to come from Asian countries - around six in ten - and some of them are able to live and work in the U.S. after graduation. Asian students, both foreign born and U.S. born, earned 45 per cent of all engineering Ph.D.s in 2010, as well as 38 per cent of doctorates in math and computer sciences and 33 per cent of doctorates in the physical sciences. Several bills pending in Congress that are backed by U.S. businesses seek to address some of the visa backlogs, through measures such as eliminating per-country limits on employment-based visas or encouraging investment in the sluggish U.S. real estate market. They have stalled amid broader public debate over immigration reform that has focused largely on lower-skilled, undocumented workers. In recent years, more than 60 per cent of Asian immigrants, aged 25 to 64, have graduated from college, double the share for new arrivals from other continents. As a whole, the share of higher-skilled immigrants in the U.S. holding at least a bachelor's degree now outpaces those lacking a high-school diploma, 30 per cent to 28 per cent. 'Like immigrants throughout American history, the new arrivals from Asia are strivers,' said Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center and co-author of the report. 'What's distinctive about them is their educational credentials. These aren't the tired, poor, huddled masses of Emma Lazarus's famous inscription on the Statue of Liberty. They are the highly skilled workforce of the 21st century.' The findings are part of Pew's broad portrait of Asian-Americans, immigrants or U.S.-born children of immigrants who come mostly from China, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. Now tied with Hispanics as the fastest-growing U.S. group, the nation's 14.5 million Asian-Americans are slowly becoming visible as founders of startups in Silicon Valley, owners of ethnic eateries, grocery stores and other small businesses in cities across the U.S., as well as candidates for political office and a key bloc of voters in states such as California, Nevada and Virginia, according to experts. Deterrent: Illegal immigration to the U.S. from Mexico has dropped following moves like the fences along with Arizona-Mexico border. Projected to make up one in ten residents by mid-century, Asian-Americans as a whole tend to be more satisfied than the general public with their lives and the direction of the country. They lean Democratic, prefer a big government that provides more services, and place more value on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success. The Pew survey is based on an analysis of census data as well as interviews with 3,511 Asian adults living in the U.S., conducted by phone from January 3 to March 27. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points for all respondents, higher for subgroups.","output":"The number of Asians migrating to the US has surpassed Hispanics for the first time, reflecting a decrease in illegal immigration and an increase in demand for highly skilled workers in the technology sector.

In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system. - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) .

He was nicknamed the \`\` Spam King '' by prosecutors . - In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching. - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians. - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964. - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements. - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations. - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The Treaty of Berlin, which superseded the Treaty of San Stefano, provided for the establishment of a much smaller Bulgarian state compared to the autonomous Bulgarian principality initially proposed. The two locations that the Treaty of Berlin specifically provided for were Moesia and the region of Sofia. This decision left large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the newly formed country, contributing to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Vaše Výsosti, vymysleli jsme to spolu.

Translate to Czech","output":"To translate \\"letting loose\\" into Czech, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the meaning of \\"letting loose\\" in its context. In this case, I assume it's a phrase used to describe relaxing and having fun, and not the literal meaning of releasing something. 2. Consider possible translations of the phrase and its meaning into the Czech language. Since it's an idiom, a direct translation might not convey the intended meaning, so we should find a Czech phrase or idiom with a similar meaning. 3. Choose the appropriate translation based on the context and common usage. Based on these steps, the Czech translation for \\"letting loose\\" as in relaxing and having fun is \\"odvázat uzdu\\", which literally means \\"to loosen the reins\\".

The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and kilims not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to mosques, which often amassed large collections of them.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The art of carpet weaving first gained significant prominence in the nomadic cultures of Central Asia. This region, comprising modern-day countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, is known for their rich and diverse tapestry of art, including the intricate craftsmanship of carpet weaving. The nomadic tribes of Central Asia found carpet weaving particularly suitable for their way of life because the rugs served as easily transportable forms of furnishing. These carpets were not merely decorative objects but carried immense practical value as well. They were designed to provide warmth and insulation, especially as nomadic tribes lived in harsh and barren landscapes with extreme weather conditions. Additionally, the carpets symbolized the tribe’s wealth and social status, playing a fundamental role in their culture and traditions. As these nomadic tribes interacted with neighboring regions, the art of carpet weaving started spreading across other areas, eventually reaching Anatolia. The arrival of the Turks in this region played a crucial role in further popularizing and refining the craft of carpet weaving. As the Ottoman Empire emerged and began to conquer new territories, the art continued to flourish, ultimately making it synonymous with the empire's grandeur, wealth, and taste in fine arts. In the context of the Ottoman Empire, the role of carpets extended beyond practical use. They were considered both a luxury item and an essential part of the daily life, taking on religious and symbolic meanings. This could be observed in their use in residences, where it was customary to remove one's shoes. Carpets adorned not just the floors but also the walls and doorways, enhancing insulation and creating a plush domestic environment. Moreover, the tradition of donating carpets to mosques further amplified their religious and cultural significance. These carpets, often featuring intricate patterns and luxurious materials, embellished the sacred spaces and represented a way to honor the divine. As a result, mosques often accumulated vast collections of sumptuous carpets, reflecting the devotion and wealth of their patrons. In conclusion, the art of carpet weaving first gained significance in the nomadic cultures of Central Asia. Over time, it found its way to Anatolia, where it flourished under the patronage of the Ottoman Empire, transforming the craft into a decorative and functional object imbued with religious symbolism and cultural importance. Today, the legacy of this art form can be seen in the continued appreciation and collection of these carpets worldwide."},{"instruction":"Does \\"The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with Japan, the United States, and Spain, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments.\\" correctly answer the question of What is The Triple Entente?","output":"Yes, it does!

People were starting to move out, and businesses were closing left and right as the once vibrant streets turned silent and empty. We thought that downtown would be a better option, with its thriving community and promising opportunities. As we explored the downtown area, the decision to move there became even more appealing. Street musicians played uplifting tunes around every corner, and the tantalizing aroma of food from various world cuisines greeted us. Cozy cafes and bustling restaurants lined the streets, inviting visitors to sit down and enjoy a delicious meal. The local markets offered fresh produce and handmade items, while stylish boutiques showcased the trendiest clothing and accessories. The uniqueness of each establishment appealed to us, as every shop seemed to have its own story to tell. Moreover, the downtown community was diverse and welcoming.

The community embraced art and culture in a way that the uptown neighborhood had forgotten. Street art adorned the walls of buildings, and local galleries displayed the work of talented artists, both well-established and emerging.

We engaged a local real estate agent who quickly helped us find the perfect place in the heart of the downtown area. Upon moving, we began to make friends and connections within the community that would prove invaluable over time. The more we immersed ourselves in the downtown lifestyle, the more we realized that we had made the right choice. Our children grew up into inquisitive, open-minded adults who contributed positively to the community and the world at large. Meanwhile, our careers took off in ways we never could have imagined. We diversified our social and professional network, which led to countless opportunities and connections. Furthermore, the local events like art activations, farmer’s markets, and cultural festivals brought an ineffable joy and fulfillment to our lives.

In his zeal to promote nuclear power, filmmaker Robert Stone inserted numerous half-truths and less-than-half-truths in his new documentary \\"Pandora's Promise,\\" which CNN is airing on November 7. One of Stone's more misleading allegations was that scientists at a U.S. research facility, the Argonne National Laboratory, were on the verge of developing a breakthrough technology that could solve nuclear power's numerous problems when the Clinton administration and its allies in Congress shut the program in 1994 for purely political reasons. Like the story of Pandora itself, the tale of the integral fast reactor (IFR) -- or at least the version presented in the movie -- is more myth than reality. In the final assessment, the concept's drawbacks greatly outweighed its advantages. The government had sound reasons to stanch the flow of taxpayer dollars to a costly, flawed project that also was undermining U.S. efforts to reduce the risks of nuclear terrorism and proliferation around the world. Others told","output":"a different story, claiming that the technology had potential and that political motivations were the driving force behind its cancellation. However, upon closer examination of the evidence and weighing the potential risks associated with the IFR, it becomes clear that the decision to discontinue its development was grounded in a comprehensive understanding of its limitations and the potential dangers it posed. While proponents of nuclear power, like Robert Stone, may continue to promote the IFR as a silver bullet solution to the world's energy problems, the truth is that no single technology can provide all the answers. As we move forward in addressing the challenges of climate change and global energy demand, it is crucial to embrace a diverse array of technologies and solutions while remaining vigilant to the risks they may pose. In the end, the story of the IFR serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the importance of skepticism and thorough analysis in the pursuit of new and innovative energy solutions."},{"instruction":"Q:Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"Thomas's acid, which is a weak acid, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. This is because weak acids do not dissociate completely in aqueous solution, resulting in less hydrogen ions (H+) released when compared to strong acids, which dissociate fully. In simple terms, a strong acid, like the one Jacob had, releases more hydrogen ions when it dissolves in water, leading to a higher concentration of hydrogen ions. On the other hand, a weak acid, like the one Thomas had, releases fewer hydrogen ions due to its partial dissociation, resulting in a lower concentration of hydrogen ions. So, when comparing the ratio of hydrogen ions to the respective acids, Thomas's weak acid will yield a lower ratio than Jacob's strong acid."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who kills the owner of the house? , can you please find it?

They go to a nearby farmhouse and meet the owner, \\"Sam\\" (short for Samael), his wife Lilith, and their deaf handyman helper, Alal. Sam and Lilith let Chad and Scarlet sleep at their house, but during the night Chad and Scarlet are savagely knocked unconscious by Lilith and Sam. Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet discover that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but after they leave the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her in the head with a meat thermometer. Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife, seriously injuring him. The couple flees in Sam's pickup truck, but Sam revives and pursues them; Chad runs Sam over with the truck several times before they drive off. The answer is:","output":"Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife, seriously injuring him."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Step 1: Identify a general topic or subject that includes factual information.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Satisfactory Experience with Some Improvements Needed Review: I've been using com.google.android.gms for a while now, and overall, I would rate my experience as 3-stars. There are several good aspects to this app, but there are also areas in which it could be improved. To begin with, the app's performance is generally reliable. I have not experienced any major crashes or issues while using the app. The user interface is clean and simple, making it fairly easy to navigate. Furthermore, I appreciate the wide range of features and services it offers, such as location, maps, and authentication. However, there are some aspects that prevent me from rating this app higher. Firstly, I've noticed that the app can consume a considerable amount of battery power, particularly when it’s using location services. This can be quite inconvenient, especially when I am out and about and away from a charging source. Secondly, I've experienced occasional slow loading times and slight lagging when using specific features, like maps. This can sometimes result in navigation issues and delays in receiving real-time updates. Moreover, while the app is frequently updated, which is appreciable, sometimes these updates introduce new bugs or compatibility issues with my device. Although the developers usually resolve these issues in subsequent updates, it can still be frustrating at times. In conclusion, com.google.android.gms is a useful and versatile app, but there are some areas that need improvement to make it a truly seamless experience. If the developers can address these issues, such as battery consumption, performance, and bug resolution, I believe this app could easily be a 5-star offering. Until then, it remains a satisfactory 3-star app for me."},{"instruction":"Question: March 30, 1981 saw Ronald Reagan get shot in the chest by what asshat nutjob? Answer:","output":"On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan was subjected to an assassination attempt by John Hinckley Jr., who can be referred to as a misguided individual given your choice of words. John Hinckley Jr. had developed an unhealthy fixation on actress Jodie Foster after watching the movie \\"Taxi Driver,\\" in which Foster's character is saved by a man who attempts to assassinate the president. This caused Hinckley to develop an elaborate fantasy where he saw himself as the movie's protagonist, believing that by assassinating a prominent figure, Foster would be compelled to notice him and fall in love with him. He initially thought of targeting Jimmy Carter, but his plan did not materialize. Ronald Reagan, the newly elected president, became his next target. On that fateful day in March, Hinckley waited outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC, where President Reagan was delivering a speech. As the President was leaving the hotel, Hinckley fired six shots using a .22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver in a matter of seconds. One of these bullets ricocheted off the armored side of the President's limousine and hit Reagan in his left lung, just below the heart. He also hit police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, who survived, and critically wounded press secretary James Brady, who sustained a serious head injury that left him permanently disabled. Reagan was rapidly transported to George Washington University Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. He survived the attack despite severe internal injuries and loss of more than half his blood. His humor and bravery during the crisis— he reportedly joked with the doctors, \\"I hope you are all Republicans\\"— helped to reassure the public about his condition. John Hinckley Jr. was apprehended at the scene and later prosecuted on charges including attempted assassination of the president. Remarkably, Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity. This verdict led to widespread public outcry and many states rewrote their laws in response to the trial. Hinckley was confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. until 2016, when he was released and allowed to live with his mother under a regimen of strict supervision. The shooting incident also led to the implementation of stricter gun control policies in the United States, one of which was named the Brady Bill in honor of the injured press secretary."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX.

Nevertheless , PeopleSoft must review Oracle 's tender offer and make a recommendation to shareholders . Are these sentences conveying the same meaning?","output":"While these two sentences discuss the same general topic, they convey slightly different meanings. To understand the differences and similarities between them, let's break down each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"PeopleSoft's board now has 10 business days to evaluate the Oracle offer and make a recommendation to its shareholders.\\" This sentence states that PeopleSoft's board is given a specific timeframe of 10 business days to evaluate Oracle's offer. The board must then make a recommendation to its shareholders based on their evaluation. The sentence explicitly emphasizes the time constraint and suggests the urgency of the board's response. Sentence 2: \\"Nevertheless, PeopleSoft must review Oracle's tender offer and make a recommendation to shareholders.\\" While this sentence mentions that PeopleSoft must review Oracle's tender offer and present a recommendation to its shareholders, it does not mention any specific timeframe the board has for the evaluation. Also, the use of \\"nevertheless\\" implies that there may be previous contextual information in which the evaluation stands in contrast to or despite of. So, both sentences convey that PeopleSoft needs to evaluate Oracle's offer and make a recommendation to its shareholders. However, the first sentence emphasizes the 10-business-day timeframe, while the second sentence lacks any time constraint and hints at a potential contrast with a previous context. In summary, while these sentences share the core information that PeopleSoft must evaluate the offer and make a recommendation, they differ in the aspects of urgency and context that they communicate."},{"instruction":"This week , the challenge on Sunday Postcard Art is : Alter a Real Postcard .

This answer encompasses different essential aspects that voters often look for in a political figure who is relatively new to the political arena or who has not been an insider for a long time. These essential aspects can include breaking the status quo, having fresh perspectives, and bridging the gaps between different groups. A welcome change implies that voters are seeking a shift from the current state of affairs. They may be unhappy with the way that things are being handled by the government or do not see progress being made. The outsider candidate often represents the idea of disrupting the established way of doing things, leading to potential policy changes and improvements to many aspects of society. In voting for an outsider, individuals may also look for someone who has not been influenced by the prevalent political culture. It can be argued that long-time politicians might be more susceptible to lobbying, corruption, or simply adhering to their party's beliefs rather than those of their constituents. The outsider candidate represents a chance to inject new ideas and solutions into various political issues, thereby reinvigorating the political system. Moreover, outsider candidates may have a unique ability to bring together people from different walks of life. Due to their less-established political ties, they could potentially be more open to working with other parties to accomplish shared goals. In this way, people who vote for the outsider may hope to see an increase in cooperation and a decrease in the polarization that can often plague nations. However, it is important to note that there could also be concerns surrounding an outsider candidate. These concerns may stem from the candidate's lack of experience, a perceived inability to work with long-standing political figures, or even concerns about overall competence. Despite these potential issues, many individuals continue to vote for outsider candidates in the hope that their fresh perspectives and ability to challenge the status quo will outweigh the risks. In conclusion, people often vote for the outsider because they hope for a welcome change in the political landscape. Through their fresh perspectives, potential to ignite cooperation, and distance from established politics, outsider candidates can represent a departure from the norms that have kept societies in stagnation. While there may be concerns about their abilities to navigate the political system, many voters continue to place their faith in the possibility of positive change."},{"instruction":"How to time your trip to shanghai<br>Consider shanghai's climate and weather.

With the win, the BoSox, who snapped a five-game slide against their bitter division rivals, closed to within 6 1/2 games of New York for the lead in the AL East. Tazawa (2-2), whose introduction to the majors came on August 7 when he allowed a game-winning two-run home run to Alex Rodriguez in the 15th inning of a contest at Yankee Stadium, lasted six scoreless frames and was touched for just eight hits with two strikeouts and as many walks. \\"There were some pitches I couldn't locate well but when I needed to pitch, I could throw the ball pretty well,\\" said Tazawa. David Ortiz homered, knocked in three runs and scored twice for the Red Sox, who have won four of five. Alex Gonzalez added a solo homer, while Victor Martinez and Casey Kotchman also drove in a run apiece in the triumph, which saw the Sox pound out 15 hits. Nick Swisher went 3-for-5 with a solo homer for the Yankees, who saw their three-game winning streak halted. Robinson Cano also had three hits in the setback. A.J. Burnett (10-7) took the loss after giving up nine runs on as many hits in five innings of work.

In the first, consecutive one-out singles from Dustin Pedroia and Martinez made it first and third before Youkilis fouled out. Ortiz followed with a two- run double off the Green Monster and Jason Bay's RBI single made it 3-0. A solo homer from Gonzalez and Youkilis' three-run blast over the Monster in the second stanza gave the home team a 7-0 advantage. Ortiz had a two-out solo homer to left in the fifth, and Bay followed with a double and scored on J.D. Drew's ground-rule double into the bullpen in right to make it a nine-run game. Pedroia had a two-out double in the sixth and scored as Martinez followed with a single to center field. \\"Youk\\" kept it going with another homer over The Monster, which made it 12-0.

To be sure, Sessions isn’t likely to be the last among Trump’s nominees for the 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation to arrive dragging unhappy baggage, and there’s no point in everyone getting outraged at all of them. A bit of history, however, might help the doubters decide how to think about Sessions -- and, perhaps more important, help Sessions understand what he owes to the doubters. First, a bit of background on the nominee. In 1986, Sessions became the first of President Ronald Reagan’s nominees for a federal judgeship to be defeated. The reason, we are now told, was that he had made “racially insensitive” statements. He had indeed. His comments included the opinion that the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP were “un-American” (a remark he said under oath that he did not recall making) and a stupid joke about how he thought members of the Ku Klux Klan “were O.K. until I found out they smoked pot” (a remark for which he apologized). That was lot to swallow in 1986, and it’s a lot to swallow today. Abraham Lincoln famously said that in politics the statute of limitations should be short. But how short should it be? In the case of Sessions, as it turns out, history affords us a useful analogue. In 1959, the state of Georgia elected as its governor Samuel Ernest Vandiver, who during his campaign had pledged that under his administration “neither my three children, nor any of yours, will ever attend a racially mixed school or college in this state.” He promised that no black students -- “no, not one” -- would ever be admitted to a white public school. Among his advisers at the time was a young Atlanta lawyer named Griffin B. Bell. In 1961, President John Kennedy appointed Bell to the federal appellate bench. When Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976, he chose Bell to be his attorney general. These and other details of Bell’s past came out. He belonged to lily-white clubs. His civil-rights jurisprudence was said to “give clear signals and hope to those in this country who would want to do less than provide equal educational opportunity.” The NAACP fought his confirmation fiercely. I was a first-year law student at the time, and as details of Bell’s past emerged, I was every bit as furious as everyone else I knew. When in early January he was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Democratic-led Senate, a lot of us saw evidence that Dixie had indeed risen again and was now in charge. But Bell seemed to understand that he had to repair his image in the public eye. He was wise enough to see that something more than words would be required to quiet the fears aroused by his background. Part of Bell’s immediate response was to select for senior posts in the Justice Department two black men and one white woman, a move many of his critics met with praise. His years as attorney general included any number of racially charged disputes: cases about school busing for integration, the decision whether to file charges in the police killing of a young Hispanic man, and a very public argument over which position the administration should take in the Supreme Court’s first encounter with affirmative action in college admissions. Through it all, he developed a reputation for moderation. If his positions were not always my positions, neither were they dangerously radical. And Bell took another step, one that all too few recent attorneys general have attempted. Many observers were worried because he and Carter were so close. They had grown up together in Sumter County, Georgia; the press called them “cronies.” Bell responded by building “a giant barrier” to preserve the independence of the Justice Department from White House meddling. He even internalized most judicial selection, keeping the choices away from the president’s political operatives. All of these steps helped to quiet the fears of those who looked at Bell’s early career and worried. Probably the worries never really went away. And certainly he did not always live up to his own standards. But it was obvious to everyone that he was trying, and that simple fact made a difference. If Bell is not on the list of the truly great attorneys general, neither does he land on the list of failures. He did reasonably well, then slipped into history. There are lessons aplenty in this history, both for Sessions and for his critics. For the critics, perhaps it is best to accept that he will be a conservative, but on the issue of the now-ancient racial comments, give him, warily, a chance to prove himself. For Sessions himself, the lessons require action more concrete. He should do what Bell did, both by reaching outside the expected circle to find aides who, if not precisely of the left, at least show his critics that he is willing to meet them halfway. (And, yes, racial diversity will help.) Much more important is that he try, as Bell tried, to prove that he isn’t simply there as the president’s crony. This will require that he rebuild the wall, to let the White House know not to call anyone in the building but him -- and then to inform whoever is on the line that he is leaving the issue, whatever it may be, to his assistants, and would not insult them by passing on the administration’s views. Donald Trump isn’t Jimmy Carter, and people are tired of being told to hope for the best. But that doesn’t change my recommendation about what Sessions should do. Would taking these steps make him a perfect attorney general? Of course not. But that sets the bar too high. His job will be to do his job -- and to do it in ways that assure most of his fellow citizens that he is both independent of the White House and no longer the man who once made bad jokes about the Klan. The vote was 75-21. Those voting “nay” constituted an unusual coalition, running from the very liberal (for instance, George McGovern, Charles Percy and John Culver) to the very conservative (for instance, Strom Thurmond, Barry Goldwater and Jesse Helms). The wall, alas, was more permeable than it should have been. In 1978, Bell was criticized, and properly so, for firing David W. Marston, a Republican then serving as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, who was investigating at least two Democratic members of the House of Representatives. At least one of those under investigation had apparently called President Carter to complain, and Carter had called Bell. Bell insisted that he had asked Marston to remain at his post until the administration found a replacement who was his equal “in ability character and integrity,” but Marston refused to do so.

A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine), a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt. Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, US Army Capt. Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), on enlisted TDY to the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt. Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape. Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp. Hatch is indeed recaptured, but upon his recapture, he is put in solitary confinement. Because he is in solitary confinement, the prisoners do not know whether the intended escape has actually been planned with the underground, so Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting...

How do I decline working with a potential cofounder gracefully so that I don't burn my bridges and can possibly work or contact them in the future? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"1. Overcoming personal past traumatic experiences of bad therapy: To overcome your personal past traumatic experiences of bad therapy and avoid winding up like them in the future, you can follow the steps outlined below: a. Recognize and accept the impact: First and foremost, accept that bad therapy experiences have caused emotional and psychological damage. Identifying the impact these experiences have had on you is crucial in working towards overcoming them. b. Seek professional help: Find a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma or has experience in dealing with clients who have had bad therapy experiences. Choose someone whom you feel comfortable discussing your past experiences with, and trust their guidance throughout the process. c. Build a support network: Develop a network of friends, family, and peers with whom you can share your experiences and emotions. Seeking support from those who understand your experiences can help you process the negative emotions associated with past trauma. d. Develop self-awareness: Understand triggers or situations that may cause you to feel anxious or uncomfortable. By being self-aware, you can recognize when these feelings arise and consequently take steps to cope with them. e. Develop coping skills: Learn and practice healthy coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness, meditation, and journaling. These techniques can help you manage any anxieties or negative thoughts that may arise from previous traumatic experiences. f. Seek continuous learning: As you progress through graduate school, continuously learn from your experiences, and take constructive feedback positively. By doing so, you can grow professionally and avoid making the same mistakes in the future. g. Set boundaries: Become aware of your personal and professional limits and establish clear boundaries to avoid stress and overcommitment. This would also help in preventing circumstances that might trigger past trauma. h. Celebrate small wins: Focus on your accomplishments and the progress you make throughout your studies. Celebrating small wins can help boost your confidence and pave the way for a successful future. 2. Declining working with a potential co-founder gracefully: To decline working with a potential co-founder gracefully, while keeping open the possibility of collaboration in the future, consider the following steps: a. Schedule a conversation: Arrange for a formal discussion, preferably a face-to-face meeting or a video call, during which you can communicate your decision. b. Express appreciation: Start the conversation by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discuss the possibility of working together. Acknowledge the person's strengths, skills, and passion for the project. c. Be honest and transparent: Share your reasons for not wanting to move forward with the partnership in a clear, respectful, and honest manner. It's vital to be straightforward, but not harsh or blaming. d. Offer an alternative: Propose other ways you would be happy to support them, whether it be through networking, providing resources, or offering advice. e. Maintain professionalism: Keep the conversation focused on your mutual professional goals and potential future opportunities. Keep personal emotions out of the discussion. f. Stay positive and courteous: Even if you may not want to collaborate as co-founders, express that you are open to future partnerships in other capacities and maintain a positive attitude. g. Follow up: After your conversation, send a thank-you note or message to express your gratitude for their understanding. This step can help ensure that your relationship stays cordial. As for the third question, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about overcoming past traumatic experiences related to therapy in order to have a more positive future after graduate school. The second question is about declining an offer to work with a potential co-founder while maintaining good relationships for future opportunities.

It's hard to definitively interpret the emotion without more context, but we can safely say that she is not interacting directly with the older woman based on the description. The older woman is drinking. This connotes she is busy with her own activity, not necessarily engaging with the younger woman. Again, without further context, it's hard to infer more from her action. Next, the hypothesis states that the two women are hugging. Hugging is a physical action undertaken usually to provide comfort, express affection, or celebrate. This experience often involves at least some level of closeness and contact between the individuals. As we compare the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that the actions described do not overlap or implicitly suggest the conditions indicated by the hypothesis are happening. A woman looking down and another woman drinking does not imply or necessitate that they are hugging. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, due to a lack of corroborating information connecting the scenario described in the premise with the situation proposed in the hypothesis. The relevant interpersonal action detailed in the hypothesis (hugging) is not present or implied in the premise. Hence, the correct answer is, \\"No, we cannot conclude that the two women are hugging based on the premise provided.\\""},{"instruction":"Translate to Turkish: It has four more months to deal with lingering problems before the EC issues its next crucial assessment of the country's readiness to join the Union on 1 January 2007 as planned.

What percent of the cost is the ham and bread?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"To find the percentage of the cost for the ham and bread, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate the total cost of all the items. Total cost = cost of bread + cost of ham + cost of cake Total cost = 50 (bread) + 150 (ham) + 200 (cake) Total cost = 400 Step 2: Calculate the combined cost of ham and bread. Combined cost = cost of bread + cost of ham Combined cost = 50 (bread) + 150 (ham) Combined cost = 200 Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the total cost that the ham and bread represent. Percentage = (combined cost of ham and bread / total cost) * 100 Percentage = (200 / 400) * 100 Step 4: Simplify the expression to find the percentage. Percentage = (1/2) * 100 Percentage = 50% So, the ham and bread represent 50% of the total cost."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Manny visited 2 countries.

If you suspect your loved one has depression, take stock of his behavior to get a sense of his level of depression. Make a list of the symptoms that you notice. Frequent, prolonged, and/or seemingly unprovoked sadness Lost interest or pleasure in things that were once enjoyed Significant loss of appetite and/or weight Overeating and/or weight gain Disrupted sleep patterns (either unable to sleep or sleeping too much) Fatigue and/or loss of energy Increased agitation or decreased movement noticeable by others Feelings of worthlessness and/or excessive guilt Difficulty concentrating or feeling uncertain Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, attempting suicide or having a plan for suicide These symptoms may last for 2 weeks or more. They may stop and come back again. These are called “recurrent episodes.” In this case, the symptoms are more than just a “bad day.” They are a severe change in mood that affects the way someone functions in everyday life. If your friend has had a death in the family or another traumatic event, she may exhibit depressive symptoms and not be clinically depressed. Once you have recognized that your loved one is suffering from depression, you should be honest and have an open conversation with that person. If your loved one won't admit that there is a serious problem at hand, he will have a hard time getting better. Or you can talk to another close, trustable friend or relative about the person facing depression. They might handle these things better. Depression is a medical condition that can be diagnosed by a doctor. It also can be treatable. Reassure your loved one that the depression they’re feeling is real. Make it clear that you are worried about your friend. Don't let her brush it off by saying she's just having \\"a bad month.” If your friend tries to change the subject, steer the conversation back to her emotional state but if she/he gets aggressive (openly hesitates to talk) about it drop the subject. Find another appropriate time to talk about this. Remember that your loved one is suffering from an emotional problem and is in a very vulnerable state. Though it's important to be firm, don't come off too strong in the beginning. Don’t start by saying, \\"You're depressed. How are we going to deal with it?\\" Instead, start off with: \\"I've noticed that you've been pretty down lately. What do you think has been going on?\\" Be patient. It takes a while for a person to open up sometimes, so give it as much time as they need. Just try not to let him blow off the conversation. You probably want to help your friend as much as you can. But there's no simple way to \\"fix\\" depression. You can encourage her to get help, and you can be there for her. Ultimately, however, it's up to your friend to want to get better. Once your friend recognizes that he is depressed, you can talk about ways to start addressing it. Does he want to talk to a counselor? Does he want to see a doctor about a prescription treatment?

Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis The premise states that a particular theory is offensive to many people. The hypothesis suggests that the theory discusses space and time. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The premise informs us about the emotional reaction of individuals to the theory, while the hypothesis focuses on the content of the theory (i.e., space and time). Step 3: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis Entailment between two statements typically implies that the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second statement. In this case, knowing that the theory is offensive to many people does not guarantee that it is about space and time. Similarly, if the theory is about space and time, it does not necessarily mean it will be offensive to many people.

You need to have a strong understanding of the strategies and mechanics of the game. It is valuable for an associate scout to know as much as possible about playing the game of baseball so he can relate to prospects.. Baseball is in some ways a very technical sport, which means that baseball scouts need to have a keen eye and meticulous attention to detail. When you watch a game, practice the kind of behavior scouts do by paying attention to things like batting averages, running speeds, and pitching techniques. If you find it helpful, read up, both with books and online, on the strategies and mechanics of baseball, as well as the statistics and attributes that go into determining what separates a good player from a great player. Although there are plenty of scouts who have little experience actually playing the game, it can certainly help. Playing baseball gives you the kind of first hand experience with how the game is played and what makes a good player that you can't get from just watching. Any experience with the game from the player's perspective is going to give you a leg up when it comes to analyzing them from the other side. You don't need years of semi-professional experience or a college baseball career. Look for a recreational baseball group in your city, or put one together yourself. There exist courses that anyone can take that teach the foundations of how to be a scout. They are training programs designed specifically for a aspiring scouts. Search online to find scout courses near you. MLB has its own official scout school, but be aware that they only hold programs in a few states, and positions are limited. Scouting baseball isn't a particularly glamorous job. It involves constant traveling, long periods away from home, waking up early, and an exhausting amount of work. Scouts have a lot of information in their heads when they're out on the job, everything from the names of coaches and players in their area to batting averages and pitching speeds. As a scout, you'll see endless hotel rooms, high school and college games, plane flights and rental cars. Your tools are nothing more than a radar gun, a notepad, and a wealth of knowledge about the minute details of what makes a baseball player great. The most significant difference between scouting high school players and scouting college players is that with high school players, a scout needs to be able to project their skills farther into the future. College players will have already enhanced their speed, strength, and skill, thanks to both more experience and better, more specialized coaches. That being said, high school scouting is the more important of the two, because the players you'll be watching in college will be the ones you identified as worth watching in high school.","output":"This article is about how to become a baseball scout, including learning baseball strategies and mechanics, gaining playing experience, taking scouting courses, and understanding the differences between scouting high school and college players."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What traditional shop would one find a razor in?

Saudi Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Company, is an oil and natural gas company founded in 1933 when the government of Saudi Arabia signed a concession agreement with Standard Oil Company of California (SoCal), to prospect for oil in the region. 2. SoCal assigned this agreement to its then 50% owned subsidiary, California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC). 3. CASOC discovered a significant oilfield in 1938, and this discovery marked the beginning of oil production in the kingdom. 4. In 1944, the company’s name was changed to Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). 5.

In 1988, the company was officially renamed Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), and it was fully nationalized in 1980. Although assassinations have occurred in the region due to various political reasons, none of them are directly related to the formation or subsequent expansion of Saudi Aramco.

The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. Now answer this question: Who founded the Gelug school?","output":"The Gelug school, also known as the Yellow Hats, was founded by the disciples of Je Tsongkhapa. Je Tsongkhapa was a famous teacher of Tibetan Buddhism whose activities led to the formation of the Gelug school. He was greatly associated with the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was established by Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen between 1346 and 1354 after he toppled the Sakya Dynasty. Je Tsongkhapa's teachings have had a significant influence till modern times, with the Gelug school playing a central role in the spiritual and political life of Tibet. The school emphasized monastic discipline and scholarly learning, which appealed to many during a time of great political and social unrest. The disciples that followed Je Tsongkhapa's teachings are responsible for the establishment of the Gelug school and the founding of important monasteries such as the Ganden, Drepung, and Sera near Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. These institutions became central points for learning, meditation, and monkhood, attracting people from all over Tibet and Mongolia, thereby spreading the influence of the Gelug school. However, the history marked by a series of internal conflicts within the Phagmodrupa Dynasty and various political-religious factions eventually led to the rise of Rinpungpa, a minister family based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), who came to dominate politics after 1435. Their reign was succeeded by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse in 1565, which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades while showing favoritism towards the Karma Kagyu sect, another school of Tibetan Buddhism. Despite the political turmoil, the Gelug school has steadily continued to thrive in Tibet and is symbolized by the presence of the Yellow Hat, demonstrating the enduring influence of Je Tsongkhapa's disciples."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

The Department of Homeland Security ranked dead last again among federal agencies for overall employee satisfaction and commitment, with its score dropping to a historic low in the annual Best Places to Work in the Federal Government rankings. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson promised to make worker morale a top priority before his Senate confirmation last year. Let’s examine what he has done since taking office. Johnson and Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas created an employee steering committee focused on fairness in hiring and promotions, and they restarted a program that honors outstanding workers. Johnson handed out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 workers at a ceremony in October, drawing cheerful whoops from the crowd when he asked how their morale was doing. The agency said in a statement Tuesday that it has also invested more in training and professional development, in addition to building a communications platform that would “capture employees’ ideas effectively.” In this year’s Best Places rankings, Homeland Security finished last among large federal agencies for the third consecutive year as employee satisfaction and commitment dropped three points to 44 percent. The steepest decline occurred in the area of senior leadership. DHS said it is reviewing its programs for selecting and training executives to find out whether changes are needed. Since Johnson took office, the agency has also filled several key leadership vacancies, something management experts have long urged the agency to do. A recent exodus of DHS employees has exacerbated the agency’s leadership problems, with workers leaving the agency at nearly twice the rate of the federal government overall during the past four years, according to a Washington Post review of federal data. DHS’s efforts didn’t improve the agency’s score in this year’s Best Places rankings, but many of the initiatives are less than a year old at this point. Next year’s results may serve as a better measurement of Johnson’s effectiveness. Josh Hicks covers the federal government and anchors the Federal Eye blog. He reported for newspapers in the Detroit and Seattle suburbs before joining the Post as a contributor to Glenn Kessler’s Fact Checker blog in 2011. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Department of Homeland Security has ranked last among federal agencies for employee satisfaction and commitment, leading to the creation of an employee steering committee, increased investment in training and professional development, and a new communications platform to tackle the issue of low morale.

Abel's time (t_Abel) can be found using the formula distance = speed × time, which can be rearranged to time = distance / speed.

As she leaves 1 hour later, she has 1 hour less to travel the same distance: t_Alice from Abel's perspective = 1000 miles / 40 miles per hour = 25 hours Considering Alice leaves an hour later: t_Alice = 25 hours - 1 hour = 24 hours Now, let's find the difference in their arrival times in minutes: Difference = (t_Alice - t_Abel) × 60 minutes per hour Difference = (24 hours - 20 hours) × 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours × 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes So, Abel reaches the destination 240 minutes earlier than Alice."},{"instruction":"When the wagons come then what a difference!

Here is the segmented version: The sailor. Framed copies of Holbein's Great Dance of Death made by Janez Vajkard Valvasor. There's a larger version here: Sailor. The task seems unclear and a little confusing, but I believe the subject matter relates to a certain artwork. Perhaps, I can provide some background on the artist and the artwork. Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/1498 – 1543) was a German artist and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style. He is best known for his numerous portraits, particularly his series of portraits of King Henry VIII and his court. Holbein was highly sought after as a portrait painter and received many commissions from the nobility and the intellectual elite of his time. The \\"Great Dance of Death\\" is Holbein's masterpiece in the realm of woodcut prints. The Dance of Death (or Danse Macabre) is a medieval allegory about the universality of death. It represents the idea that regardless of one's station in life, death is inevitable and unites all human beings. Holbein's \\"Great Dance of Death\\" consists of a series of woodcut prints that portray a wide variety of people, from nobles and clergymen to peasants and beggars, all dancing with skeletons who represent death. These images serve as a powerful reminder of the transience of life and the equality of all in the face of death. Janez Vajkard Valvasor (1641 – 1693) was a Slovenian nobleman, polymath, and member of the Royal Society in London. He was a prolific author and his most famous work, \\"The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola,\\" is an encyclopedic account of the history, culture, and nature of the region that is now Slovenia. Valvasor was also a printmaker and may have produced framed copies of Holbein's \\"Great Dance of Death.\\" As per the given text, it seems that there might be another larger version of the artwork featuring a sailor that has been referenced. It is possible that this artwork could be Holbein's \\"Great Dance of Death\\" with a sailor as one of the characters engaged in the dance with death. In conclusion, the text appears to refer to framed copies of an artwork called the \\"Great Dance of Death\\" by Hans Holbein the Younger, possibly created or replicated by Janez Vajkard Valvasor. The larger version that is being referred to might be another artwork based on the same theme, but with a sailor as the central character."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Fortunately, the injury does not appear to be serious, and Johnson is expected to make a full recovery in time for the One Day International (ODI) tri-series. Meanwhile, Australian cricket team captain Michael Clarke has had to withdraw from the Test series against India due to his ongoing hamstring injury, but is actively working on his recovery in hopes of participating in the early stages of the World Cup. Mitchell Johnson, a key player in the Australian bowling line-up, has been experiencing some hamstring discomfort and has decided to skip the upcoming fourth Test match to ensure his performance remains uncompromised during the ODI tri-series. As Johnson's injury is not considered severe, it is believed that a period of rest and recuperation will be enough to resolve the issue and see him fit and ready for the next cricket event. On the other hand, Michael Clarke has not had such a smooth journey towards recovery. The Australian captain suffered a significant hamstring injury during the first Test against India, and ever since then, there has been a constant struggle to manage and rehabilitate it. Being ruled out of the Test series against India was a blow for both Clarke and the Australian team, but the focus has now shifted to ensure that the star player can make a strong and successful return to international cricket. Clarke's presence and contribution on the field are invaluable, and his recent update on his fitness progress was a sigh of relief for the fans and the team. In a statement, Clarke mentioned that he is currently \\"a week ahead of schedule\\" with his recovery, which brings hope that he will be able to return to play in the early stages of the prestigious World Cup event. However, rushing his recovery might be disastrous; taking a cautious approach while aiming to be fit as soon as possible seems to be the best course of action. Both Johnson's and Clarke's injuries underline the risk and strain that professional cricket can put on the athletes. Although they are examples of different severities and stages, their situations showcase the importance of proper injury management, timely intervention, and ensuring that the players receive optimal rest and medical support. In conclusion, Mitchell Johnson's absence from the fourth Test match due to hamstring issues appears to be a precautionary measure, and fans can expect to see him in action during the upcoming ODI tri-series. As for Michael Clarke, his road to recovery is ongoing, with the captain optimistically hoping to return to the field during the early stages of the World Cup.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What does Ryan let go of at the end of the film? Movie plot title: Up in the Air Movie plot: The opening credits roll over a montage of aerial shots of the ground as seen from an airplane in flight, as Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings sing \\"This Land Is Your Land.\\" The plane lands and we see a series of talking heads -- people who have just been fired. Their reactions run the gamut from incredulousness and sadness to anger, and are directed at Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is sitting calmly behind a desk. He works for CTC, Career Transition Counseling. In a voice-over, Ryan introduces himself: \\"I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss, who don't have the balls to sack their own employees.\\" There's a quick montage of retaliatory actions a disgruntled fired employee might engage in (pouring bleach in the coffee, sniper shooting), and we see Ryan offer a pat, sincere consolation to Steve, a fired employee.In a hotel room, experienced traveler Ryan expertly packs his suitcase. We see him drop off his rental car at an airport, bypassing the vacationers in the airport to check in at the frequent flyer desk, and powering through security with practiced moves as his voice-over lyrically describes the airport as his home. In first class, the stewardess asks him, \\"Cancer?\\" He looks at her quizzically. \\"Cancer?\\" He is confused, and she holds up a soft drink can, repeating, patiently: \\"Can, sir?\\" He shakes his head quickly and politely declines.Next, Ryan gives a motivational speech, \\"Unpacking Your Backpack,\\" where he admonishes a thin crowd in a nondescript hotel meeting room to consider how uncomplicated their lives would be if they didn't have responsibility for so many things: knick-knacks, photos, furniture, homes, and relationships. \\"Imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It's kinda exhilarating, isn't it?\\" The crowd is underwhelmed. Back at the airport, Ryan strides into a frequent flyer lounge flashing his membership card, where he is cheerfully greeted. He calls his office and talks to Kevin, an assistant, who tells him that he has been invited to appear at GoalQuest... Answer:","output":"The film \\"Up in the Air\\" does not provide specific information about what, if anything, the character Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney, lets go of by the end of the film within the given plot summary. However, based on the plot presented, it could be speculated that Ryan may let go of his impersonal and disconnected lifestyle. This possibility is implied in his job, where he fires people for a living, and in his motivational speech, \\"Unpacking Your Backpack\\". In his speech, he encourages listeners to imagine a life free of responsibilities, including possessions and personal relationships. Throughout the story, Ryan appears to embody this philosophy himself. He excels in navigating the impersonal world of airports, hotel rooms, and rental cars, and seems to prefer this transitory lifestyle over forming more permanent ties. The theme of \\"letting go\\" might, therefore, be symbolic of Ryan's journey of realizing the limitations and drawbacks of his isolation and potentially making changes towards forming more meaningful personal connections. This entire answer, however, is hypothesized from the plot described and may not accurately represent what happens in the film \\"Up in the Air\\" beyond the details presented in the plot summary."},{"instruction":"Located in Växjö and supply service in cooperation with the center in Staffanstorp, to customers in southern Sweden.

Question: Where were the Titans imprisoned? Title: Immortals Movie plot: When the world was young, the gods did battle in the sky. The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can. Phaedra tells Theseus he must return to his village and properly bury his mother. There, Theseus discovers the Bow of Epirus.

The details surrounding the incident are still being investigated, and authorities are working to understand the root cause of the crash. As of now, no other injuries or casualties have been reported in connection with the accident. The Fighter Pilot The late pilot was a symbol of strength and determination for women, not only in the aviation sector but also as a trailblazer for aspiring female officers in other fields. Throughout her time in the PAF, she had inspired countless individuals with her tenacity and dedication to her career and her country.

Her legacy will live on, not only within the hearts of her colleagues and the country she served but as an inspiration for the countless women following her path towards achieving greater gender equality in the aviation industry and beyond."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. Five dozens of people are attending your family reunion. Your family was assigned to bring the cans of soda. Each box of soda contains 10 cans and costs 2 per box. It was assumed that each person can consume 2 cans of soda. If you are six in the family and agreed to pay equally for the cost, how much will each of your family members pay?","output":"Step 1: Determine the total number of cans of soda needed for the event. There are 5 dozens of people attending the reunion. One dozen is equal to 12, so there are 5 * 12 = 60 people. Each person is assumed to consume 2 cans of soda. Therefore, the total number of cans of soda needed is 60 people * 2 cans = 120 cans. Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes of soda to be bought. Each box of soda contains 10 cans, and there are 120 cans needed. To find the number of boxes needed, divide the total number of cans by the number of cans per box: 120 cans / 10 cans/box = 12 boxes. Step 3: Compute the total cost of the soda. Each box of soda costs 2, and there are 12 boxes needed. To find the total cost, multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * 2/box = 24. Step 4: Determine the amount each family member will pay. There are six family members, and they all agreed to pay equally for the cost. To find how much each family member will pay, divide the total cost by the number of family members: 24 / 6 members = 4/member.

To understand its association with Cockney rhyming slang, we must first delve into the linguistic origins and cultural significance of Cockney rhyming slang. Cockney rhyming slang is a form of linguistic word play that originated in the East End of London during the 19th century. It involves replacing common words or phrases with alternative expressions that rhyme with the intended meaning, often composed in a whimsical or humorous manner. The origins of this practice are not exactly clear, but it is believed to have evolved as a means of communication among people belonging to the Cockney social class, allowing them to converse in a coded manner that was difficult for outsiders to understand. To relate the term \\"tomfoolery\\" to Cockney rhyming slang, we can consider the distinct components of the word and analyze any potential connections with slang phrases or underlying meanings. 1. \\"Tom\\" - This component may refer to a person's name, Tom, or it may be a shortened form of the word \\"tommy\\" or \\"tomfool.\\" \\"Tommy\\" has multiple meanings in Cockney rhyming slang. One possible reference is \\"Tommy Rotter,\\" which translates to \\"Potter\\" and is an abbreviation for \\"Harry Potter,\\" meaning \\"to plot\\" or \\"scheme.\\" Furthermore, \\"tomfool\\" denotes a foolish person, which connects to the overall meaning of \\"tomfoolery.\\" 2. \\"Foolery\\" - This component directly relates to the act of being foolish or engaging in absurd behavior. It is essential to note that the term \\"Fool\\" is used in many Cockney rhyming slang phrases, including \\"April Fool,\\" which rhymes with \\"stool,\\" and \\"bare-faced fool,\\" signifying a person who is easily deceived. Taking all of these factors into account, the term \\"tomfoolery\\" could potentially have associations with Cockney rhyming slang through the \\"Tommy Rotter\\" or \\"tomfool\\" part of the word. Nevertheless, in itself, \\"tomfoolery\\" is not strictly a Cockney rhyming slang phrase. Instead, it is a colloquial expression representing irresponsible, nonsensical, or mischievous behavior, which may indirectly relate to the playful and humorous nature of Cockney rhyming slang. The phrase emphasizes the eccentricity and vibrant culture of the Cockney-speaking community, as well as their penchant for using connotative, humorous language when discussing everyday matters."},{"instruction":"Q: A text is given in Gujarati.

An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","output":"George has a higher risk of hypertension."},{"instruction":"Background: Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Context: Recording sessions for the band's first album took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August 1962, but early on Brian lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Brian's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Brian fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production - though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit. In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The Surfin' U.S.A. album was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band. Brian was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the Surfer Girl album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Brian decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, Little Deuce Coupe, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the Surfer Girl LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Brian was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio. For much of the decade, Brian attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, \\"Surf City\\", which he co-wrote with Jan Berry of Jan and Dean, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Brian, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Brian's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by the Castells, Donna Loren, Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be the Honeys, which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with Phil Spector-led girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes. He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter--except for Jan and Dean. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article that demonstrate Brian Wilson's growth as a musician, his contributions to the music industry, and the impact of his personal circumstances on his work. 1. Innovativeness in music production: Brian Wilson's insistence on using different recording studios and techniques showcased his forward-thinking approach. He recognized that Capitol's basement studios, which were designed for larger orchestras, were not suitable for their rock band, leading to the decision to use United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. This proved beneficial, as the band found great success while recording in Hollywood. 2. Early adoption of double-tracking: Wilson made a significant decision to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. This technique contributed to the Beach Boys' distinct and influential sound. 3. Transition from surfing to car-oriented tunes: Though the Beach Boys initially found fame with their surfing songs, Wilson felt these tunes were limiting and decided to shift focus towards car-oriented music. This decision led to the creation of popular albums like Little Deuce Coupe, demonstrating Wilson's ability to adapt to changing music trends. 4. Challenges in working with other artists: Despite his successes with the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson faced challenges as a producer for other artists. His collaboration with Jan Berry on \\"Surf City\\" enraged Murry Wilson and Capitol Records, ultimately leading to the end of their partnership. Despite this, Wilson continued working with various artists throughout the 1960s, striving to recreate the success he experienced with the Beach Boys. 5. Impact of mental health and personal life on his work: Brian Wilson's lifelong struggles with mental health have been well-documented, and this article highlights the effect of his personal life on his career. The departure of guitarist David Marks forced Wilson to return to touring with the Beach Boys, reducing his availability in the recording studio. Additionally, conflicts with his father and record label affected his collaborations with other artists. Overall, this article sheds light on Brian Wilson's contributions to the music industry as an innovative composer and producer, as well as the personal challenges he faced throughout his career, which shaped the trajectory of both his own life and the Beach Boys' legacy."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Cocum, eatType = pub, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, familyFriendly = yes.

[D-Man2010] Answer:","output":"Upon their arrival at the local grocery store, the group of men who were preparing weapons for a fire fight found a group of people. The men from the car took over the store and appeared to be searching for someone in particular. One notable member of their group was scanning individuals by looking into their eyes. However, their operation wasn't unopposed. A cop managed to evade the raiders, succeed in shooting one of them - referred to as Spooky, who was the one scanning everyone - and call for backup, though he was eventually shot as well. The dead bodies, including that of the cop, were then moved back to the store's freezers where one of the raiders fired bullets into them. When the police finally arrived, the hostages who had been cleared were released, whereas the uncleared ones were cornered in the back and forced to drink milk. It was revealed at this point that the raiders were actually a group of scientists, tracking an unknown contagion to the town and more specifically, to the supermarket. Since the individual nicknamed Spooky was dead, an alternate method had to be used to find out who was infected. The group started with the supermarket's boss, asking him questions as a distraction technique to cut one of his fingers. While this was happening, the boss attempted to escape and disclosed that he had stolen money from the store. Meanwhile, the remaining hostages initiated a plan to escape. One of them went into the freezer to retrieve a gun, but was killed by an unidentified person who was later revealed in the film to be an alien king.

The Catalan language, a Romance language spoken primarily in the Catalonia region of Spain, the Balearic Islands, and the Valencia region, has a rich history and diverse influences that have shaped its development over time. In order to understand its origin and evolution, we can break down the process into a few key stages. 1. Pre-Roman period: Before the arrival of the Romans, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by various pre-Roman tribes, among which the Iberians and the Celts were the most prominent. The native Iberian languages at this time were not related to the Romance languages, but they did leave some influences on the development of future languages in the region, such as the place names or the word formations. 2. Romanization: In the second century BCE, the Iberian Peninsula was incorporated into the Roman Empire. Latin was progressively introduced as the administration and commerce language, gradually replacing the native Iberian languages. During this period, the Latin spoken in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula began to differentiate from the Latin spoken elsewhere, as the local population adopted the new language and adapted it to their Iberian or Celtic linguistic background. 3. Proto-Romance period: With the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, the Iberian Peninsula experienced a series of invasions, including Visigoths and other Germanic tribes. These cultural influences introduced some new vocabulary and phonetic changes, promoting further linguistic differentiation from classical Latin. 4. Emergence of Old Catalan: With the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the early eighth century, Arabic became the dominant language in the southern and central regions. In the northern and eastern regions, there were some degree of contact with Arabic, but it was also during this period that a distinctively Catalan language began to form from its Latin roots. Some historical documents from this period, including the Glosas Emilianenses and Glosas Silenses, may contain early examples of Proto-Catalan. 5. Medieval expansion: During the Reconquista – the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula – Catalan started to be used more widely in legal, administration, and literary domains. As the Crown of Aragon expanded its territory to the Kingdom of Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and beyond the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan grew as the official language of administration and trade. 6. Standardization and influence of other Romance languages: Through the Middle Ages and early modern period, Catalan literature developed extensively, as seen in the works of Ramon Llull, Ausiàs March, and Tirant lo Blanch. It was also the period when the language started to be standardized, and Catalan scholars and writers looked to other Romance languages, such as Old Occitan and Old French, for sources of inspiration in refining their language. 7. Decline and resurgence: In the early modern period, Spanish started to replace Catalan as the official language in many aspects, leading to a decline in the use and prestige of Catalan. However, a resurgence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the Renaixença, a cultural movement that sought to revive and promote Catalan identity, led to a renaissance in Catalan literature and language. Today, Catalan is spoken by around 10 million people and is the co-official language in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands, as well as being recognized as a minority language in other territories. It holds a unique place among the Romance languages, exhibiting similarities with its sister languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian while retaining its distinct characteristics."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: Which character dies?

Currently, there is no evidence showing that these work and none of these products are approved by the government. Many tanning salons sell these products. Resist the sales pitch and, if you have to try the products, pick up cheap versions from any general store. After sweating so much, you’ll feel gross, but wait an hour before jumping in the shower. While an immediate shower won’t ruin your session, it will wash off any products you applied and slow the spread of the tan. Hot water does this too, so keep the temperature low. Rub a moisturizer into your skin at least once a day every day. This will keep your skin smooth and elastic, so your tan won’t fade as fast as it normally would. Avoid oil-based moisturizers since they make your tan look worse. Read the moisturizer’s label to find out if it is oil-based. once a week with a brush or sponge. Get a body brush or exfoliating sponge and use it to scrub away old skin cells. Be very gentle, since you don’t want to wear away your tan. Take care of any rough or patchy spots that cloud your tan and keep the tanning bed light from sinking in evenly. Without water, your skin flakes more and loses its glow. Keep a water bottle on hand and reach for it whenever you’re thirsty. Have some water after tanning to replace what you sweat out. Not only is sunburn painful, but it leaves your skin vulnerable to bigger health concerns like cancer. Also watch the moles on your skin for any changes in size or color. Go to a doctor if you feel sick or notice any lumps on your skin.

Introduction: Bankers have traditionally been compensated in various ways, including salaries, annual bonuses, stock options, and other performance-based rewards. With the increasing public scrutiny over excessive bonus payments and the growing interest in aligning compensation with long-term, responsible performance, the idea of paying bankers in bonds has gained traction. This article explores the concept of bond-based compensation for bankers and weighs its potential risks and benefits. Step 1: Understanding Bond-Based Compensation Paying bankers in bonds means compensating them at least partially in the form of long-term debt instruments rather than traditional cash bonuses or stock options. The goal of this approach is to encourage responsible risk-taking, reducing the likelihood of situations like the financial crisis of 2008, where short-term profit maximization by some financial institutions led to significant losses for investors and taxpayers. Step 2: Analyzing the Advantages 1. Aligns interests with long-term financial stability: Bond-based compensation can incentivize bankers to make decisions that prioritize a bank's long-term success rather than just short-term profits. This can lead to more sustainable growth and reduce the chance of crises caused by short-sighted risk-taking. 2. Reduces excessive risk-taking: Paying bankers in bonds can motivate them to avoid high-risk investments that could jeopardize their payouts. Bonds are a more conservative investment vehicle, being less volatile than stocks and usually offering a fixed-income over time. This risk-averse profile can help to instill a culture of responsible investing in the banking industry. 3. Encourages better compliance and ethical practices: As bankers are directly financially tied to the bank's success, they will be more inclined to ensure they adhere to regulations, minimize conduct risk, and maintain good relationships with regulators and stakeholders. Step 3: Considering Potential Drawbacks 1. Attractiveness to top talent: It may be more challenging for banks to attract top talent if their compensation packages are perceived as less competitive than those of their peers. Talented bankers might prefer to work for institutions that offer traditional cash bonuses or stock-based compensation, which are often seen as more attractive and lucrative opportunities. 2. Motivation for short-term gains: Bankers paid in bonds might still find ways to boost short-term profits or manipulate performance metrics that determine their bonuses. This could undermine the intended goal of promoting long-term stability and responsible decision-making. 3. The behavior of bondholders: It could be argued that bondholders are not always focused on long-term financial stability. During times of financial stress, bondholders may be motivated to sell particular bonds, which could depress bond prices and lead to unintended market disruptions. Conclusion: Paying bankers in bonds is an approach worth considering for aligning banker interests with long-term financial stability and reducing excessive risk-taking. However, it is essential to be aware of potential drawbacks, such as the challenge of attracting top talent and the possibility of still fostering short-term profit maximization. Banks should carefully weigh the pros and cons of bond-based compensation and work towards creating a compensation structure that achieves a balance between financial stability and competitiveness in the market."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Above the Veil, followedBy, Into Battle (novel).

The Legion was completely defeated, to Rome's embarrassment, and the Legion's prized standard, a golden eagle, captured. Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum) is the son of the Legion's General, and is determined to exonerate his father and the family name. Choosing Britain for his first active station, he must prove himself to his men when local Barbarian tribes, led by an angry Druid, attack the fort at night.Marcus senses the attack and wakes his men in time. They fight the intruders and win the battle, but the next day the Druid returns with prisoners of war - an expedition Marcus had sent out to find a grain convoy. The leader of the expedition is beheaded before their eyes.Unwilling to bear the guilt of his men's death, Marcus leads the best of his men out of the fort. Using their shields and proven Roman infantry battle tactics, they push back the Celts and defend the prisoners. They have started moving back to the fort when the Druid summons his chariots, which race forward with scythes on the wheels and hack down the retreating men. Marcus grabs a spear, steadies his aim, and launches it toward the Druid. The spear kills the driver, causing the chariot to topple onto Marcus.With his leg badly injured, Marcus is sent to his Uncle (Donald Sutherland)'s house to recover.

Jordanian demonstrators are calling for the election of the prime minister by popular vote, want to see corruption seriously tackled and unemployment - which tops 13% - alleviated. Protests here have been smaller and mainly peaceful, with no calls for the king to be removed. The king has responded by establishing a national dialogue committee tasked with amending the constitution to give the public greater political say. Last week, the absolute monarch also unveiled a new system to select future cabinets. Starting next year he will involve parliament in forming cabinets until prime ministers can be popularly elected. The king also wants to see Jordan's 33 political parties merge into political groupings such as left, right and centre from which a prime minister can emerge. He has said this process could take up to three years. But independent analyst Labib Kamhawi called this tinkering with the system as a \\"waste of time\\". \\"There is no need to establish such a mechanism. Parliamentary governments are well-defined,\\" he said. \\"The problem lies in the system which prohibits political parties from taking their lawful share in parliament by manipulating the process itself by rigging elections.\\" Political observers and members of the opposition, including the powerful Islamic Action Front (IAF), allege that widespread election fraud took place during the last two parliamentary elections. The IAF, which is affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood, said they were deprived of votes in the 2007 elections and boycotted the 2010 polls as a result. Mr Kamhawi and other analysts such as University of Jordan international relations professor Hassan Barari accuse Jordan's all-pervasive security services, special interest groups and members of the ruling elite of undermining the drive for reform in the country. \\"The ruling elite, by this I mean the bureaucracy, corrupt politicians and businessmen, have no interest in giving people genuine reforms,\\" Mr Barari said. \\"The king has realised that the status quo is untenable and swift moves to contain the street are needed. That's why he started constitutional amendments, some political reforms and firing the weakest government in a decade.\\" On 17 October, the unpopular Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit stepped down a day after 70 out of 120 parliamentarians called for him to go. A tough ex-army general, Mr Bakhit was viewed as incapable of enacting needed reforms and his time in office had been tainted by charges of corruption. The king appointed the respected jurist and former deputy of the Hague-based International Court of Justice, Awn al-Khasawneh, as the third prime minister to take the job since protests broke out in January. Mr Khasawneh's government is the tenth since Abdullah ascended the throne in 1999. This turnover is pretty much traditional in Jordan. The king's father, King Hussein, also changed cabinets about every eight months during his reign. Mr Barari of the University of Jordan said the king cannot keep prime ministers in office for a longer time because people in the street would \\"explode\\". The prime ministers deflect criticism and work as a \\"buffer\\", while the monarch is viewed as responding to people's demands for change. Observers also criticised some of the king's past choices for the post and said the endless cycle of cabinet reshuffles should be broken. \\"Parliament should select a prime minister and cabinet. A government should be the outcome of political balances within parliament,\\" said Mr Barari. \\"A good electoral law and no state interference in elections are required. Let the people decide who their representatives are. Parliament will then appoint the prime minister,\\" he added. Prime Minister Khasawneh has announced that \\"there will be no more rigged elections\\" in Jordan. \\"The country will not tolerate any more manipulation in any future elections.\\" How will this be accomplished? He said the government will set up an independent organisation to oversee municipal and parliamentary elections. But the fact that the government is once again involved would seem to undermine the independence of the monitoring group. Shadi Hamid and Courtney Freer of the Brookings Center in Doha called the king's tactic of replacing his prime ministers as a means to \\"demonstrate his seriousness about change\\". But they also said the Jordanian monarchy has a \\"long history of pledging reform yet failing to deliver, beginning in 1989 with an initially promising but soon aborted democratic experiment\\". King Abdullah recently urged parliamentarians to devise a political parties' law and amend a controversial election bill, which Islamist and other opposition claim has provided pro-monarchy landslide victories and produced weak parliaments. While these measures are necessary to the political reform process, Mr Kamhawi still faults the powers that be with delays to realising true democratic transformation in Jordan. \\"At the end of the day, it boils down to what compromise the king is willing to live with. It seems to be that we have not yet reached that point,\\" he said. And Shadi Hamid and Courtney Freer argue that while King Abdullah is often seen to be above the political fray he, \\"like all dominant monarchs, is at least partly responsible for the stagnation of political reform in Jordan\\". For the first time in decades, youth, Islamist and leftist opposition protesters are challenging the monarchy's grip on power. Analysts are warning that although deference to the king persists, it may not last forever. Summary:","output":"Since January, street protesters in Jordan have been demanding political changes, including the election of the prime minister by popular vote, addressing corruption and alleviating unemployment, which is currently over 13%. The relatively peaceful protests have not called for the removal of the king, who has responded by forming a national dialogue committee to amend the constitution and give the public greater political influence. However, political analysts are skeptical about the feasibility of these changes, with concerns about election fraud and manipulation of the process by special interest groups and members of the ruling elite. These issues are seen as undermining the reform efforts and causing a delay in true democratic transformation. As protests continue to challenge the monarchy's grip on power, analysts warn that public support for the king might not last indefinitely unless real reforms are enacted."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: it is not possible to tell","output":"Question: Is it possible to determine the exact number of species living in the depths of the ocean?

Human technology has only allowed us to reach certain depths, which means there is still a significant portion of the ocean that has not yet been discovered. Furthermore, new species are constantly being discovered, some of which are adapted to specific environmental conditions and extreme pressures at great depths, making the task of identifying and cataloging these species incredibly difficult. Also, some species can be small, elusive, or have a short life span making them even harder to find and study. Various factors such as climate change, ocean pollution, and other anthropogenic activities may also lead to changes in the distribution and adaptation of species, potentially leading to undiscovered extinctions or new species development.

David Cameron has pledged to support women who stay at home to raise children, fuelling hopes that he will act on his promise to recognise marriage in the tax system. The Prime Minister has come under fire from stay-at-home mothers after excluding them from new childcare plans. He was also criticised for stopping child benefit for families living off a single salary at a lower income level than those with two wage earners. But he denied ministers were trying to force mothers back to work. Mr Cameron also signalled that he was preparing to dilute controversial plans to increase the number of children a childminder can look after, following opposition from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg. The Prime Minister said he did not agree with Business Secretary Vince Cable that there was ‘prejudice’ against stay-at-home mothers. He added: ‘I support the choices mums make. If they want to work we should support that, and if they want to stay at home we should support that. The idea is not to dictate to people what they should do, but to support the choices they make. ‘There are lots of things we do that help stay-at-home mums. The support we’re giving for nursery education is a good example.’ His words will encourage Tory MPs and ministers who are lobbying him to fulfil his promise to create a marriage tax break. Speculation is mounting that George Osborne may bring in a modest tax break in his autumn statement. But some Tories believe it will come too late to take effect before the next election in 2015. The Prime Minister also suggested he was willing to compromise over the Coalition’s childcare plans after Mr Clegg withdrew his support at the last moment. Ministers were planning to relax the rules on the number of children childminders and nursery staff can care for. But in a late change of heart this month, Mr Clegg said he had serious concerns about the plans, which would allow nursery staff to look after six two-year-olds. Nick Clegg withdrew his support for the Coalition's childcare plans at the last moment following a call in to his LBC Radio by campaigner Laura Perrins. Laura Perrins told Clegg many families felt discriminated against by a £1,200 tax break. This enraged Education Secretary Michael. Gove, who accused Mr Clegg of blocking the plans to bolster his. position as Lib Dem leader. Mr Clegg’s U-turn followed an embarrassing phone-in on his LBC radio show in March, when he was harangued by barrister and mother-of-two Laura Perrins. The 32-year-old, who gave up her legal career to look after her children, told him many traditional families felt discriminated against by the announcement that working parents only would receive a tax break of up to £1,200 per year to cover soaring childcare costs. Mrs Perrins, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’. Yesterday, Mr Cameron said it was pointless getting frustrated with Mr Clegg’s change of tack, adding: ‘Trying to get quality affordable childcare is a priority for the Government. The proposals we put forward had a lot of merit. ‘Clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the Coalition about how best to go forward. ‘There’s no point getting too frustrated. We’ll find a way forward that I hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare.’ From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would also be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. The ratio for three-year-olds would remain unchanged. Tory sources claim this would cut nursery costs by around £1,300 a year without compromising quality. But the plans were criticised by childminders and mothers.

The big segment concerned professional sports stadiums—mainly, how sports franchises are ripping off the public by financing their souped-up arenas with billions of dollars in taxpayer money even though the franchises themselves are profitable, they’re owned by billionaires, and they don’t boost the economy of their host city. But prior to that 19-minute investigation, Oliver aired his “And Now This” segment, and this week’s was titled, “Whoopi Goldberg Defends Ten Surprising Things.” The montage of clips was no doubt pegged to Goldberg’s continued defense of accused serial rapist Bill Cosby. Goldberg has arguably been Cosby’s most vocal supporter not named Camille throughout this horrifying ordeal in which over 40 women over the years 1965-2008 have accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them. Last week, the Associated Press published unsealed Cosby testimony from a 2005 civil suit wherein the comedian admitted to the following: drugging a 19-year-old woman for the purpose of sex; obtaining seven prescriptions for Quaaludes to administer to women for the purpose of sex; asking his agent at William Morris to pay off a woman “no questions asked”; and offering to pay for one of his rape accusers’ educations when she and her mother asked him for an apology. Despite this eye-opening reveal, Goldberg lowered her head and soldiered on in her defense of Cosby, saying she “doesn’t like snap judgments,” “he has not been proven a rapist,” and cracking dismissive jokes about how “the ‘80s weren’t fun for everybody, clearly.” So Oliver, as is his wont, thoroughly embarrassed Goldberg with a supercut of things she’s defended—mostly while serving as co-host of daytime talk show The View—including Roman Polanski (“I don’t believe it was rape-rape”); Ray Rice (“If you hit somebody, you cannot be sure you are not going to get hit back”); CIA torture (“There are other countries that have done it, and it’s reaped quite the benefits for them”); the list goes on.Watch it here: ||||| Whoopi Goldberg in April 2015. (Photo: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP) Bill Cosby's last prominent public supporter, Whoopi Goldberg, dramatically changed her mind on Tuesday. After taking intense heat for defending him as \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" of allegations he raped and drugged dozens of women over decades, Goldberg concluded on The View that there is no legal way to prove his guilt. Therefore, she said, he can only be tried in the court of public opinion, as is happening at the moment. \\"And I gotta say all the information out there kind of points to guilt,\\" she said. \\"I can't say anymore, 'innocent until proven guilty' because there's no way to prove it. \\"It looks bad, Bill,\\" she said, addressing Cosby. The Wrap had the video. Goldberg, who says she's gotten death threats for her stance up to now on Cosby, brought on ABC legal analyst Dan Abrams to discuss Cosby, interviewing him about how the criminal justice system handles rape allegations and state statutes of limitation. “I’ve got to say, all of the information that’s out there kind of points to guilt.” -@WhoopiGoldberg on #BillCosbypic.twitter.com/X1cWNfEJHz — The View (@TheView) July 14, 2015 Someone is innocent until proven guilty in the U.S. justice system, but this only applies when someone is arrested, charged and is tried, Abrams said. That hasn't happened with Cosby and probably won't because the allegations against him are so old they fall outside the statutes of limitation.

Goldberg said she now understands better that under the current legal system, the women who have accused Cosby have no other recourse except to do what they are doing — attempt to try him in the media. \\"There's nothing that can be done legally,\\" Goldberg said. \\"All that's left is the court of public opinion.\\" But, she added, it would have been better for all of the accusers if they had come forward earlier. Some of the women say they were sexually assaulted by Cosby in the 1960s. \\"I say to women, if something happens, don't wait because it can make it harder to prove your case later,\\" she said. Director Judd Apatow has been almost as critical of Goldberg as he has of the accused Cosby, imploring her in public to believe the accusers. Comedian John Oliver last week attacked Goldberg, comparing her defense of Cosby to defending torture or Mel Gibson. So far, neither has tweeted a reaction to Goldberg's 180. Goldberg was not alone in switching sides. Joseph C. Phillips, the actor who played Cosby's son-in-law on The Cosby Show, parted ways with some of his fellow castmembers (such as Phylicia Rashad) in declaring on his website that he thinks Cosby is guilty even though he still loves him. \\"Honestly, that phrase may not be enough to sufficiently describe my feelings for Bill. He was my boyhood idol. His influence on my life has been profound. I owe much of who I am to Bill Cosby,\\" wrote Phillips, who describes himself on Twitter as a Christian conservative. But he was persuaded of Cosby's guilt when a mutual old friend tearfully told him she had been assaulted by Cosby. Phillips said he was not prepared to dismiss Cosby's brilliance or his legacy, but he had some advice for the man he still admires. \\"Bill, you have a family who loves you, a wife who is devoted to you; you have more money than you can spend. Please, go live a quiet country life. Allow those of us who truly love you to preserve just a bit of our enchantment.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1IYf20Q ||||| Whoopi Goldberg admitted that the evidence against comedian Bill Cosby is overwhelming on Tuesday’s episode of “The View,” with the comedian saying, “If this is to be tried in the court of public opinion, I got to say all of the information that’s out there kind of points to guilt.” As recently as last week, Goldberg maintained that Cosby should be considered innocent until proven guilty. But during a discussion with ABC News’ chief legal analyst Dan Abrams, he explained that there is virtually no legal recourse at this point for Cosby’s accusers as the statute of limitations has expired for them to press criminal charges.

If you want to get an ass– bonehead off the street, if you want to get him off the street, we need you to step out and if you step out then he can be put away.” “You got a serial rapist, he’s been on the streets for 30 years,” Goldberg continued. “I have to say I thought that, ‘Yeah, here’s all the information, take his ass to jail. I find out from you that that’s not possible. So I can’t say any more ‘innocent until proven guilty’ because there’s no way to prove it.” Also Read: The Fall of Bill Cosby: A Timeline of His Descent From Beloved 'Superstar' to Accused Sex Offender Both Abrams and Goldberg encouraged people to write to their legislators to reform state rape statutes. “You say to your legislators, ‘Rape is a crime that shouldn’t have a statute of limitations.

They shouldn’t be forced into a particular time frame,'” Abrams said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"John Oliver recently discussed the case of Bill Cosby on his HBO series Last Week Tonight, focusing on Whoopi Goldberg's defense of Cosby amidst allegations of sexual assault.

Answer: Lighting plays a crucial role in both residential and commercial settings as it not only illuminates spaces but also influences ambience, mood, and functionality. There are four primary types of lighting available, namely general (ambient), task, accent, and decorative lighting. Each type serves a specific purpose, and their thoughtful combination can have a transformative impact on a space. 1. General (Ambient) Lighting: General or ambient lighting provides overall illumination for a room or area. It sets the baseline for the brightness and ensures an adequate level of visibility and comfort. In residential settings, this type of lighting is commonly found in living rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms. In commercial spaces like offices or retail stores, ambient lighting is essential for maintaining a safe and efficient work environment. General lighting is often achieved through fixtures such as recessed or surface-mounted lights, chandeliers, pendant lights, or floor and table lamps. To create a welcoming atmosphere and make the space feel larger, soft and diffused light should be used. 2. Task Lighting: This lighting type is designed to provide focused and bright illumination for specific tasks or activities such as reading, cooking, working at a desk, or dressing up. Task lighting benefits both residential and commercial spaces by boosting productivity and reducing eye strain. It is crucial for areas that demand detailed work like kitchens, offices, workshops, and studios. Examples of task lighting fixtures include desk lamps, under-cabinet lights, pendant lights above countertops or workstations, and vanity lights in dressing areas or bathrooms. 3. Accent Lighting: Accent lighting is used to highlight specific features or architectural elements within a space, such as artwork, unique textures, or interior design elements. This type of lighting creates visual interest, adds layers to a room's atmosphere, and guides the viewer's gaze. Accent lighting is prevalent in gallery spaces, museums, restaurants, and hotels but can also be applied to residential contexts. Common fixtures for accent lighting include track lights, wall sconces, and directional recessed lights. 4. Decorative Lighting: While primarily serving as aesthetic elements, decorative lighting fixtures contribute to the overall lighting in a space. They often embody a unique design that makes them a focal point, assisting in the creation of a room's atmosphere and style. Examples include chandeliers, wall sconces with intricate patterns, and statement pendant lights. Decorative lighting is particularly useful for enhancing or defining the look and feel of residential spaces, while commercial applications often use it to make a memorable impression in areas such as hotel lobbies and upscale retail establishments. In conclusion, understanding the different types of lighting and their appropriate usage is essential in achieving a well-balanced, functional, and attractive space. For optimal results, these lighting types should be combined, layering general, task, accent, and decorative lighting to create depth, ambiance, and versatility in both residential and commercial environments. Additionally, utilizing energy-efficient and smart lighting options can increase energy savings while allowing for greater customization to fit various activities and moods."},{"instruction":"How to make a green candy buffet<br>Select suitable containers for the candies.

Question 2: How does the stock market work? Who decides the price of stocks? Possible answers: 1). no; 2). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"The two questions are related but not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking for a definition or explanation of what the stock market is, while Question 2 is asking for details on the functioning of the stock market, particularly relating to stock prices. Below are detailed answers to each question. Question 1: What is the stock market? The Stock market is a public marketplace where stocks, also known as shares or equities, can be bought and sold. These stocks represent ownership or a claim on part of a company's assets and earnings. The stock market serves as a platform that brings together investors who wish to buy shares and those who wish to sell them. The stock market is an essential component of a capitalistic economy, enabling companies to raise capital to invest in their growth and development. It also allows investors to grow their wealth by participating in the ownership and success of corporations. Major stock markets around the world include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), and others. These stock exchanges have specific rules and regulations, as well as listing and membership requirements for the companies and securities being traded. Question 2: How does the stock market work? Who decides the price of stocks? The stock market operates through a network of exchanges, each with their buying and selling systems. The price of stocks is determined by the supply and demand for them in the marketplace. Various factors influence the demand for a company's stock, including the company's performance, industry trends, global economic conditions, investor sentiment, and market forces. For a trade to occur, a buyer and a seller need to agree on a price. When a potential buyer submits a buy order, they provide a maximum price they are willing to pay and the desired number of shares, known as the bid price. On the other hand, a potential seller submits a sell order with a minimum acceptable price and the number of shares they are willing to sell, known as the ask price. When there is a matching bid and ask price, the trade takes place. Most stock exchanges use electronic trading systems, which enable orders to be executed quickly and efficiently. Notably, stock prices often fluctuate throughout the trading day due to market dynamics and changes in investor sentiment. Apart from market forces, there are also situations when an initial stock price is set. One instance is during an initial public offering (IPO). In this case, the company going public and its underwriters work together to determine the initial price of the stock. The price is based on various factors, including the company's financials, market conditions, industry trends, and investor demand. In conclusion, Question 1 and Question 2 are related, but they address different aspects of the stock market. The first question pertains to the definition of the stock market, while the second question explores its operations and the factors that influence stock prices."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia .

Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. A three-year-old, from Mornington Peninsula - south-east of Melbourne, allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk, the Herald Sun reports. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones said the company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Scroll down for video. A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk. Ms Jones said the company labelled their milk with non-consumption warnings in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' Meanwhile, four children from Melbourne, aged one to four, have been struck down with serious illnesses such as gastroenteritis after drinking different brands of raw milk. The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and it's packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester says raw milk, which is marketed as bath milk, can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea if consumed. 'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner. Dr Rosemary Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only.

Mountain View Farm, the company behind the product, states that it always advises people not to drink the milk, and is willing to add extra warnings and comply with regulations. 5. Four children from Melbourne, aged 1 to 4, suffered from serious illnesses, such as gastroenteritis, after consuming different brands of raw milk. 6. Raw milk is believed by some to be healthier, more nutritious, and easier to digest than processed milk, which has led to an increase in its popularity. 7. Dr. Rosemary Lester, from Victoria's Department of Health, issued a warning about the dangers of consuming raw milk, stating that it can cause illness, particularly for vulnerable populations such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with compromised health. 8. Consumer Affairs Victoria, along with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), will review the marketing of raw milk and assess whether it breaches consumer laws. 9. The packaging of raw milk products is often very similar to regular milk products, increasing the risk of confusion and accidental consumption. 10. The department has limited power to recall these products as they are classified as cosmetic and marked 'not for human consumption.' 11. Health officials emphasize that unpasteurized milk should not be consumed due to the potential health risks it poses."},{"instruction":"If x is an odd integer, which of the following is an odd integer? Options: (A) 2x (B) 3x-1 (C) 5x+6 (D) x+x^2 (E) 6x-6 Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","output":"To determine which of the given options results in an odd integer when x is an odd integer, let me first explain the properties of odd and even integers. An odd integer is any integer of the form (2n + 1), where n is an integer. An even integer is any integer of the form (2n), where n is an integer. Now, let's analyze each option: (A) 2x: If x = 2n + 1 (an odd integer), then 2x = 2(2n + 1) = 4n + 2 = 2(2n + 1), which is an even integer by definition. (B) 3x - 1: If x = 2n + 1, then 3x - 1 = 3(2n + 1) - 1 = 6n + 3 - 1 = 6n + 2 = 2(3n + 1), which is also an even integer by definition. (C) 5x + 6: If x = 2n + 1, then 5x + 6 = 5(2n + 1) + 6 = 10n + 5 + 6 = 10n + 11, which is an odd integer, as it has the form (2n + 1). (D) x + x^2: If x = 2n + 1, then x^2 = (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1. When you add x and x^2, you have (2n + 1) + (4n^2 + 4n + 1) = 4n^2 + 6n + 2 = 2(2n^2 + 3n + 1), which is an even integer by definition. (E) 6x - 6: If x = 2n + 1, then 6x - 6 = 6(2n + 1) - 6 = 12n + 6 - 6 = 12n, which is an even integer by definition, as it has the form (2n). In conclusion, when x is an odd integer, only option (C) 5x + 6 results in an odd integer."},{"instruction":"- Fill the tray with cool water - Place the tray in the freezer - Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - Take they tray out of the freezer - Pop the ice cubes out of tray.

As such, it is crucial to seek a doctor's advice when certain complications arise. Depending on the severity of the problem, your doctor may recommend various treatment options, including foot exercises and surgery. In this article, we will explore the importance of seeking professional help for foot complications, the process of making a doctor's appointment, the benefits of foot exercises, and the role of surgery in treating foot-related issues. Step 1: Seek a doctor's advice when complications arise Foot problems might be a result of an acute injury, chronic conditions, inadequate footwear, or a combination of factors. If you experience persistent pain, swelling, numbness, or any unusual sensations in your feet, it is essential to consult a medical professional. A doctor can evaluate the cause of your discomfort and suggest an appropriate treatment plan to address the issue. Justifying this step ensures that you receive proper care and prevent further complications. Step 2: Make an appointment with your doctor Once you have recognized the need for a consultation, make an appointment with your primary care physician or a podiatrist, who specializes in foot care. When scheduling your visit, provide a brief overview of your symptoms, so the medical staff can allocate sufficient time to examine and diagnose your specific concerns. This step is vital to ensure that your doctor has a clear understanding of your issue before meeting with you in person, thus leading to a more effective and targeted treatment plan. Step 3: Follow advice on foot exercises Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may recommend foot exercises as part of your treatment plan. These exercises can help strengthen the muscles in your feet and ankles, improve flexibility and balance, and relieve pain and discomfort. Adhering to your doctor's advice on foot exercises is crucial, as it can significantly enhance your recovery and contribute to maintaining healthy feet in the long run. Remember to perform these exercises consistently and in the proper manner to reap the maximum benefits. Step 4: Consider surgery, if necessary In some cases, foot complications may require surgical intervention. Your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of undergoing surgery and help you determine if this is the best course of action for your specific situation. Surgery may be recommended to address issues such as severe bunions, hammertoes, or Achilles tendon ruptures. Following through with the recommended surgical treatment when necessary can be life-changing, eliminating pain and improving mobility and overall quality of life. Conclusion Addressing foot complications in a timely and proactive manner is crucial for your wellbeing. Seeking medical advice ensures that you receive appropriate treatment, based on the expertise of a professional. By following your doctor's guidance, committing to therapeutic exercises, and considering surgical options when necessary, you can overcome foot-related issues and return to a healthy, active lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: It was always hard to get things in focus (but when you shoot f1.4 it's usually harder) still I felt the lens's focus system is not the best. Then after a while it just stopped responding well it only focuses well when I'm close to the subject and the background has a weird radial blur that didn't have before.Great lense, if it worked. Answer: Options: (A). No. (B). Yes. The answer is:","output":"(A). No. Based on the given review, it is evident that the user would not recommend this product. The user has described several issues while using the lens which ultimately led to a negative experience. Firstly, they mention having difficulty in getting things in focus, even while acknowledging the inherent challenges of using a fast lens with a wide aperture (such as an f1.4 lens). This suggests that the user encountered more difficulties with the autofocus system than they would typically expect or consider normal, which detracts from their satisfaction with the product. Secondly, the user states that the lens \\"stopped responding well\\", meaning that they began to experience issues with the focus, particularly in situations requiring focus on subjects that are close and backgrounds that exhibit a radial blur. This problem appears to be an additional concern, and the reviewer expresses frustration as it wasn't present initially. Moreover, the user phrases their description by saying \\"Great lense, if it worked\\", implying that the issues mentioned undermined the product's overall performance and their satisfaction as a user. Taken together, these issues demonstrate that the user is not happy with the product's performance, primarily due to focusing difficulties and the subsequent decline in functionality over time. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that the user would not recommend this product to others."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Sharpen a pencil on a rough concrete surface..

Rotate the pencil in your and and repeat until pencil point is formed.. 2). Hold the pencil in one hand and angle the pencil to the side walk surface. Make the angle about thirty degrees. Apply mineral oil to the side walk, then, move the pencil back and forth until the wood is worn away a little. Rotate the pencil in your and and repeat until pencil point is formed..","output":"Between the two options provided, Option 1 is the better solution for sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface. This option involves holding the pencil at an approximately thirty-degree angle and moving it back and forth on the rough surface to wear away the wood. Rotating the pencil in your hand at regular intervals ensures an even grind and ultimately forms a sharpened pencil point. There are several reasons why Option 1 is a better solution than Option 2: 1. Simplicity: Option 1 is a simpler method of sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface as it requires no additional materials or substances like mineral oil in Option 2. The straightforward action of rubbing the pencil against the concrete surface will wear away the wood, revealing the graphite core and creating a point. 2. Availability of materials: In Option 1, you only need a pencil and concrete surface to execute the process, whereas, in Option 2, you also need mineral oil. It might not always be possible to find mineral oil readily available in various situations, making Option 1 more practical in most cases. 3. Safety concerns: Applying mineral oil to a concrete surface, as suggested in Option 2, could create a slippery and dangerous situation for anyone walking on or near the oiled area. It would also leave an oily residue on the sidewalk, which could be harmful to the environment. 4. Mess: Option 2 would create a mess due to the application of oil on the sidewalk, making it a less desirable choice. Option 1, on the other hand, will only produce a small amount of wood shavings that can be easily swept away or blown off the surface by wind. 5. Effectiveness: Option 1 would be just as effective, if not more effective, than Option 2. Rubbing the pencil against the rough surface of concrete without any lubrication will effectively wear away the wood and create a sharp point. The added mineral oil in Option 2 may actually hinder the sharpening process as it could potentially reduce the friction between the pencil and the concrete surface, thereby decreasing its effectiveness. In conclusion, Option 1 is a superior choice for sharpening a pencil on a rough concrete surface because it is simpler, relies on readily available materials, avoids potential safety hazards, generates less mess, and remains effective for the task at hand."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Strada, food = Chinese, customer rating = 3 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes, near = Rainbow Vegetarian Café Sentence:","output":"Strada is a family-friendly Chinese food place, with a 3 out of 5 star rating from customers, and it is close to another eatery called Rainbow Vegetarian Café."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Davidge for the following movie plot: In the late 21st century, an interstellar war between the humans (associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA) and the Dracs (a sentient, bipedal reptilian humanoid race) is fought.

Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 06:22 EST, 13 January 2012. Nearly half of Mormons say church members face significant discrimination in the United States, and a third believe voters are not ready to elect Mitt Romney, or any other member of their church, president. A survey of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life comes as the former Massachusetts governor fights to keep his GOP front-runner status. The campaign moves next to the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where evangelical voters are key. Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who is Mormon, is also seeking the Republican nomination. Front-runner: Mitt Romney's campaign has been emphasising values that Mormons and conservative Christians share. LDS church leaders have long. complained that critics take obscure or outdated Mormon teachings and. describe them as core doctrine. The church cast aside the teaching of. polygamy in 1890, and in 1978, abolished the barrier that kept those of. African descent from full participation in the church. In the latest Pew. survey, only two per cent of Mormons said polygamy is morally. acceptable. The Pew study found that almost half of Mormons in the U.S. consider themselves more discriminated against than African Americans. Despite the prejudice Mormons feel, a. majority expressed optimism about their future. The question of religion: Republican presidential candidate Governor Jon Huntsman is another Mormon seeking the nomination. More than 60 per cent. believe Americans are moving toward acceptance of Mormonism but 32 per. cent don't believe the U.S. is ready to accept a Latter-day Saint as. president. An overwhelming majority of Mormon voters hold favourable. views of Romney, the poll found. In the 2012 race, Romney has not. directly addressed theological differences between his faith and. historic Christianity, as he did in his first bid for the nomination,. with a 2007 faith-and-values speech in Texas, Instead, his campaign has. been emphasizing values that Mormons and conservative Christians share. About 77 per cent of Mormons in the. survey identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and most hold. much stronger conservative views than the general public. Three-quarters. support a smaller government that provides fewer services. The same. percentage say having an abortion is morally wrong. Two-thirds believe. homosexuality should be discouraged. Rank-and-file Mormons reflect the. strong emphasis throughout the LDS church on family. Asked their life. priorities, a large majority of respondents listed being a good parent. and having a successful marriage. Worship: Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah, a popular tourist destination owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Latter-day Saints also have a high. level of religious observance that surpasses even the most devout. American Christians. Three-quarters of Mormons said they attended. religious services weekly or more, compared to 64 per cent of white. evangelicals and 42 per cent of white Catholics. Two-thirds of Mormons. say they pray several times a day, compared to half of evangelicals and. about one-third of Catholics. The poll of 1,019 Mormons was. conducted October 25 through November 16 of last year and has a margin. of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points:.

Since 1994, a group of evangelical. and Mormon scholars who have been meeting to discuss theology, focusing. on their shared beliefs. All but two percent of Mormons in the Pew. survey said they believe that Jesus was resurrected. Nearly all believe. the Bible is the word of God and describe themselves Christian or. 'Christ-centred'. However, Mormons just as strongly hold beliefs that traditional Christians consider heretical. The study showed that Mormons and. white evangelicals share an intense commitment to family life, prayer,. the Bible and conservative politics, including support for the. Republican Party and smaller government, but the two groups strongly. hold divergent religious beliefs. Conservative Christians, including. Protestants and Roman Catholics, generally do not consider Mormons to be. Christian, but it is unclear what role those objections will play in. South Carolina vote and beyond. Surveys have found that Republicans with. the strongest objections to Mormonism also are among the fiercest. opponents to President Barack Obama, and would back a Mormon in the. general election. All but six per cent of Mormons. believe that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate, physical. beings, a rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity, in which God, the. Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit coexist and share one substance. Joseph Smith became Mormonism's. founding prophet after he said he experienced visions during the late. 1820s. He said he was told not to join any church because they all held. wrong beliefs. An angel, he said, then directed him to gold plates that. had been buried in the ground in upstate New York, which Smith then. translated as the Book of Mormon. Nearly all Mormons in the survey said. they believe the Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets and that. the president of the LDS church is a prophet of God. The Pew Forum estimates that Mormons. comprise less than two per cent of the U.S. population, are overwhelming. white and in the West. Nearly six in ten Mormons said that most or all. of their close friends are also Mormon. The LDS church has been running a. multimillion-dollar advertising campaign featuring the personal stories. of Mormons hoping to educate the public.

Does it make sense to study Mathematics at undergraduate level, then MIS in graduate school, and then a second Master’s or PhD in economics? How many solar panels do I need to produce 1300 kWh?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning as they are related to entirely different subjects. Let's break down each question separately: 1. \\"Does it make sense to study Mathematics at undergraduate level, then MIS in graduate school, and then a second Master’s or PhD in economics?\\" This question is about the feasibility and practicality of pursuing a specific sequence of academic degrees in different fields. The person asking the question wants to know if it is reasonable and beneficial to first study Mathematics at an undergraduate level, then pursue a Master in Information Systems (MIS), and finally obtain a second master's degree or a PhD in Economics. It is essential to examine the objectives of each field of study and the career goals of the individual making this inquiry. Studying Mathematics at the undergraduate level can provide a strong foundation in analytical reasoning, problem-solving, and mathematical theories. A Master in Information Systems focuses on the practical application of technology for data processing, communication, and management. Lastly, a master's degree or PhD in Economics deals with understanding and analyzing the forces that shape economic decisions and policies. Combining such diverse fields of study can be advantageous for individuals who are aiming for careers involving multiple disciplines or specializing in an interdisciplinary area. It may also offer a broader understanding of various concepts and translate into a strong analytical skill set. However, it would be beneficial to carefully consider the overlap between these fields and how each degree would contribute to the individual's long-term career goals. 2. \\"How many solar panels do I need to produce 1300 kWh?\\" This question is about calculating the number of solar panels necessary for generating a specific amount of energy – 1300 kilowatt-hours (kWh). To answer this question, several factors need to be considered, such as the efficiency of solar panels, the amount of sunlight available in the location where they will be installed, and the energy consumption patterns of the user. First, determine the average output (in watts) of a solar panel. Solar panels come in various sizes and efficiencies, but for the purpose of this example, let's assume that a standard solar panel produces 250 watts. Understanding that 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert the desired energy production to kW: 1300 kWh = 1.3 MWh (megawatt-hours). Next, consider the number of sun hours per day in the location where the solar panels will be installed. These are the average daily effective hours of sunlight exposure. For our example, let's assume that the location receives an average of 4 sun hours per day. We can now calculate the total wattage needed: 1.3 MWh / 30 days / 4 sun hours = 10.83 kW per day. Divide the desired wattage by the wattage of a single solar panel to find the total number of solar panels necessary: 10.83 kW / 0.250 kW = 43.32 solar panels. Since you can't have a fraction of a solar panel, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, 44 solar panels would be necessary to produce approximately 1300 kWh per month in this example. Keep in mind that the exact number of solar panels depends on factors such as panel efficiency, sun hours, and specific energy needs."},{"instruction":"Here is a question about this article: The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact. What is the answer to this question: What was a way to reach the economic goals of the Ottoman economic system?","output":"The Ottoman economic system aimed to maintain and consolidate the ruler's power, enhance state revenues, and ensure the prosperity of subjects while preventing social disorder and maintaining social and traditional organization. One way to achieve these economic goals was through taxation policies that were designed to stimulate economic growth, promote trade, and create a conducive environment for the productive classes to flourish. Taxation policies in the Ottoman Empire were structured around a tax-farming system, known as the Iltizam system, where individuals or groups of individuals would secure the rights to collect taxes on behalf of the state for a specific period in exchange for an upfront payment to the state treasury. The tax farmers in the Ottoman Empire, known as \\"mültezim,\\" were responsible for obtaining the highest possible revenue while ensuring that the taxpayers were not overburdened. The tax system in the Ottoman Empire was very efficient and flexible, as it allowed tax rates to be adjusted according to the economic conditions and the ability of the subjects to pay. The Ottomans were particularly concerned with preventing the emergence of social disorder by ensuring that the productive classes remained prosperous. As a result, tax exemptions or reductions were granted to subjects during years of bad harvest, natural disasters, or war, which helped maintain the prosperity of the productive classes and the society as a whole. Trade was another vital component of the Ottoman economic system. The empire sought to promote and regulate trade through various measures, such as the establishment of equitable and predictable customs duties, the maintenance and expansion of efficient transportation networks, and the fostering of an environment conducive to regional and international trade. Ottoman rulers actively encouraged merchants, artisans, and skilled craftsmen to settle in the empire, and they provided them with various incentives in the form of tax exemptions, property rights, and other privileges. Agriculture, craft production, and mining were essential economic activities in the Ottoman Empire, and the state implemented policies to support the development of these sectors. Sustainable agricultural practices were promoted through the so-called \\"timar\\" system, in which land was granted to military officers who, in exchange for their military service, were required to cultivate the lands, collect taxes from peasants, and maintain order. This system provided incentives for landholders to invest in and develop agricultural land, thus contributing to the overall prosperity of the empire. Furthermore, a guild system was in place, which controlled various aspects of craft production and trade in the Ottoman cities. The guilds maintained quality standards, controlled prices, and regulated competition among the artisans. The state sponsored and protected certain strategic industries, such as silk production and weapon manufacturing, by granting them monopolies and other privileges. To summarize, the Ottoman economic system aimed to achieve its economic goals by implementing and maintaining a range of policies that focused on taxation, trade, agriculture, and craft production. These policies were designed to promote the prosperity of the productive classes, increase state revenues, and prevent social disorder, all while maintaining the traditional organization of society. By providing incentives and support to key economic sectors, the Ottoman Empire sought to strike a balance between state control and economic freedom, ultimately fostering growth and stability within the empire."},{"instruction":"Background: Julian Paul Assange (; ne Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Context: Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \\"lesser-degree rape\\" (mindre grov valdtakt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain. In 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \\"lesser degree rape\\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020. On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\\", she said. Question: What were the results of the allegations?. Whats the answer?","output":"The results of the allegations against Julian Assange were a complex series of events that spanned several years, ultimately leading to the investigation being dropped in 2017. Here is a summary of the outcomes and the current status: 1. Initial Investigation and Reopening the Case: In August 2010, Assange became the subject of sexual assault allegations in Sweden. The case was initially closed, but later re-opened in November 2010 by a special prosecutor. 2. Asylum at Ecuadorian Embassy: Assange sought and was granted asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in June 2012. He remained within the embassy's premises until April 2019 to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden. 3. Change in Swedish Law: In 2015, due to public criticism, Swedish law was changed to allow interrogation of individuals through video link or within an embassy. This allowed Swedish officials to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in November 2016. 4. Expiration of Statute of Limitations: By the time Assange was interrogated, the statute of limitations had expired for three of the four allegations. The only remaining charge was \\"lesser-degree rape,\\" with a statute of limitations that would expire in 2020. 5. Dropping the Investigation: On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped the investigation against Assange, citing difficulties in communicating reliably with him through the Ecuadorian Embassy. The arrest warrant was revoked with the possibility of the investigation being resumed if Assange were to visit Sweden before August 2020. 6. No Pronouncement of Guilt: The Swedish prosecutor, Marianne Ny, emphasized that dropping the case does not indicate a pronouncement about Assange's guilt or innocence. Despite the resolution of the Swedish allegations, Assange's legal troubles continued as he faced other charges related to WikiLeaks. In April 2019, he was arrested by UK police after being expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy, and he is currently facing extradition proceedings to the United States on several charges, including conspiracy to commit computer intrusion."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence and two mentions from the text (arguments), indicate a phrase (a verb or noun phrase) that describes the relationship between the provided arguments.

In The Conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday. Gail Collins: David, this election season has worn me down. And as far as I can tell, the polls now show that every race is a tie. This happens a lot toward the end, but I can’t help wondering if this year the voters have decided they don’t want to reward anybody. David Brooks: Gail, what do you mean? This campaign is just getting going. I only recently learned that there is no religion clause in the First Amendment (O’Donnell); that Americans are so fearful, they might do something completely insane, like not re-elect Blanche Lincoln (Obama); and that the economy is so bad some Americans are even being forced to give up their health club memberships (Obama). And did you know there are 47 people running for governor in New York, and at most one or two of them is sane? Gail Collins: I would say that “one or two” is a huge overstatement. But let me ask you some end-of-the-cycle questions. If there were one pretty-sure-loser candidate that you could magically make a winner in two weeks, who would it be? I’ll take Scott McAdams, the Democratic Senate candidate in Alaska. He was picked as a sacrificial lamb to run against the incumbent, Lisa Murkowski. When Murkowski got beaten by a Tea Party candidate in the primary, I think he wandered around stunned for a little bit, but he’s turned into a pretty fair candidate, and he just seems like a sweet guy who might actually be a good senator. The Republican nominee, Joe Miller, strikes me as a mean-spirited egoist. And Murkowski, who’s running as a write-in candidate, really is the establishment heroine in the worst sense of the term. David Brooks: I’d have to go with John Spratt. He may not be a sure loser, but he is endangered. He is a South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee. He has always struck me as extremely knowledgeable and fair-minded. Come to think of it, most of the Democrats who are going to lose in the House are moderate types who don’t deserve to suffer for Nancy Pelosi’s sins. Gail Collins: Let’s leave poor Nancy Pelosi out of this. If the Republicans take the House, the country will realize not only that every speaker is doomed to become a caricature of themselves, but also that the caricature can be way, way worse than Pelosi. Anyhow, second question: What’s been the biggest disappointment for you this election season? Mine is that the campaign has killed the energy and global warming bill, probably forever. Republicans who used to be in favor of it have switched sides. And of course you’ve got one of the Democratic Senate candidates running ads showing him putting a bullet through its heart. Goodbye Arctic ice cap. David Brooks: I guess I’m still smarting over Bob Bennett’s nomination defeat in Utah. Not only was he co-sponsor of the Wyden-Bennett-God health care bill (cue harp music), but his defeat was a sure sign that nobody should ever sponsor serious bipartisan legislation ever. Gail Collins: Worst single election contest? I’m already on record that I think it’s the Nevada Senate race. When the Democratic incumbent’s best hopes lie with all the people who hate him voting “none of the above” that’s not a happy situation. And when the only alternative is a woman who thinks Dearborn, Mich., is governed by Muslim Shariah law, well, all I can say is poor Nevada. They’ve already got the highest unemployment rate in the country. They deserve better. David Brooks: I guess I agree. The Kentucky Senate race has gotten pretty nasty. But I’ve sort of been impressed by Rand Paul. Nevada’s got no bright spots. Before this election, everybody was saying that Harry Reid may not be graceful, but he is a relentless campaigner. I haven’t seen it. Gail Collins: No, you can’t relentlessly campaign from a basement, or wherever he’s been hiding. Let’s end on a cheerful note. Anything that made you happy, out on the campaign trail? I can’t say I spotted any cheery new trends. But whenever I go out to rallies or town meetings and see all those people who didn’t get paid to show up, like yours truly, and who didn’t come in a bus rented by some special interest group, but just got in their cars and drove over to hear what the candidate has to say, I fall in love with this process all over again. David Brooks: I rarely complain about the media, but I think we have made at least one huge blunder this year. We have given lavish attention to the oddballs, like Christine O’Donnell and Carl Paladino, but there are many good people running this year who have received very little national press. It’s your home state, but how many people could name the Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio? What about Indiana? Their names are Rob Portman and Dan Coats. They both have served in Congress before and they both were excellent. The colorful wackos deserve the attention, but we probably should have devoted a little more to the confidence-inducing ones too.

Finally, we'll divide the remaining amount by the number of pens to get the average price of a pen. Step 1: Find the total cost of the pencils. The average price of a pencil is given as 2.00, and there were 75 pencils purchased. To find the total cost of the pencils, we multiply the average price by the number of pencils: Total cost of pencils = average price of a pencil × number of pencils Total cost of pencils = 2.00 × 75 Total cost of pencils = 150 Step 2: Subtract the total cost of pencils from the total cost of all items to find the total cost of the pens. Total cost of all items = 450 Total cost of pens = total cost of all items - total cost of pencils Total cost of pens = 450 - 150 Total cost of pens = 300 Step 3: Divide the total cost of pens by the number of pens to find the average price of a pen. Number of pens = 30 Average price of a pen = total cost of pens / number of pens Average price of a pen = 300 / 30 Average price of a pen = 10 Based on our calculations, the average price of a pen is 10.

(If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Unabsorbed matter and waste products are excreted from the body through a well-organized process involving multiple organ systems. This process can be broken down into a series of steps, each of which contributes to the overall elimination of waste materials from the body. 1. Digestive system: The digestive system plays a critical role in processing consumed food and separating nutrients from waste. During digestion, the body breaks down the ingested food into essential nutrients. Unabsorbed matter, such as indigestible fibers, along with some metabolic waste products, become part of the fecal matter. 2. Large intestine: The large intestine, or colon, is primarily responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested food residue. The colon also compacts the undigested material to form solid feces. These fecal materials contain unabsorbed matter, waste products, and microorganisms from the gut. 3. Rectum: The rectum temporarily stores feces until the body is ready for defecation. The act of defecation is regulated by the nervous system, which controls the relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters. 4. Defecation: During defecation, waste products in the form of feces are expelled through the anus, which is the final step of the digestive system in removing unabsorbed materials and waste products from the body. Apart from the digestive system, the body also eliminates waste materials through other methods: 1. Urinary system: The kidneys filter blood, removing excess water, electrolytes, and waste products such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine. These substances form urine, which is stored in the bladder and eventually expelled from the body through the urethra during urination. 2. Respiratory system: Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is transported in the blood to the lungs, where it diffuses into the air spaces (alveoli) and is eliminated from the body during exhalation. 3. Integumentary system: The skin also plays a role in waste removal through sweat glands, which excrete excess water, electrolytes, and small amounts of urea in sweat. 4. Liver: This vital organ helps convert toxic substances into less harmful compounds, which can then be eliminated via the kidney (in urine) or the intestine (in feces). Thus, unabsorbed matter and waste products are excreted from the body through a combination of processes involving the digestive, urinary, respiratory, and integumentary systems, with the liver playing a key role in detoxification."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: \\"Hon? You still awake?\\" Quiet. Jan pulled herself out of the bed and stood up, looking around the dark room for anything. She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \\"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real. She could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \\"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons.

PUBLISHED:. 16:38 EST, 19 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:42 EST, 20 June 2013. Pensioners are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places. Thousands of older people are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places. An international report found 'bed blocking' patients are stuck on wards unnecessarily for an average of 30 days – the highest level since the last election – putting their recovery at risk. Campaigners said the 'bleak' study raises a fresh NHS scandal, on the heels of a meltdown in accident and emergency and out of hours care. The problem in England's elderly care. is highlighted in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation. and Development, which represents industrialised countries. It. found that in January – the latest month for which figures were. available – some 4,200 patients were kept unnecessarily in hospitals for. a total of 126,000 days. That. works out at an average of 30 days per patient spent waiting to leave. even though there was no clinical reason for them to be there. Just. after the Coalition came to power, in August 2010, the average was 22. days, according to the OECD. Hospitals are forced to keep such patients. because they are too frail to be sent home on their own. Campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital, and also risk superbug infections. They. say councils should provide home helps or free adaptations such as. handrails to enable elderly people to leave hospital. Alternatively,. they should be put in a care home for a limited period until they are. ready to go to their own house. Many town halls say they cannot afford. to provide these services after recent cuts – forcing the NHS to step. in. The Daily Mail's Dignity For The. Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted the plight of older people. as local authorities increasingly restrict social care to those with. 'critical' or 'substantial' needs, and home care has been slashed – with. 20,000 fewer people receiving support. Delayed discharges have cost the cash-strapped health service around £260million since the election. Michelle. Mitchell, from charity Age UK, said: 'This is not just a real waste of. resources. Unnecessary and lengthy hospital stays can seriously. undermine an older person's recovery. Campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital, and also risk superbug infections. 'These figures are an insight into the increasingly bleak reality of the social care crisis where funding has failed to keep pace with demand. 'The steep rise in the length of time people are waiting ... suggests something has gone seriously wrong in the transition to home or residential care at a time when we know social care spending has fallen so dramatically. 'The care system urgently needs an injection of funds and a long-term commitment to sufficient resources.' The OECD report, entitled A Good Life In Old Age, said delayed discharges result from 'inadequate capacity in nursing homes or home-care services and support'. It said: 'Waiting times are regarded as an indicator of poor access and a major challenge for delivering high-quality care services. 'Waiting may occur when older people needing long-term care are discharged from acute care to a more appropriate care setting such as community care and residential care for which there is a waiting list. 'This may lead to patients occupying acute care beds when no longer in need of acute care services.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about elderly people who are staying in hospitals longer than they need to because there aren't enough helpers at home or spaces in nursing homes for them. This is a problem in England and it's getting worse. It's not good for older people to stay in hospitals longer than they need to because they can get more sick there.

After answering a long questionnaire, Stan is informed that he is extremely depressed and therefore a perfect candidate for Scientology. They offer to help him out for 240. Back home, Stan asks his parents for the money. His father suggests that he use the money he had been saving. Stan pays and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his \\"thetan levels\\" using an \\"E-meter\\". Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified. There, the president of Scientology determines that, because his reading is so high, Stan must be a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology's founder and prophet. Later that night, a large group of Scientologists, including John Travolta, gather outside the Marsh house to celebrate Hubbard's \\"second coming\\". The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. They are opposed to Stan's participation, but the president informs them that \\"we're not asking him to join us; we're asking him to lead us\\". Randy sends Stan to his room, where he finds Tom Cruise waiting. Cruise, believing that Stan is genuinely Hubbard's reincarnation, asks him whether he has enjoyed his acting. When \\"Hubbard\\" replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy, Tom hears that he is \\"a failure in the eyes of the prophet\\" and locks himself in Stan's closet. He refuses to come out, despite the entreaties of Randy, Nicole Kidman, the police, Travolta and R. Kelly to \\"come out of the closet\\". Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet. Downstairs, the church president tries to convince Stan's parents to allow their son to participate. He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church -- a condensed version of the story of Xenu, based directly on the Scientology Operating Thetan III document, and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading \\"This is what Scientologists actually believe\\". He then begs Stan to continue writing where \\"L. Ron\\" left off. Stan, impressed by the story, does so. He shows his writings to the Scientology president, who initially approves of the work, but when Stan says \\"to really be a church, you can't charge money to help\\", the president reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a global money-making scam. He asks that Stan continue with that in mind. Stan appears to agree and keeps writing. Outside the house, the president introduces Stan to his followers, to whom he will read parts of his new doctrine. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan states that he is not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that \\"Scientology is just a big fat global scam\\". The Scientologists grow angry and threaten to sue him. The celebrities in the closet appear, threatening to sue Stan as well. The last shot is Stan daring them to do so.

American Grill Oh yes there was a time it was 'hip' and 'cool' to eat at TGI Friday. That was about the time that those words were frequently used to mean exactly that.

The reviewer expresses disappointment, frustration, and dissatisfaction with various aspects of the product. Firstly, the title of the review, \\"so disappointed,\\" clearly indicates that the expectations of the reviewer were not met. The review starts with a strong negative statement, \\"I hate the bed skirt,\\" which clearly demonstrates a negative sentiment towards the product. The reviewer also criticizes the fact that the bed skirt received is not what was shown in the original picture. This further contributes to the negative tone, as the reviewer feels misled by the discrepancy between the product image and the received item. Moreover, the reviewer's mention of the possibility of returning the whole product due to dissatisfaction adds to the negative tone of the review. The reference to the return process being \\"a hassle\\" highlights the reviewer's frustration with the entire experience. However, it's worth noting that there is a slight positive aspect mentioned in the review, too, when the reviewer states, \\"The comforter is not horrible.\\" This suggests that while the bed skirt is disappointing, there is at least some satisfaction with another part of the product. Additionally, the reviewer's desire to find matching sheets to make the product look better implies that they are willing to still consider making the best out of the situation, despite their general dissatisfaction. In conclusion, this product review has a predominantly negative tone, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the product's discrepancies and contemplating returning the entire item.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What do plasmids do in resistance?","output":"In bacterial resistance, plasmids play a significant role in the dissemination and acquisition of resistance genes. Plasmids are small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that are separate from a bacterium's chromosomal DNA. They can replicate independently and are capable of transferring genetic information between bacteria through a process called horizontal gene transfer. In the context of antibiotic resistance, plasmids often carry one or more resistance genes that provide the host bacterium with the ability to counteract the effects of specific antibiotics. When a plasmid containing resistance genes is transferred from one bacterium to another, it can also transfer the conferred resistance, thereby propagating the resistant trait within bacterial populations. Plasmids can spread resistance genes across different bacterial strains or species, which allows for rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance within and between microbial communities. Some plasmids carry multiple resistance genes, which can confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. This creates a substantial challenge in treating infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria as standard antibiotic treatments may lose their effectiveness. Furthermore, some resistance mechanisms encoded by a single gene can provide cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics, making the acquisition of such resistance genes even more advantageous for the survival of bacteria exposed to different antibacterial compounds. Overall, plasmids serve as key vehicles in the transfer, dissemination, and evolution of antibiotic resistance among bacteria."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Fewer expenses per burglaries, reduced vandalism, increased security and a substantial reduction in insurance premiums due to fewer claims – these are the effects of the security system created by Securitas Denmark A/S for the Municipality of Faaborg-Midtfyn in Denmark.","output":"Step 1: Identify the spaces within the sentence.

His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. - A university museum is a repository of collections run by a university, typically founded to aid teaching and research within the institution of higher learning. The Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford in England is an early example, originally housed in the building that is now the Museum of the History of Science. A more recent example is the Holburne Museum of Art in Bath, originally constructed as a hotel in 1796 it is now the official museum of the University of Bath. - Nubia is a region along the Nile river located in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. It was one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, with a history that can be traced from at least 2000 B.C. onward (through Nubian monuments and artifacts, as well as written records from Egypt and Rome), and was home to one of the African empires. There were a number of large Nubian kingdoms throughout the Postclassical Era, the last of which collapsed in 1504, when Nubia became divided between Egypt and the Sennar sultanate, resulting in the Arabization of much of the Nubian population. Nubia was again united within Ottoman Egypt in the 19th century, and within the Kingdom of Egypt from 1899 to 1956. - The Ashmolean Museum (in full the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology) on Beaumont Street, Oxford, England, is the world's first university museum. Its first building was erected in 16781683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment. In November 2011, new galleries focusing on Egypt and Nubia were also unveiled. - Elias Ashmole (23 May 1617 18 May 1692) was a celebrated English antiquary, politician, officer of arms, astrologer and student of alchemy. Ashmole supported the royalist side during the English Civil War, and at the restoration of Charles II he was rewarded with several lucrative offices. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016.

The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by Charles Dickens. It catapulted the previously obscure Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about Realism in the arts. - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - Thomas Carlyle (4 December 1795 5 February 1881) was a Scottish philosopher, satirical writer, essayist, historian and teacher. Considered one of the most important social commentators of his time, he presented many lectures during his lifetime with certain acclaim in the Victorian era. One of those conferences resulted in his famous work \\"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History\\" where he explains that the key role in history lies in the actions of the \\"Great Man\\", claiming that \\"History is nothing but the biography of the Great Man\\". - John Ruskin (8 February 1819 20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, as well as an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin also penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

Question: What is the main point of the passage? Context: The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.

Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". Options: A. 0. B. 1. C. 2. D. 3. E. 4. F. 5.","output":"Based on the analysis of the two sentences, I would rate their similarity as a D. 3 out of 5. Here is the reasoning behind choosing this rating: Both sentences discuss the drop in the share price of Aspen Technology. However, there are differences in the specific data presented in each sentence, which doesn't make them identical but highlights their overall similar theme. 1. The first sentence states that Aspen Technology's shares dropped 74 cents, or 23 percent, to close at 2.48 on the Nasdaq. 2. The second sentence reports that in afternoon trading, Aspen's shares were off 89 cents or more than 27 percent at 2.33 per share. While both sentences convey the downward trend in the stock price of Aspen Technology, the actual data points differ in the extent of the drop and the timing when this change occurred. The first sentence refers to the closing price on the Nasdaq, and the second sentence refers to the price during afternoon trading. Additionally, the percentages and the exact amounts for the decrease in stock price are not the same in both sentences. In conclusion, the two sentences are similar in their general theme of the drop in Aspen Technology's share price but differ in the specifics of the percentages and amounts involved. Therefore, a rating of 3 out of 5 (option D) signifies that they are moderately similar, but not very similar or identical."},{"instruction":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where are antibiotics banned for animals?\\" is in \\"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Antibiotics have been banned for animals in various forms and at different times in different regions. In the UK, restrictions on antibiotic use for animals were implemented in 1970 following the Swann report of 1969. The European Union (EU) banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents in animals since 2003. Several major organizations, including the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), the American Public Health Association (APHA), and the American Medical Association (AMA), have called for restricting antibiotic use in food animal production and ending all nontherapeutic uses. These calls are aimed at curbing the rise of antibiotic resistance. However, there have been certain delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics. Factors contributing to these delays include resistance to regulations by industries involved in the usage or selling of antibiotics and the time needed for adequate research to establish causal links between antibiotic use and resistance.

Essentially an ancient Greek people, they gradually expanded from their homeland along the Haliacmon valley on the northern edge of the Greek world, absorbing or driving out neighbouring non-Greek tribes, primarily Thracian and Illyrian. They spoke Ancient Macedonian, a language closely related to Ancient Greek, perhaps a dialect, although the prestige language of the region was at first Attic and then Koine Greek. Their religious beliefs mirrored those of other Greeks, following the main deities of the Greek pantheon, although the Macedonians continued Archaic burial practices that had ceased in other parts of Greece after the 6th century BC. Context: By the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon, the Macedonian elite started importing significantly greater customs, artwork, and art traditions from other regions of Greece. However, they still retained more archaic, perhaps Homeric funerary rites connected with the symposium and drinking rites that were typified with items such as decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-century BC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6th century BC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs. Surviving Macedonian painted artwork includes frescoes and murals on walls, but also decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still exist on the bas-reliefs of the Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by ancient Macedonians, such as the brightly-colored tomb paintings of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki showing figures wearing headgear ranging from feathered helmets to kausia and petasos caps. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics serve as another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork, especially those discovered at Pella dating to the 4th century BC. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored for Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the generic royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage). In some instances these themes are combined within the same work, indicating a metaphorical connection that seems to be affirmed by later Byzantine Greek literature. Question: Were the art well preserved? Answer:","output":"Some of the Macedonian art has been well preserved, allowing historians and researchers to study and gain insight into the culture, fashion, and customs of ancient Macedonia. Surviving Macedonian art includes metalwork, painted artwork such as frescoes and murals, and mosaics that have been discovered in tombs and archaeological sites. Examples of well-preserved Macedonian art include the Derveni Krater, the Alexander Sarcophagus (with trace colors still visible on its bas-reliefs), and the tomb paintings of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki. Additionally, the mosaics found at Pella, such as the Stag Hunt Mosaic and the Lion Hunt Mosaic, showcase the artistic styles and themes popular in Macedonia during that time. While a significant portion of Macedonian art has been preserved, it is important to note that not all art from that period remains intact, and some may have been lost or damaged over time. However, the preserved pieces provide valuable information about ancient Macedonian art and culture."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. - Primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia is a special form of polydipsia . It is usually associated with a patient 's increasing fluid intake due to the sensation of having a dry mouth . When the term \`\` psychogenic polydipsia '' is used , it implies that the condition is caused by mental disorders . However , the dry mouth is often due to phenothiazine medications used in some mental disorders , rather than the underlying condition . Some forms of primary polydipsia are explicitly characterized as nonpsychogenic . - Thirst is the craving for fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink. It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance. It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as salt. If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, the brain signals thirst. - Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek \\"very thirsty\\", which is derived from (\\"much, many\\") + (\\"thirst\\"). Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds. What entity does 'primary polydipsia' has the relation 'instance of' with?

The premise states that a \\"roller girl skirts the edge of the track.\\" In other words, a girl is skating near the outer boundary of a roller-skating track. 2. The premise also mentions that \\"her teammates look on.\\" This suggests that there are other people who are part of her skating team or group, and they are watching her as she skates.

McClane and Carver escape and return to headquarters, where Simon calls again and threatens to detonate more bombs if McClane and Carver do not follow his instructions. Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles. He tells them to reach Wall Street station 90 blocks south, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound 3 train. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives. McClane locates the bomb and throws it off the train, it still detonates, derailing the train and sending it through the station with minimal injuries due to Carver's warnings. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by FBI agents, who reveal Simon is Peter Krieg, a former Colonel in the East German People's Army and a mercenary-for-hire.

Have the confidence to know that you're an amazing person who has a lot to offer, and you'll be more likely to attract a diverse group of interesting people. Don't tell people what you think they want to hear just to make them like you and avoid bragging just to make yourself sound cool. People will be able to tell if you're just trying to impress them or suck up to them, and you'll be less likely to make friends with them. Instead, slowly open up and let people know about who you are and the things that really matter to you. Also if you are fake chances are that people will notice and they will talk making this even harder for you. If you only become popular by trying to be someone you're not, then where's the fun in it? You don't want to keep up a charade forever, do you? Remember that if you have to completely change who you are to get people to like you, then it probably isn't worth it. Nobody likes a stuck up person. Smile to the people you know in the hallways. Don't act like you're better than them; arrogance is a huge turn off. If someone mentions you, you want them to talk about your good side, not your bad side. However, don't overdo it or they'll just start using you. You may think that you have to act like one of the Mean Girls to be popular, but in reality, this won't get you very far. To be truly nice, you should be polite and have good manners. This means holding doors for people, saying hello to people you know, making room for people walking in the halls, and being friendly even if you're in a bad mood. This doesn't mean you have to put on that false cheery persona you can sometimes see from adults; it just means that you should be kind to people, regardless of how popular you think they are. There's nothing worse than a person who is only nice to popular people or people who he thinks can get him somewhere. If you're mean to the people \\"below\\" you and nice to the people \\"above\\" you, then people will be on to you pretty soon. If you want to make genuine friends, then you can't let people walk all over you. If you stick to your guns and know when to defend yourself, you'll actually gain respect and will be more likely to make more friends and to gain popularity. If you're nice to people just because you want them to like you, you won't get very far and you won't be respected. If someone is being mean to you, making you feel bad about yourself, and just generally putting you down for no reason, you shouldn't have to take it. Let the person know that his or her actions are unacceptable. You don't have to stoop down to a person's level just because the person is being mean to you. You can tell someone to stop what he or she is doing without calling names or being mean in return. Remember that you're better than that. If you're friendly and are always going up to new people and making small talk with them, you'll be on your way to easily making friends. You should be excited to get to know new people, no matter what crowd they're in or what grade they're in. Of course, you should take it slow and not bombard new people, or people who look busy, but if you find an opportunity to talk to someone new, like if you're at your locker by yourself with another person at his locker standing next to you, then you should take it. When you're talking to new people, you should take things easy, talking about your classes, your hobbies, or what music you like. Ask the person a few easy questions to show that you care. You can talk about the serious stuff later, when you get to know each other better. The key to being truly social and popular is not to talk about yourself all the time or to brag, but to show a real interest in other people. As the saying goes, you should be interested, not interesting. People will like you a lot more if you ask them questions and show that you care about them than if you try to show off. The next time you talk to someone, smile, ask questions about the person's day, make eye contact, and show that you really do care. This doesn't mean you should fake it, but that you should make an effort to make people feel like they are cared for. Here are some things you can do: Ask the person about how his weekend went. Ask people about something new to be shared. Ask about their likes and dislikes. Ask about the person's extra-curricular activities Compliment something the person is wearing Ask about something the person mentioned last time Find a balance between talking about yourself and the other person Sure, high school is a time when many people act like they are literally too cool for school. They may wear too much eyeliner, hunch over in class, show up late, or shrug when their teachers reprimand them. However, this should not be the way you approach high school. Embrace the fact that it's okay to care, and that you should try to go after the things that matter to you instead of worrying that you'll come off like a dork. If you really like English class, get excited about talking about your favorite book; if you love being on the tennis team, tell your friends about your upcoming match. Talking about the things that make you happy will make you a more exciting, engaging person. Give your opinions too. Agreeing with the opposite person and simply nodding to whatever they say will make you look very boring. Try to be a conversation starter and know when to listen and when to answer back to people. Small talk is a skill that many high school students lack, and if you know how to make small talk, you'll up your social game and will be on your way to being more popular. To make small talk, you just have to be able to chat with people about anything at all when you see them in the halls, without getting nervous or running out of things to say. Just relax, stop worrying about saying the wrong thing, and make the other person comfortable as you engage in a quick conversation in the halls or before class starts. Here are some things you can do when you make small talk: Talk about the class you just came from or were going to. Ask the person about his or her weekend. Talk about anything coming up in school, such as the fall dance or football game, and ask if the person is going. Chat about something in your environment, such as a flyer for the pep rally, or a shirt the person is wearing with the name of your favorite college on it. You may think that the last thing you want to do in high school is to every smile at anyone, because smiling is just so uncool, but you should change your attitude if you want to be more social and get on your way to being more popular. Smiling will make you more approachable, will make more people notice you, and will make more people likely to feel welcome in your presence. It's a big part of being friendly. You don't have to smile at absolutely everyone in your school, but if you walk by someone in the halls, take a chance and give that person a little smile, even if you don't know him or her. Let's face it. People in high school tend to be judgmental, and are likely to think that someone is mean or rude for no reason. If you smile more, people will be much more likely to think you're a welcoming, open person. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, being genuine and avoiding fake behavior is crucial for establishing strong, meaningful relationships and friendships. Gaining popularity should not involve changing who you are or trying to impress others. Instead, be confident in yourself, be nice to everyone regardless of their social status, and stand up for yourself when necessary. Show genuine interest in others by asking questions, talking about common interests, and listening attentively. Be enthusiastic about your passions and never be afraid to express your opinions. Work on improving your small talk skills, which can significantly enhance your social life. Smiling more can make you more approachable and create a positive impression. Embrace the fact that it's okay to care about your interests and pursue them. By presenting yourself as a friendly, authentic, and engaging person, you can attract a diverse group of people and cultivate meaningful connections. High school is a time of growth and exploration, and embracing your true self will ultimately lead to greater satisfaction and stronger friendships."},{"instruction":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

The kingdom is ruled by King Aelius, a wise and fair ruler who deeply values these bonds between humans and sea creatures. Every year, they celebrate the Festival of Whales, a celebration that commemorates a historic tale of humans and whales uniting to save the kingdom. The film opens in the vibrant and bustling coastal town of Porta Marina as people prepare for the upcoming Festival of Whales. Our protagonist, Prince Alexander, the young and charismatic heir to the Marinian throne, is fascinated by the festival and the tales he has heard from his father about the boundless and unexplored oceans. However, he is conflicted by his duty to eventually take over his father's responsibilities. During the opening of the festival, a massive and ancient whale named Leviathan resurfaces, returning to the kingdom after many years of absence. Leviathan is welcomed with awe and adulation by the people as its presence indicates an abundant, successful year for the kingdom. Leviathan communicates a sense of urgency with King Aelius through a mystical medallion that has been passed down through generations, only to be activated when grave danger looms over the kingdom. The medallion reveals that a mysterious darkness is spreading across the deep ocean, threatening to consume the entire marine ecosystem and eventually reach the shores of Marinia. Unable to embark on this adventure due to his age and on-going responsibilities as a ruler, King Aelius summons Prince Alexander to venture into the vast blue ocean with Leviathan to investigate the cause of this darkness. The hesitant Prince Alexander accepts his mission and sets sail with a ragtag crew of skilled sailors and local fishermen, as well as a young marine biologist, Elara, who plays an essential role in deciphering the truth behind the mysterious darkness. As they traverse the seemingly endless ocean, Prince Alexander and his crew form a genuine bond and camaraderie. They encounter various unique marine creatures, including powerful talking dolphins, enchanting merpeople, and gentle giants, who share their stories and experiences with the encroaching darkness. Prince Alexander discovers that an ancient and vengeful force has been awakened from its eternal slumber, unleashing its destruction upon the ocean. With the guidance of Leviathan, the prince embraces his birthright to protect his people and the ocean which connects them all. In the epic finale, Prince Alexander, Leviathan, and the united inhabitants of the ocean engage in a fierce battle against the dark force. Through courage, sacrifice, and the unwavering power of unity, they succeed in defeating the ancient evil and saving their kingdom. As the people of Marinia rejoice in their victory, Prince Alexander gains a newfound appreciation for his duty as the future king and the crucial need to preserve the delicate balance between their world and the sea. He commits to fostering this harmonious relationship for generations to come, ensuring a prosperous future for all. The movie ends with Alexander, now wiser and more confident, standing alongside Elara, his father, and Leviathan, looking out at the horizon as the Festival of Whales continues in full celebration."},{"instruction":"After losing an extra-inning game in Game 1, the Cubs rallied and took a 3 games to 1 lead over the Wild Card Florida Marlins in the NLCS. Florida shut the Cubs out in Game 5, but young pitcher Mark Prior led the Cubs in Game 6 as they took a 3–0 lead into the 8th inning and it was at this point when a now-infamous incident took place. Several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Luis Castillo. A Chicago Cubs fan by the name of Steve Bartman, of Northbrook, Illinois, reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of Moisés Alou for the second out of the 8th inning. Alou reacted angrily toward the stands, and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball. Alou at one point recanted, saying he would not have been able to make the play, but later said this was just an attempt to make Bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten. Interference was not called on the play, as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall. Castillo was eventually walked by Prior. Two batters later, and to the chagrin of the packed stadium, Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez misplayed an inning ending double play, loading the bases and leading to eight Florida runs and a Marlin victory.

The late actress wore the slippers in \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" The 10-year anniversary of the theft is in August. The reward offer requires the exact location of the slippers and the perpetrator's name. The slippers were insured for 1 million. John Kelsch, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minn., says they could be worth 2 million to 3 million now. Kelsch says the donor is from Arizona and is a huge fan of Garland and the 1939 movie. Three other pairs created for the film are known to exist, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Another pair was acquired in 2012 for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences' planned museum. If you have information about the shoes' whereabouts contact the Grand Rapids Minnesota Police Department at (218) 326-3464. ||||| August will mark 10 years since somebody stole a pair of the ruby slippers that Dorothy clicked together three times to get home to Kansas in The Wizard of Oz from The Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Now an anonymous benefactor has stepped forward and offered a million dollar reward to anyone with credible information about the theft, including the exact location of the slippers and the perpetrator’s name. The slippers, designed for the 1939 film by legendary Hollywood costumer Adrian, were stolen from the museum, located in Garland’s hometown, in 2005, and haven’t been seen since. John Kelsch, executive director of the museum told the Associated Press that the bounty’s donor is from Arizona and is a huge fan of Garland and the 1939 movie. At the time of the theft, the ruby slippers, which owe their glitter to burgundy sequins, were insured for 1 million. Kelsch says they could be worth 2 million to 3 million now. The last pair to hit the auction block took in 666,000 in 2000. In L. Frank Baum’s Oz books, on which the film was based, Dorothy's magical shoes were silver, but according to the Smithsonian, screenwriter Noel Langley changed them to ruby red—possibly so they would stand out better against a yellow brick road. After the film was made, the ruby slippers were stored in MGM’s wardrobe department and more or less forgotten. In 1970 a pair was discovered in MGM’s basement and sold at auction for 15,000 to a still-anonymous buyer, who donated them to the Smithsonian, where they are still on display. Another pair was acquired in 2012 for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences' planned museum. Two other pairs, including the stolen set, are known to exist. If you have information about the shoes’ whereabouts contact the Grand Rapids Minnesota Police Department at (218) 326-3464. ||||| The footwear is among the most treasured memorabilia in movie history A 1m reward has been offered for information leading to the recovery of the famous red slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the Wizard Of Oz. The sequined, ruby shoes were stolen 10 years ago from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, hometown of the late actress. An anonymous donor from Arizona, who is a big fan of Garland and the 1939 film, has put up the money, said John Kelsch, the museum's executive director. The reward requires the precise location of the slippers and the name of the thief. Garland, who died in 1969, as Dorothy Last month, Minnesota police checked out a tip that the slippers had been sealed in Tupperware with a weight inside and thrown into an underwater pit. Dives at the 238ft (72 metre) deep Tioga Mine Pit, in Ithaca County around Grand Rapids, recovered items possibly linked to the case, but no sign of the actual slippers. The glass case containing the shoes, which were insured for 1m, was smashed with a bat at the museum in August 2005. The museum says the footwear could now be worth between 2m and 3m. There are only three other pairs, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Dorothy wore silver slippers in the L Frank Baum book on which the movie was based. But the film's producers changed the shoes' colour to red to make the most of the new Technicolor process. The gingham dress Garland wore in the movie sold last November for 480,000 at an auction in Beverly Hills. ||||| Last week, Itasca County Sheriff's Office volunteer divers looked for the ruby slippers that were worn by Grand Rapids native Judy Garland in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and were infamously stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids almost a decade ago. The slippers didn't turn up during the four public dives in the Tioga Mine Pit, said Rob Feeney, the museum's volunteer in charge of acquisitions. But in a practice dive about a week earlier, one of the divers came up with what Feeney coyly described as \\"something that was of interest.\\" Actually, two somethings: a pair of containers, one a small duffel bag and the other a partially deteriorated tin can. It was apparent the can had been in the bag, Feeney said. \\"They had been down there a while.\\" The dives were staged at the mine pit, Feeney said, because of longstanding rumors that the slippers — stolen in August, 2005 — had been sealed in Tupperware with a weight inside and tossed in the pit. The thought that the can and the duffel bag might have contained something was enough reason to turn them over to the Grand Rapids Police Department, Feeney said. As of Monday, police were still examining the items, he said. Divers didn't discover anything that possibly could have been slipper-related during their public dives, Feeney said. But they did come up, unexpectedly, with a rifle. That, too, remains in police hands. It might not be all that easy to find a pair of slippers in the Tioga Mine Pit. Although a mere blip among Itasca County's numerous bodies of water, it still covers 51 acres and reaches a depth of 225 feet, according to Minnesota Lake Finder. The search for the iconic slippers isn't over, Feeney said. \\"This is really just the beginning,\\" he said. \\"We're never going to stop doing this until they're found or we know what happened to them.\\" He noted that the statute of limitations on the burglary soon will have run out, perhaps making the miscreant(s) more willing to speak up. Meanwhile, two individuals have expressed interest in making offers for a carriage that's on display at the museum. Museum co-founder Jon Miner owns the carriage, which was made for President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and later appeared in about 200 movies, including \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" (As if it needs any more creds, it also appeared in John Wayne's last movie, Feeney said.) Feeney said that Miner is interested in selling the carriage — for the right price — to bolster the endowment for the Children's Discovery Museum, which is attached to the Judy Garland Museum. |||||","output":"An anonymous donor has offered a 1 million reward for credible information leading to the recovery of a pair of Judy Garland's ruby red slippers that were stolen from a museum in her Minnesota hometown.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ...

I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed.

D'Cunha's aunt was the casting director for director Dev Benegal's film English, August and suggested that Bose should play the lead role. After filming a screen test, Benegal decided to cast him as civil servant Agastya Sen. Based on the novel of the same name by Upamanyu Chatterjee, English, August was one of the first Hinglish films and gained Bose international recognition when it became the first Indian film to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and won several awards at international film festivals. After English, August Bose found work in television; he was offered a role in India's first English-language television serial, A Mouthful of Sky and also co-hosted BBC World's Style! with Laila Rouass. In 1998 he appeared in Kaizad Gustad's Bombay Boys with Naseeruddin Shah and starred in Dev Benegal's second film, Split Wide Open. To prepare for his role as a roving water vendor, Bose lived in Mumbai's slums and observed a drug dealer for two weeks. He later cited this time--along with the 2002 Gujarat riots--as the beginning of the awakening of his social conscience. Although Split Wide Open was controversial in India because of its depictions of sexual abuse, Bose received the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Actor at the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival for his performance. He also performed abroad in the Leicester Haymarket in England where he starred in the English version of Tim Murari's play, The Square Circle. In 1997, Bose was cast to play the role of Saleem Sinai in the BBC adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children. The project was eventually canceled after the Indian and Sri Lankan governments refused to allow filming. After seeing Bose in English, August, director Govind Nihalani cast him in the villain role opposite Ajay Devgan in the mainstream film Thakshak.

Given these facts, moss can cause the breakdown of what among the following options: - water - mushrooms - Limbs - rocks - cactus - tissue - biome - Engine A:","output":"Moss can cause the breakdown of rocks among the given options. Here is a detailed explanation: Moss is a small, non-vascular plant that usually grows in damp or shady locations. It does not have true roots, stems, or leaves like most other plants, but it does play an important role in ecosystems, particularly in terms of chemical weathering. The process of chemical weathering generally occurs when rocks are exposed to various elements, such as water, air, and living organisms like moss. The chemical reactions weaken the rock structure and lead to the disintegration of the minerals that compose it. When moss grows on rocks, it collects and retains moisture, creating a perfect environment for chemical reactions to occur. As moss grows and expands, it secretes organic acids and other chemicals that break down the rock surface. This process of chemical weathering is known as bioweathering or biogenic weathering. Two primary chemicals released by moss that contribute to the breakdown of rocks are humic acid and carbonic acid. Humic acid is derived from decayed organic matter, while carbonic acid forms when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in water. These acids react with minerals in the rocks, weakening their internal structure and facilitating their breakdown. Moss can also act as a physical agent of weathering. As the moss grows and adheres to the rock surface, it can cause cracks and other physical alterations in the rock. During the freezing-thawing cycle, moss can hold moisture on the rock surface, which can freeze and expand, causing the rock to crack and disintegrate even further. Overall, moss not only triggers chemical reactions that lead to the decomposition of rock minerals but also contributes to the mechanical breakdown of rocks due to its growth pattern and ability to retain moisture. Out of the provided options – water, mushrooms, limbs, rocks, cactus, tissue, biome, and engine – it is clear that moss primarily causes the breakdown of rocks through chemical weathering and associated processes."},{"instruction":"This task is about translating a given English language sentence to Spanish.

The 31-year-old man’s naked body was found by a tourist in a dried-out part of the moat, while the woman was found later in 1.5 metres of water.

Article: The Lunar New Year, which starts in late January this year, is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families. It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight.

Answer:","output":"Colorado became part of the United States through a series of historical events related to westward expansion and territorial acquisitions. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of when Colorado became part of the United States, it's essential to dive into the history leading up to Colorado's eventual statehood. The land that is now Colorado was initially inhabited by various Indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish were the first Europeans to explore the area and lay a territorial claim. The Spanish influence extended through the southwestern part of the territory, while the northeastern areas were claimed by French fur traders in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson sought to expand the United States and initiated the Louisiana Purchase, which involved acquiring vast territories from France. This purchase extended the United States' western border and included parts of what is now eastern Colorado. While this was the initial introduction of Colorado lands into the United States, it was not an official incorporation just yet. As for the remaining portions of Colorado not included in the Louisiana Purchase, the western sections belonged to Spain as part of the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, these lands became part of the Mexican territory. In the mid-19th century, a series of conflicts and treaties defined the fate of the land that now makes up Colorado. The Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819 settled the boundary between Spanish territories and the United States, while the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United States and Great Britain clarified the northern border. After the Mexican-American War, which took place between 1846 and 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in February 1848. This treaty officially ceded territories, including parts of present-day Colorado, from Mexico to the United States. Although by this point the majority of Colorado was part of the United States, it would take several more years for the region to become an organized territory. The United States Congress created the Territory of Colorado on February 28, 1861, consolidating parts of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Utah territories. This territorial designation was the final step before Colorado would be officially incorporated into the United States as a state. Over the next 15 years, Colorado's population increased rapidly due to the gold and silver rush, prompting a push for statehood. Finally, on August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state. Known as \\"Centennial State\\" because it became a state 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Colorado had officially become part of the United States."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vie est un long fleuve tranquille, et nous naviguons tous sur ses eaux, rencontrant des épreuves, des joies, des émotions et des expériences qui façonnent notre existence.\\" This French sentence translates to \\"Life is a long tranquil river, and we all navigate its waters, encountering trials, joys, emotions and experiences that shape our existence.\\""},{"instruction":"Aubrey sung the song loud so everyone could hear.

Lisa had cancer, while her sister Beth didn't. Lisa was terrified, but her sister comforted her. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sister had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. A:","output":"Based on the provided information and the given paragraph, the sister who had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably is Beth. To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first recap the main points from the paragraph: 1. Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. 2. It is usually caused by mutations in genes that control the cell cycle. 3. Abnormal cells divide uncontrollably, often leading to the development of a tumor. 4. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen. In the initial scenario, we were informed that Lisa had cancer while her sister, Beth, did not. Since cancer is a disease caused by abnormal cell division, we can logically conclude that Lisa's body contained a higher number of abnormal cells that were dividing out of control, as compared to Beth. This is due to the mutations present in Lisa's genes that control the cell cycle, which led to the development of cancer. On the other hand, Beth's body did not exhibit the same genetic mutations or the uncontrollable division of cells, hence she did not develop cancer. In conclusion, Beth is the sister who had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably, as she did not have cancer. Meanwhile, Lisa had a higher number of abnormal cells dividing out of control, which led to the development of her cancer."},{"instruction":"Facts: - instrument: tabla , piano , drums , guitar , saxophone - years active: 1972 -- present - birth name: alokesh lahiri - origin: kolkata , west bengal , india - label: bl , t-series , tips industries , universal music group , sound studios , planet la records , saregama , venus records & tapes - spouse: chitrani lahiri - genre: film theatre , classical score , disco , rock , pop , - children: rema lahiri , bappa lahiri - birth date: 27 november 1952 - name: bappi lahiri - background: non_performing_personnel - image: bappi lahiri 2012.jpg - occupation: composer actor & producer , music director , singer , performer , Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of bappi lahiri .

Choose your answer from: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","output":"3). No. It is not possible to conclude that \\"My mind was crystal clear\\" if your mind was still quite jumbled. These two statements are contradictory and describe opposite states of mental clarity. A jumbled mind refers to a state of confusion, disorganization, or chaos, often resulting from an overload of information, emotions, or stress. In this state, it can be challenging to think and make decisions, as thoughts and ideas can be tangled and unclear. A jumbled mind may also involve racing thoughts, anxiety, or an inability to focus on a specific issue or task. On the other hand, a crystal clear mind signifies a mental state of complete clarity, organization, and focus. In this state, thoughts and ideas are coherent and easily accessible, allowing for efficient decision-making and problem-solving. A crystal clear mind is associated with calmness, serenity, and an ability to concentrate on tasks without distractions. Given that these two concepts represent opposing mental states, it is not possible for both to be true simultaneously. If your mind is jumbled, it cannot simultaneously be crystal clear. In such cases, you may need to engage in relaxation techniques, mindfulness practices, or problem-solving strategies to help move from a state of mental chaos to a state of clarity and focus."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Mrs. Smith: Excuse me?

And millions more people, especially in Asia, want to buy them. But could another explanation be that many more women are now buying gems for themselves? That is the theory being put forward by one of Hatton Garden's most established jewellers. Vashi Dominguez, the founder of the firm Diamond Manufacturers, believes prices are now being driven by the choices that women make. When men choose gemstones for their partners, they often go for diamonds, he says. But when they do the choosing themselves, many women prefer at least one coloured gemstone in a piece of jewellery - a ruby, a sapphire, or an emerald. They have also received encouragement from celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Penelope Cruz, who can afford diamonds aplenty, but who often choose to wear sapphires and emeralds instead. Not to mention the Duchess of Cambridge, with the engagement ring she inherited from Princess Diana. \\"I have a thing about colour - amethysts and rubies,\\" says Georgina Rycyk, a marketing manager in Hatton Garden, the centre of the UK's jewellery trade. She has just bought herself what she describes as a \\"sizeable\\" ruby. \\"I just really like colours. My budget is not in diamonds, although it might be one day,\\" she says. Many customers appear to think along similar lines. Even if they still want one diamond in an engagement ring, they also want a splash of colour. \\"What women want is a vintage setting, with coloured side stones,\\" says Ms Rycyk. Demand for coloured stones has increased threefold since 2010, according to Diamond Manufacturers' Mr Dominguez. As a result, the company is selling fewer diamonds. \\"It's because women are driving the market,\\" he says, \\"even in China.\\" If men choose jewellery, he says, they tend to buy a ring with a single diamond in it, otherwise known as a solitaire. \\"Buying jewellery is normally a very daunting experience for a man,\\" he says. \\"Often they don't even know the ring size, while women really know what they want. Some women even say, 'Can you change the diamonds to sapphires?'\\" Georgina Rycyk believes most men are fishing in the dark when it comes to choosing jewellery for a wife or girlfriend. \\"If I was to go into a sports shop to buy a pair of football boots, I would have no idea what to look for,\\" she says. Source: Gemval/RAPI \\"It's the same when men try to buy jewellery.\\" The market price of coloured stones appears to reflect their growing popularity around the globe. Gemval, which claims to offer the world's first online valuation tool for gemstones, reckons that the price of sapphires rose by 37% between January 2006 and January 2013. Rubies rose by 47% over the same period. Emeralds rose significantly in 2005, but between 2006 and 2013 only rose by about 6%. According to the RapNet Diamond Index (RAPI), the price for one-carat diamonds has risen by 32% since 2006. In other words, sapphires and rubies have outpaced diamonds over the past seven years. But the science of pricing such gems is not exact. \\"The problem with coloured stones is that there is no grading,\\" says Martin Rapaport, whose company produces the RapNet index at its headquarters in Israel. \\"But if you want a top quality ruby or emerald, they will compete with diamonds at that level,\\" he says. Jaspreet Chawla, a London-based gemmologist, believes the price rises reflect a growing trend in certain markets. \\"In the US and Germany there is a more pronounced move towards coloured stones,\\" she says, \\"increasingly so after Kate Middleton wore a sapphire. \\"But the UK is still diamond-dominated.\\" Celebrities may indeed be helping to make coloured gemstones fashionable. Penelope Cruz and Elizabeth Hurley both have sapphire rings, while Halle Berry and Angelina Jolie are fans of emeralds. Chloe Fuller, a marketing manager from south-west London, bought herself a blue sapphire ring for Â£900, and a sapphire necklace for Â£700, after inheriting money from her grandmother. She dreams of being able to afford a pair of sapphire ear-rings to match. \\"Before Kate, everyone was buying solitaires,\\" she says. \\"But now a lot of my friends have sapphire rings like this. They're classic, and they won't date. \\"I also wear lots of blue, so it goes with what I wear,\\" she says. But she dismisses suggestions that men are not good at choosing jewellery for their partners. She brandishes a bracelet with a miniature ice cream attached. \\"My boyfriend gave me this, because I like ice cream. I like it, because it's what he likes. \\"It's the thought that counts.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the growing popularity and demand for colored gemstones like rubies, sapphires, and emeralds in the global market, with prices being driven by women's preferences.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

What is the answer?","output":"Trichology is the specialized field of medical science that primarily focuses on the study, diagnosis, and treatment of hair and scalp disorders and conditions. The term \\"trichology\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"trichos,\\" which means hair. This branch of dermatology encompasses a wide range of concerns, including hair loss, hair texture problems, scalp infections, and disorders related to the hair growth cycle. A Trichologist is a professional who has been trained to assess and identify hair and scalp conditions, recommend appropriate treatment plans, and can advise on the potential causes of hair loss or other hair-related issues. They are not medical doctors but are experts in the specific field of hair and scalp care. The study of trichology addresses the following aspects: 1. Hair structure and growth: Trichology involves understanding the anatomy and physiology of hair, its function, and the changes that occur in the hair growth cycle. Hair is mainly composed of a protein called keratin, and it goes through various stages of growth – the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Trichologists study these patterns and their connection to various hair and scalp conditions. 2. Hair loss and thinning: One of the primary concerns in trichology is the study and treatment of hair loss, also known as alopecia. Hair loss can be caused by various factors such as genetics, hormonal imbalances, aging, poor nutrition, stress, and specific medications or medical treatments. There are different types of alopecia, including androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and cicatricial alopecia, each requiring different treatments and management techniques. 3. Scalp conditions: Trichologists study and address various scalp disorders, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, psoriasis, fungal infections, and other inflammatory or infectious conditions that can affect the skin on the scalp. These issues can influence the health and growth of the hair and require appropriate treatment to maintain a healthy scalp environment. 4. Hair texture and breakage issues: Trichology also tackles hair texture issues like brittle, dry, or damaged hair resulting from heat, chemicals, or environmental factors. Trichologists can provide advice and recommendations on proper hair care techniques, products, and treatments to prevent further damage and improve overall hair health. 5. Diagnostic techniques and tools: Trichologists perform a detailed examination of the hair and scalp, which may include hair pull tests, hair density exams, and scalp analysis using a trichoscope or other specialized equipment. This helps them determine the underlying cause of hair and scalp issues and develop a personalized treatment plan. 6. Treatment and management: Based on the patient's specific needs, trichologists can develop a customized treatment plan that may involve topical or oral medications, laser therapy, hair transplantation, nutritional supplementation, and lifestyle modifications. 7. Preventative care and maintenance: Trichologists can provide education and guidance on maintaining healthy hair and scalp, including selecting suitable hair care products, proper hair care techniques, and lifestyle choices that promote hair growth and reduce potential hair issues. In conclusion, trichology is a vital branch of medical science that deals with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of various hair and scalp conditions. A trichologist can play a crucial role in addressing and managing these concerns - from hair loss to infections - and can help individuals maintain healthy hair throughout their lives."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Malayalam.

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and...

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

(Associated Press) MEXICO CITY (AP) — Archaeologists at Mexico's Teotihuacan ruins have found evidence that the city's builders dug a tunnel beneath the Pyramid of the Moon and researchers said one of its purposes may have been to emulate the underworld. The National Institute of Anthropology and History said researchers used a kind of computerized tomography scan to discover the apparent tunnel about 30 feet (10 meters) below the surface of the plaza in front of the pyramid. The CT scan suggests the tunnel may have been filled in antiquity. Other tunnels have been discovered at Teotihuacan, and one at Temple of the Plumed Serpent has been explored. Experts say the tunnels may be associated with sacred flows of water and the underworld. \\"The discovery would confirm that the inhabitants of Teotihuacan followed the same pattern in their large-scale temples, and that their function would be to emulate the underworld,\\" said INAH archaeologist Veronica Ortega. More studies are needed to determine whether the apparent tunnel should eventually be excavated. The ruins north of Mexico City remain shrouded in mystery. Teotihuacan had its apex between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750, with about 100,000 residents. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century. The 340-foot (103-meter) tunnel found under the Temple of the Plumed Serpent early in this century yielded relics from ranging from seeds to pottery to animal bones. Researchers have still to find the tombs of the city's elite that they had hoped might be in the tunnel. Unlike at other pre-Columbian ruins in Mexico, archaeologists have never found any remains believed to belong to Teotihuacan's rulers. Such a discovery could help shine light on the leadership structure of the city, including whether rule was hereditary. ||||| A secret passageway discovered near the Pyramid of the Moon in the ancient city of Teotihuacan may have been a way for the people there to emulate the underworld, archaeologists said. Scans of what appears to be a hidden underground tunnel show that the cavity extends from the center of the Plaza of the Moon to the Pyramid of the Moon, reported archaeologists from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The finding confirms that the ancient people of Teotihuacan dug tunnels under their monuments, possibly to emulate the underworld — a place where life, plants and food were thought to be created, said archaeologist Verónica Ortega, director of the Integral Conservation Project of the Plaza de la Luna. [In Photos: Enormous Ancient Mexican Temple] The Pyramid of the Moon was built in seven different stages, from 100 B.C. to A.D. 450, the researchers said. It began as a small platform and eventually grew into a 150-foot-tall (46 meters) pyramid that held tombs filled with human and animal sacrifices, Live Science previously reported. Researchers found the tunnel in early June by using an electrical tomography scan, the INAH reported. To implement the scan, the researchers injected electric current into the subsoil and measured the resistance of the different materials found there. Then, they used the resulting data to create preliminary 2D and 3D models. Researchers placed electrodes in the ground by the ancient temple so they could map the electrical current throughout the soil. Credit: Melitón Tapia/INAH These models indicated that the straight tunnel is about 30 feet (10 m) below ground, the researchers said. The tunnel likely served as a place for rituals — possibly to carry out ceremonies for the different agricultural cycles — and will help experts understand more about the culture's symbolic discourse, the researchers said.

Credit: Denisse Argote/INAH The newfound tunnel isn't the only one in Teotihuacan: The Pyramid of the Sun and the Temple of the Feathered Serpent also have underground conduits, the researchers said. It's possible that the region's ancient leaders used the symbolism surrounding these tunnels as a way to unite the more than 100,000 local and foreign people who lived there, Ortega said. Researchers said they hope to explore the newfound tunnel soon and determine when it was built. When the tunnel under the Pyramid of the Sun was discovered in the 1970s, archaeologists were disappointed to learn that it had been looted, likely by the Mexica (the indigenous people in the Valley of Mexico) in the early 16th century, the researchers said. It's possible that the newfound tunnel could provide information about the Teotihuacan people that was taken from the cavity under the Pyramid of the sun, the researchers said. Furthermore, the study of the newfound tunnel could reveal whether there are more tunnels around the pyramid, as archaeologists detected some alterations in the subsoil last year, particularly in large pits and channels that were likely used for rituals. \\"These elements indicate that before the construction of the pyramid, there was a sacralization [performing sacred rites throughout it] of the space, since green megalithic stones have been found in front of the building,\\" Ortega said. \\" [These stones] were very valuable for Teotihuacan… although at the moment it is unknown if they have any relation with the possible tunnel.\\" A side view of the majestic temple. Future research will show whether there is a tunnel, and whether it contains artifacts.

The Pyramid of the Moon is the second largest structure at the site after the Pyramid of the Sun, rising to 140 feet (43 metres). Human sacrifices and other bloody rituals are thought to have taken place at the site, as human remains from burial sites suggest. A team from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) were excavating the large central square by the Pyramid of the Moon, known as Plaza de la Luna, when they came across a cavity below the ground. Other similar features have previously been discovered in recent years below other buildings at Teotihuacán, including one tunnel at the Temple of the Plumed Serpent. A representation of the underworld The newly discovered tunnel is long, going from the centre of the square to the pyramid. Archaeologists believe it might represent the underworld, in the complex belief system of this ancient pre-Colombian civilisation. \\"The finding confirms that Teotihuacans reproduced the same pattern of tunnels associated with their great monuments, whose function had to be the emulation of the underworld,\\" said archaeologist Verónica Ortega, who leads the conservation project of the Plaza de la Luna. The tunnel was discovered at the beginning of June, when the archaeologists used a method known as electrical resistivity tomography, which involves imaging structures located beneath the Earth from electrical measurements made at the surface. They have not accessed it directly but with this method, they were able to reveal a 10-metre-deep cavity was hidden below the ground, going from the square to the pyramid. Now, the researchers will have to conduct more investigations to learn more about the features of this tunnel and find out what purpose it would have served. They think it might contain artefacts, but more research will have to be conducted to confirm the presence of the tunnel before it can be explored. Nevertheless, the discovery might represent an important step to understand the culture of the ancient civilisation who built the Pyramid of the Moon some 2,000 years ago. \\"The function of the tunnel may have been to reproduce the underworld, a world where life, animals and plants originated. It's possible that it was used purely for rituals, as part of ceremonies to celebrate the agricultural cycles,\\" Ortega pointed out. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Archaeologists have discovered a secret tunnel under the Pyramid of the Moon in the ancient city of Teotihuacan in Mexico.

Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy. A:","output":"Black Francis is the frontman for the band Pixies. In the article provided, it discusses the band's reunion in 2004 after their split in 1993 and their collaboration on creating a new song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The Pixies chose a composition from Kim Deal, who also had her own band called The Breeders. Throughout their earlier years, Black Francis served as the principal songwriter for the Pixies' albums, such as Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991). Deal's minimal contributions during those years led to tensions that eventually resulted in the band's original breakup. However, during the creation of \\"Bam Thwok\\" for Shrek 2, the band members seemingly resolved their differences as seen in Black Francis' praise of the song and allowing Deal to take lead vocals on the track. Despite these improvements, in June 2013, Deal eventually left the band before the release of their next album, Indie Cindy."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"'These are business hours,' said Lincoln, humourlessly.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Lincoln spoke without a joking tone.\\" true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information in the premise.

Over the past decade, social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have grown exponentially in terms of usage, radically transforming how people interact and communicate with each other. The ubiquity of smartphones and cheap internet access has further proliferated the use of social media, with billions of users around the world. While social media has undoubtedly had many positive effects such as promoting communication, fostering global connections, and supporting online communities, there is a growing body of research that suggests a link between frequent social media use and the mental health of young individuals. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that excessive social media use has a detrimental impact on the mental health of adolescents and young adults, contributing to disorders such as anxiety, depression, feelings of loneliness, and negative self-esteem. This hypothesis posits that constant exposure to social media platforms exacerbates mental health concerns among young users by perpetuating unrealistic expectations of body image, enabling cyberbullying, fostering social comparisons, and driving constant concerns about social validation. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis can be collected through various research methods such as: 1. Longitudinal studies tracking social media usage and mental health indicators over time among adolescents and young adults. This can help uncover trends and correlations between increased social media use and the development of mental health issues. 2. Cross-sectional surveys and questionnaires administered to large samples of young individuals to gauge their self-reported levels of social media usage and mental health symptoms. This can provide valuable insights into the prevalence of various mental health issues in connection to social media habits. 3. Experimental studies that manipulate social media usage and then measure changes in mental health indicators. This can potentially offer insights into causality and highlight which aspects of social media contribute the most to mental health problems. 4. Qualitative research, including interviews and focus groups with young social media users, can offer more in-depth, personal narratives around their experiences and how social media affects their daily lives and mental wellbeing. 5. Finally, a meta-analysis of previous research studies on the subject can help identify prevailing trends and synthesize the collective knowledge from various sources, potentially strengthening the evidence for the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence. The ideal weather conditions for applying stucco involve an overcast day with low wind, and temperatures of 50 to 60ºF (10–16ºC). Delay the job if the temperature is expected to drop below 40ºF (4ºC) or rise above 90ºF (32ºC) in the next week. If the weather is sunny, store your stucco and sand under a tarp between uses. If they feel warm to the touch, don’t attempt to use either the stucco or the sand. You may stucco over any rigid material attached to your support studs. The most common surfaces for stucco are plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), cement board, and exterior grade gypsum sheathing. Make sure to follow local building codes while installing the sheathing material. It is possible to stucco over an open frame, but this results in a less even and less structurally secure wall. If you plan to go this route, drive nails halfway into the studs, spaced out vertically in 5-6 inch (13-15 cm) intervals. String line wire horizontally along the protruding nails. You may also use a draining house wrap such as Tyvek drainwrap. Most building codes require at least 2 layers of \\"Grade D\\" building paper or an equivalent water-resistant barrier. You may also use 15 lb per 100 square foot roofing felt (6.8 kg per 9.3 square meters) or some types of housewrap, but do not use a plastic housewrap not intended for stucco. Overlap the paper by at least 4 inches (10 cm) and fasten with roofing nails. Start at the bottom and overlap the paper or felt as you work your way up. While not required by most codes, an air gap between the 2 layers is highly recommended to prevent wall rot. A 3D plastic drainage mat between the 2 barriers is one way to accomplish this. Install casing bead as a plaster stop at the corners of doors and windows. Install weep screed at the base of the wall for better drainage. For this project, these 2 materials are not interchangeable. Selecting the correct lath and installing it properly is one of the more difficult parts of this project. Consulting a local contractor is recommended. In most cases, you should nail or staple the lath to the studs (not the sheathing) at no less than 7-inch (18 cm) intervals. Overlap the lath by at least ½ inch (1.25 cm) along the long side and 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the end, but not much more. Be sure to use only galvanized roofing nails or staples designed for use with stucco. Otherwise, your nails or staples will rust and pull loose. In all exterior stucco applications, you must use G-60 hot-dipped galvanized lath. Choose lath with at least ¼ inch (6mm) furring, or make up for non-furred lath using furring strips or furring nails. Without this furring, the stucco will not adhere properly to the lath. To reduce cracking, divide the wall into rectangular panels using control joints, spacing them no more than 18 ft (5.5 m) apart. Also install control joints wherever 2 dissimilar walls meet. If the lath is expanded metal (rather than stucco mesh), cut it behind each control joint to fully separate this rigid material into panels. Make the panels as close to square as possible, and no larger than 144 ft2 (13 m2). . Mix the scratch coat from 1 part cement material and 2¼ to 4 parts plaster sand. If you are using Type I Portland cement instead of plastic cement, you'll need to add your own hydrated lime; count the final cement and lime mixture as the \\"1 part cement.\\" Mix with just enough potable water that you can trowel the stucco; any more, and it is likely to sag. Make sure to use cool water when mixing your stucco, especially if your hose has been sitting in the sun. If the water is hot or warm, it will cause your stucco to dry too quickly. The aggregate in the cement should be clean and well graded. Apply the scratch coat with a square trowel at a 45º angle, firmly pushing it into the lath. This layer should be ⅜ inch (9.5 mm) thick. The first scratch coat should be thick enough to cover your wire grid. You may find it easier to use a hawk for some portions of the application. The first coat is called the \\"scratch coat\\" because of the shallow, horizontal lines scored into it by a notched trowel. This will ensure a good bond with the next coat. When stuccoing over stud construction, the thick scratch coat must be allowed to cure for 48 hours. During this time, it is critical to protect the stucco from drying out. Mist or fog the stucco twice daily unless the relative humidity is above 70%. Protect the wall with a windscreen or sunshade if necessary. You can also use a rotating lawn sprinkler to keep the stucco damp. Keep the sprinkler turned down to a low setting and pull it away from the house enough so that it keeps the surface damp without soaking it. Mix another batch using 1 part cement and 3 to 5 parts sand. Apply another ⅜ inch (9.5 mm) layer of stucco and screed to an even thickness, for a total thickness so far of ¾ inch (19 mm). Once the brown coat loses its sheen, float it smooth. Wet cure as you did the scratch coat, but this time allow at least 7 days. The first 48 hours are the most important, but you should continue to mist or fog it for this whole period, whenever it looks like it's about to dry. This final ⅛ inch (3 mm) layer determines the texture of your stucco wall. Apply and float it as you did the brown coat, but this time use 1 part cement to 1½ to 3 parts sand. You may purchase a finish which already contains pigment, or trowel on a plain finish and paint over it once it has had at least a week to cure. Colored stucco finishes work best in pastel shades. If the finish is colored, wetting the surface during floating may cause mottling. A fog coat may make the color more even. Many decorative textures are possible when applying this final layer. Judge the appearance from at least 30 feet (9m) back before settling on a look.

Today we're going to learn about a super fun project you can do at home using just an empty plastic bottle, a bucket or plastic container and some water. Are you ready? It's called the \\"Mini Fountain\\" and it's perfect for hot summer days when you want to play with water. Let's learn how to make it! Materials: To get started, grab these items from your home: 1. An empty plastic bottle (like a soda or water bottle) 2. A pair of scissors (ask an adult for help) 3. A bucket or a plastic container (it should be a little bigger than the bottle) 4. Some water! Now, let's start making our mini fountain! Step 1: Cut the bottom off the empty plastic bottle First, we need to give our bottle a haircut. Ask an adult to help you cut the bottom off the plastic bottle using the scissors. Be careful, and remember, always ask for help when using sharp tools! Step 2: Find a bigger bucket or plastic container Next, let's find a good home for our fountain. Look for a bucket or a plastic container that's a little bit bigger than the bottle you just cut. This will be the \\"pool\\" where our fountain will live. Step 3: Fill the bucket or container with water Now, it's time to get that fountain flowing! Grab the bucket or container that you found, and fill it up with water. Don't make it too full; just enough so it can hold the water as it splashes out from your fountain. Step 4: Put the cut bottle in the water Place the cut bottle, with its open bottom facing up, into the water-filled bucket or container. You can hold it with your hand or ask an adult to help you prop it up. Now, watch as the water goes into the bottle and comes pouring out like a mini fountain! Conclusion: Congratulations, you've just made your very own mini fountain! This simple, yet exciting project, is a great way to learn about recycling and enjoy a fun water play activity at the same time. You can even add a little twist by adding some food coloring to the water, decorating the bottle, or using different sized buckets to create a bigger fountain. The possibilities are endless!

He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB.

In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing.

At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum; but her health broke down on their honeymoon and, over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable. Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent - in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability. Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \\"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible.\\" Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular Athenaeum magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. What did he do once in the board of directors?","output":"Once elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company in December 1856, Thomson played a crucial role in the project.

To ask how someone is in Spanish, I need the following words/phrases: \\"cómo\\" (how), \\"estás\\" (are you), and \\"tú\\" (you). Additionally, I will use the common courtesy phrase \\"hola\\" (hello) to begin the sentence. Step 3: Arrange the words in the correct order for Spanish grammar. Spanish typically follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. However, in questions, the subject is often placed at the end of the sentence. Since \\"estás\\" is a second person verb (meaning it already implies \\"you\\" as the subject), we don't necessarily need to include \\"tú\\" explicitly in the sentence. Step 4: Create the sentence, combining the words and applying correct punctuation. The question should end with a question mark, and since this is a Spanish sentence, an inverted question mark should precede it as well.

Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism.

He won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot, setting a world record. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Abebe was the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title, breaking his own world record in the process. Abebe returned to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard. On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu began an unsuccessful coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie's eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting took place in the heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled. In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot. This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted. The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Kosice. While in Japan, he was approached by a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka Tiger, with the possibility of wearing its shoes; they were informed by Niskanen that Abebe had \\"other commitments.\\" Kihachiro Onitsuka suspected that Abebe had a secret sponsorship deal with Puma, in spite of the now-abandoned rules against such deals. Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, finishing fifth in 2:24:43, the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. Abebe won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why did Abebe returned as a hero?","output":"Abebe returned to his homeland a hero because he won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot, setting a world record, and then becoming the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, breaking his own world record in the process."},{"instruction":"The agency cites the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Does it follow that \\"The agency references the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\\"?","output":"Yes, when one states that \\"The agency cites the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.,\\" it is equivalent to saying \\"The agency references the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.\\" Both phrases indicate that the agency is using the Clean Air Act as a source or as support for their statement, decision, regulation, or any other related task. The words 'cite' and 'reference' are used interchangeably in this context and convey the same meaning. The Clean Air Act, which is codified under Title 42 of the United States Code, is a federal law enacted to control air pollution on a national level. The primary objective of this Act is to ensure public health and welfare by regulating the emissions of hazardous air pollutants and certain criteria pollutants from various sources. The Act was first passed in 1963 and has undergone several revisions and amendments since then. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the leading federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA achieves this goal by establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for specified pollutants, establishing emissions standards for stationary and mobile sources, regulating the production and use of several chemical substances, and developing comprehensive plans to address air quality in specific regions. The Clean Air Act has played a crucial role in achieving significant improvements in air quality in the United States. The law has been instrumental in reducing air pollution levels, eliminating approximately 70% of the aggregate emissions of six of the most prevalent pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, between 1970 to 2020. These reductions have led to improvements in public health, agriculture, ecosystems, and overall quality of life for millions of Americans. In conclusion, when one states that \\"The agency cites the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.,\\" it means that the agency is referring to the Clean Air Act and using its provisions to support a position or decision. The statement also implies that the agency recognizes the importance of the Clean Air Act and its role in maintaining and improving air quality across the United States."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple? , can you please find it? Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today).

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - Franklin is a city in Johnson County, Indiana, United States.

They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi Kürsch, guitarists André Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Nightfall in Middle-Earth is the sixth full-length studio album by German power metal band Blind Guardian. It was released on April 28, 1998 through Virgin Records. It is a concept album based upon J. R. R.

The album contains not only songs but also spoken parts narrating parts of the story. The cover represents Lúthien dancing in front of Morgoth. It is widely regarded as one of Blind Guardian's most well-known and well-received albums in their discography. It is also the first album with Oliver Holzwarth as guest musician, playing bass guitar instead of Hansi Kürsch. \\"Nightfall in Middle-Earth\\" was the first album by Blind Guardian to be released in the US.

It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" 'jon schaffer' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'given name'?

However, general flour (made from wheat) is not a significant source of calcium. Although it does contain a small amount of calcium, it is not an ideal source for calcium supplementation. Sentence B: \\"Milk powder supplements calcium in human body.\\" This statement suggests that consuming milk powder leads to an increase in calcium levels in the human body.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe have in common? The answer to this question is:","output":"While Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe are different in their specifics, they share a common thread as they both pertain to legally reinforced rights. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health (1990) and Bolling v. Sharpe (1954) are landmark cases in US legal history, but they pertain to different areas of law and rights. The commonality between the two is that both cases are concerned with the question of constitutionally protected rights and the tension between individual rights and state or societal interests. In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, the Supreme Court recognized an individual's constitutional right, under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, to refuse unwanted life-saving medical treatment. This emphasized the role of personal liberty and autonomy in constitutional rights, albeit the court upheld Missouri's requirement for clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wish to be removed from life support. On the other hand, Bolling v. Sharpe involved a ruling in which the Supreme Court interpreted the 5th Amendment's due process clause to include an equal protection component, thereby making segregation in the public schools of Washington, D.C., unconstitutional. This clarified the idea that constitutional rights extend to protection against discrimination. So in essence, both cases dealt with fundamental rights as interpreted by the US Supreme Court, albeit in different contexts. Both increased the scope of rights protected by the Constitution - Cruzan with respect to autonomy and personal liberty in medical decisions, and Bolling with respect to equal protection and non-discrimination."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: equipment,tosell\\"minesensors/mineneutralization\\"andareaskingcustomerstocontactB.RishøjChristensen,whowasdirectorforHoneywellA/SinDenmark.","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to do that for you!

When it opened in 1930, it was the largest building in the world, with 4,000,000 square feet (372,000 m2) of floor space. The art deco landmark is located at the junction of the Chicago River's branches. The building is a leading retailing and wholesale destination, hosting 20,000 visitors and tenants per day as of the late 2000s. Context: The Merchandise Mart was modernized in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Indian chiefs were removed and replaced with concrete plates in 1961, of minimal note to onlookers as skyscrapers did not rise on the north side of the river as predicted. Some of the carvings were later found in a suburban backyard and auctioned in 2014. In 1962, an entrance canopy was constructed over the south for vehicle use. In 1977, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the Chicago Apparel Center, located on the west side of Orleans Street, which increased the Merchandise Mart's total floor space to 6,200,000 square feet (580,000 m2). Making use of plazas, esplanades and overlooks employed the waterfront location for pedestrian pleasure. In 1988, Helmut Jahn designed an enclosed pedestrian walking bridge over Orleans Street connecting the Mart and the Apparel Center. After a 10-year, 100 million modernization in the late 1980s that included public utility upgrades, Beyer Blinder Belle's commission in 1989 was to create additional perimeter entrances and restore the display windows, main entrance and lobby. On the south facade, the drive-through canopy was removed and two smaller doorways aside the main entrance were added. Display windows, painted over during the earlier modernization campaign, were restored with clear glass to showcase merchant's wares. New main and corner entrances were added to the rear facade, and the loading dock that occupied the north portion of the first floor of the river level was removed in order to use the bottom deck of North Bank Drive. Improvements to the lobby included restoration of the original glass curtain wall over the entrance, shop fronts and reception desk using terrazzo floors and wall sconces influenced by the original design. The project was completed in 1991. In November 2007, the building received LEED for Existing Buildings Silver recognition. Question: Who pays for all of these expensive renovations? Answer:","output":"The people who own the building, called the building owners, are the ones who pay for all of these expensive renovations. They do this because they want to make the building nicer and more comfortable for the people who work there and visit the building.

After the explosion, the main character, Jake Hampton, discovers that his brother, Ethan, is already dead. Although there is no indication that Jake hugs anybody in this particular moment, it is possible that he would seek out emotional support from someone close to him. Later on, Jake might reconnect with his high-school sweetheart Amanda Spelling, who has returned to the village with her daughter Claire. The shared experience of facing the alien threat and the tragic death of Jake's brother could bring Jake and Amanda closer together. In this context, one could infer that Jake might hug Amanda for comfort and emotional support. Alternatively, he could hug Claire out of a desire to protect the innocent and vulnerable. Apart from these speculations, since Max is not mentioned in the provided movie plot, it is not possible to determine who Max would hug after the explosion.

It was the first time the Texans had ever defeated the Ravens in their franchise history (they had lost the previous six meetings, including the playoff matchup). Reliant Stadium set a new Texans home attendance record of 71,708 fans during the regular season. Likewise, the Ravens and Texans were the only 2 teams in the AFC who were above .500 at the point of this game. However, the Texans surprisingly won it as the team went into their bye week at 6-1 and also went 1-6 all-time against the Ravens. The Texans punted to the Ravens who kicked a field goal to take a 3-0 lead. 3 drives later, Joe Flacco was sacked in his own endzone. That gave Houston 2 points and the ball. It was 3-2. Matt Schuab found Kevin Walters to make it 9-3 at the end of the first. Then Flacco was picked off at the Houston 48. Jonathan Joseph ran it back 52 yards for a touchdown to make it 16-3.

Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\" Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\" Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. The CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly. Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\" It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season. The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been. After reading the above, is \\"FISA wiretap requests\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Following Ressam's arrest, which type of wiretap requests were being requested?\\"?

Here are possible answers to this question: - school children - parents - get money - require to pay taxes - take money I believe the correct choice is \\"school children\\", here's why: A:","output":"The government plays an essential role in the education sector, providing support and implementing policies that benefit various stakeholders. Among these stakeholders, school children, parents, educational institutions, and the public at large benefit from the government's assistance with schools. While the most direct beneficiaries are indeed school children, other groups also receive help through interconnected systems and policies. 1. School children: The primary beneficiaries of government assistance are the students themselves. Government-funded schools ensure that children have access to education, regardless of their financial background. This helps promote equal opportunity and contributes to reducing the social and economic divide. Apart from funding schools, the government also creates and enforces educational policies and standards to maintain a high quality of education. Governments often invest in special needs programs, school lunch initiatives, and extracurricular activities to provide a holistic learning experience. 2. Parents: Government assistance in schools also benefits parents by providing them with access to quality education for their children, often at little or no cost. This significantly reduces the financial burden borne by parents in private or homeschooling settings. Furthermore, government-funded childcare services enable working parents to achieve a better work-life balance, knowing their children are well taken care of during school hours. 3. Educational Institutions: Public schools, colleges, and universities all receive direct financial support from the government for various purposes, such as infrastructure development, maintenance, hiring qualified teachers and support staff, and procuring educational materials. Subsidized or free education allows these institutions to attract a diverse student body, fostering a more inclusive learning environment. 4. The Public: When public funds are allocated to education, the entire population reaps the benefits. Education contributes to the well-being of individuals and society as a whole, improving overall quality of life and economic prospects. Moreover, education often leads to a more well-informed, responsible, and engaged citizenry – invaluable assets to any functioning democracy. In conclusion, while school children are the most direct beneficiaries of government assistance in education, parents and other stakeholders also benefit from these efforts. A well-funded, robust education system leads to a more equitable, productive, and prosperous society, with benefits that extend far beyond the classroom walls."},{"instruction":"Context: The Bears began their season at Lambeau Field for a Sunday night battle with their hated rival, the Green Bay Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Packers kicker Mason Crosby got a 52-yard field goal.

For his next book, Jon Krakauer looked into a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana after he learned that a close family friend had been raped by a man she trusted. Mr Krakauer announced Monday that he would release 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town' on April 21. The best-selling author says that the story 'makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault'. He has previously written narrative non-fiction about topical issues, including a biography of football player and soldier Pat Tillman. The book's release in April follows several years where sexual assaults and how they are handled by universities have gotten increased attention. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012, according to Mr Krakauer's website. The Colorado-based journalist says the new book 'chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula' with both the police system and their university. The book purportedly tells how one district attorney testified for an alleged rapist during university proceedings against him. She later left the prosecutor's office, becoming an attorney for the university's star football player who was accused on rape. The Department of Justice began an investigation into Missoula County in May 2012 after receiving complaints about the way officials handled rapes reported by University of Montana students. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to training and special prosecutors for sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, according to the Montana Kaimin. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University attended the State of the Union with New York Senator Kristen Gillbrand after carrying a mattress around to classes in protest against her alleged attacker's continued presence on campus. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild. President Obama sent a pre-recorded message to the Grammys on Sunday urging artists to advocate against sexual and domestic violence. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Publisher Doubleday plans a first printing of 500,000 copies for the new book.","output":"Author Jon Krakauer's new book, \\"Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town,\\" investigates a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana, shedding light on the prevalence of rape on American campuses, and the reluctancy of victims to report these incidents. The book, set to release on April 21, follows several years of increased attention to sexual assaults and university handling of these incidents. In May 2012, the Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police. Krakauer's work focuses on Montana but has a broader scope, highlighting the need for compassion towards rape victims and the need for improvements in the justice system. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for mishandling sexual assault cases at the beginning of this year."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: I actually use it Review: I love this machine because the time flies when I use it and it's quiet so I don't have to blast the t.v.

It said public expectations of curbs on low-skilled migration must be met. The think tank has also released a survey suggesting almost half of Britons do not believe the government will reach its net migration targets. Ministers have pledged to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by 2020. British Future's report is published ahead of the release on Thursday of the latest net migration figures. Details of the number of people coming to the UK for more than a year from across the EU and the rest of the world will be published at 09:30 BST - covering the year to 31 March. Net migration - the difference between the estimated number of people settling in the UK and those emigrating - rose to 333,000 in 2015, the second highest figure on record, and has been above 300,000 for the past five quarters. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is sticking with her predecessor David Cameron's target of bringing the annual figure down to less than 100,000 - even though he fell well short of this during the last Parliament. Opposition parties and some Tories have called for the target to be ditched, arguing it is distorting priorities and will be unachievable even outside the EU. But ministers say it is still a valid benchmark for \\"sustainable\\" migration levels. In its report, British Future - which describes itself as a non-partisan body focused on addressing issues of migration, integration and identity - said the target was a \\"symbolic totem\\" for many and the failure to meet it had damaged public trust but it was unlikely to be reconsidered until the shape of the UK's Brexit deal became apparent. \\"After the referendum, the debate about the future of the headline target will have little practical impact until the contours of future UK immigration policy become clearer,\\" it wrote. \\"Nobody in government or outside of it could possibly be in a position to make a sensible long-term judgement about future immigration targets without knowing more about the Brexit deal itself, about prevailing conditions in the UK economy and their impact on inward and outward flows.\\" Instead, policymakers should focus on coming up with \\"workable alternatives\\" for presenting their objectives pending what it said should be a far-reaching review of immigration goals and a \\"national conversation\\" about future options. \\"Britain's current immigration system is broken and is not working for anybody,\\" it said. \\"Leaving the EU will have a major impact on almost all aspects of immigration policy. \\"While Brexit will present challenges for decision-makers, it also offers and opportunity to get policy right in this area and to help secure consent for the immigration that we have.\\" Meanwhile, British Future's survey of 2,400 people says 44% of those polled said the target was unlikely to be met in the next five years - even after Britain withdraws from the European Union. But 37% still thought the target was likely to be achieved. Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank, said: \\"Public trust in governments' competence to manage immigration - including meeting its own targets - is at rock bottom.\\" During the referendum, Leave campaigners said exiting the EU would allow the UK to determine who came into the country but mostly stopped short of saying greater controls would result in a fall in immigration. Brexit negotiations, which will not begin in earnest until the start of 2017 at the earliest, are likely to hinge on to what extent continued access to EU markets can be squared with limits on immigration from the EU. Thursday's report said it would be unacceptable for there to be no restrictions on the right of other EU citizens to come to live and work in the UK given the strong public support for this. And while the public broadly accepted the need for employers to be allowed to continue to recruit highly skilled migrants from across the world, it said, economic arguments for migration had fallen on deaf ears during the referendum and must be reconsidered - with more priority given to managing the consequent social pressures. As well as giving local authorities funding to mitigate the impact of immigration on public services, it said, more emphasis must be placed on helping integrate migrants in their new communities and bodies should be set up in all cities and regions with devolved mayors to coordinate approaches. Another think tank, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, said the net migration target should simply be abandoned in favour of separate targets for low-skilled and high-skilled immigration. \\"They say the definition of madness is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result,\\" its associate director Phoebe Griffith said. \\"Yet the government continue to stand by a net migration target that neither the public nor many ministers have confidence in. \\"Having a net migration target is like having a target for the number of sunny days in a year; it's not going to change the weather by itself. \\"The government need to design policy to balance public concerns with the needs of different sectors of our economy.\\" The IPPR's own research suggests there are currently about 55,000 EU nationals working in the English NHS, with one in 10 of the UK's registered doctors an EU national, and the health service would \\"collapse\\" without them. It said all EU nationals who work for, or as locums in, the NHS should be eligible to apply for British citizenship.

Percy Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Echoes of Madness\\" Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Drama Plot: Act 1: The movie opens in the once renowned but now dilapidated Wharton Asylum, situated in a remote corner of the English countryside. Newspapers, dating back decades, are plastered on the walls, hinting at the dark history that haunts the old institute. Percy, a brilliant but tormented young man in his 30s, arrives as a new patient. He is committed to the asylum by his family as they can no longer cope with his erratic and unstable behavior. Once at Wharton, Percy meets Dr. Colin, the asylum's psychiatrist with an unorthodox approach to mental health treatment. Dr. Colin insists that Percy's complex imagination and mysterious past are clues to unlocking the reason behind his illness. They start attending therapy sessions together, during which Percy narrates a series of bizarre stories, full of mystery and terror. Act 2: While exploring the derelict asylum, Percy unexpectedly encounters Eva, the granddaughter of one of the asylum's previous patients who had vanished inexplicably. A bond quickly forms between Percy and Eva, and the two begin to exchange tales of the asylum's dark past. Together they connect the dots, linking Percy's stories to actual events that took place at Wharton decades ago. Overwhelmed by their discoveries, Percy and Eva begin a quest to find the truth, repeatedly uncovering twisted secrets lurking in the now-abandoned wings of the institute. As they dig deeper, they uncover tragic personal histories that reveal the malevolent experiments that were once performed on patients. Act 3: Amidst their investigation, Percy and Eva form a plan to expose the atrocities that took place at Wharton. They start gathering evidence to present to the authorities. However, Dr. Colin, who gradually becomes more and more unstable throughout the movie, catches wind of their plan and attempts to sabotage their efforts with his terrifying madness. In a nerve-wracking confrontation, Percy, Eva, and Dr. Colin face off in the heart of Wharton Asylum. Percy uses his intelligence and newfound understanding of his past to outwit Dr. Colin, bringing him to realize the extent of his own insanity. Defeated, Dr. Colin is subsequently institutionalized as a patient in the very asylum he once worked. Conclusion: Having succeeded in exposing the past's horrors and freeing himself from the grip of madness, Percy is released and embarks on a new life with Eva's support. Together, they work tirelessly to bring closure and justice to the souls who suffered under Wharton Asylum's roof. As the movie ends, we see that the once decrepit asylum is being renovated into a haven of hope and rehabilitation – a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of darkness."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: They make me feel guilty.

Formed in 2004, the group now consists of vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has been described primarily as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on later albums. Among Bring Me the Horizon's earliest influences were bands like At the Gates, Carcass, Pantera, Metallica, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Skycamefalling and Poison the Well; and genres death metal, grindcore, and emo have been cited by AllMusic writer Steward Mason. However, as their sound developed, the band started to take influences from progressive rock, post-rock, dubstep and electronica. The band's musical style has been described mainly as metalcore and - though they have since moved on from the genre - their early material was considered deathcore. Across their career the band has also been said to play within the genres post-hardcore, hardcore punk, technical metal, heavy metal, and emo. Bring Me the Horizon have attempted to grow and change with each album, believing they should be different. Raziq Rauf, writing for Drowned In Sound, described Count Your Blessings as possessing \\"Norma Jean-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny.\\" Metal Hammer described Suicide Season as a \\"creative, critical and commercial success\\" for the band as they started to adopt a more eclectic style, with its \\"crushingly heavy party deathcore\\". Leading up to its release Oliver Sykes described it as \\"100% different to Count Your Blessings\\" and noted the album sounds \\"more rock than metal\\". As time went by, Bring Me the Horizon began rejecting their debut album Count Your Blessings and considered Suicide Season as their \\"Year Zero[...] [their] wipe-the-slate-clean time\\". Bring Me the Horizon then moved even further away from deathcore with their third album There Is a Hell, which incorporated electronica, classical music and pop music into their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks. For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music. Bring Me the Horizon has experimented with its music in recent years, mixing pop with metal music, leading the band to be labeled a \\"pop metal\\" act. With the release of That's the Spirit, their sound shifted towards alternative metal and alternative rock, also incorporated other genres such as pop rock and nu metal, while completely abandoning the metalcore sound of their earlier albums.
