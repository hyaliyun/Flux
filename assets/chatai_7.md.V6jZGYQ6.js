Information:  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - The Temple of Elemental Evil is a 2003 role - playing video game by Troika Games . It is a remake of the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure of the same title using the 3.5 edition rules . This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting , and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set . The game was published by Atari , who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise . The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003 and was criticized for stability issues and other bugs . The turn - based tactical combat , however , was generally thought to be implemented well , and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then - current tabletop role - playing game ( \`\` 3.5e '' ) rules in a video game .  - Troika Games was a video game developer co-founded by Jason Anderson, Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky. The company was focused on role-playing video games between 1998 and 2005, best known for \\"\\" and \\"\\".  - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand.  - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview.  - Tim Cain is an American video game developer best known as the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \\"Fallout\\". In 2009 he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Leonard Boyarsky is an American computer game designer and visual artist best known for being one of the key designers of the video games \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Diablo III\\".  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983.  - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.  - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.

Jason managed their fortune well.. ii. Joel managed their fortune well..","output":"Jason got into a deep financial hole, unlike Joel, because he lacked the necessary financial skills, discipline, and foresight that were essential for managing their fortunes effectively. While Jason's approach to handling money was marked by reckless spending, poor investment choices, and an inability to plan for the future, Joel's diligent and prudent money management skills allowed him to preserve and grow their wealth over time. First and foremost, Jason had a propensity for indulging in extravagant purchases, often on a whim. He would spend exorbitant amounts of money on flashy cars, designer clothes, and high-end gadgets, without considering the long-term impact of these expenses on his financial health. Furthermore, he had a tendency to live beyond his means, accumulating credit card debt at an alarming pace, which only exacerbated his already precarious financial situation. In stark contrast, Joel possessed a strong understanding of the importance of living within one's means. He was mindful of his spending and prioritized saving and investing a portion of his income regularly. Joel also recognized the value of frugal living and made conscious decisions to cut unnecessary expenses. This allowed him to maintain a healthy cash flow and avoid the dangers of accruing debt. Another factor that contributed to Jason's financial demise was his poor investment choices. He often fell prey to get-rich-quick schemes and high-risk investments, lured by the promise of rapid wealth accumulation. Unfortunately, many of these ventures ended in loss, further draining his limited resources and pushing him deeper into the financial abyss. Additionally, Jason had a weak grasp of the principles of diversification, and as a result, his investment portfolio presented a high degree of risk with minimal upside potential. On the other hand, Joel approached investing with a long-term perspective, focusing on steady and consistent growth. He conducted thorough research and sought advice from financial experts to ensure that his investments were well-informed and diversified across a range of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This strategic approach not only resulted in more stable returns but also mitigated the risks associated with market fluctuations. Lastly, Jason's inability to plan for the future added to his financial woes. He consistently overlooked the need for an emergency fund or a retirement savings plan, leaving him unprepared for unforeseen circumstances or expenses. When faced with unexpected financial setbacks, such as medical bills or job loss, Jason's lack of preparation forced him to deplete his remaining assets and spiral further into debt. Conversely, Joel was acutely aware of the significance of financial planning. He made it a priority to set aside funds for emergencies and continually contributed to a robust retirement savings plan. This foresight allowed him to weather any financial storms that arose, ultimately safeguarding his financial stability over the long term. In summary, Jason got into a deep financial hole, unlike Joel, because he failed to exercise financial prudence, made imprudent investment decisions, and neglected to plan for the future. Joel's responsible money management, careful investing, and thoughtful financial planning not only prevented him from falling into the same trap as Jason but also ensured the steady growth and preservation of their fortunes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Two friends met after 20 years. Tom had been smoking tobacco all these years and had some health problems related to that, while Randy quit smoking 25 years ago.  But I can use this background: Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat?","output":"To answer the question, we can analyze the information given about the two friends and their smoking habits, as well as the general information about the relationship between tobacco smoke and cancer risks. Step 1: Analyzing the friends' smoking habits - Tom had been smoking tobacco all these years. - Randy quit smoking 25 years ago. Step 2: Connecting tobacco smoke to cancer risks - Many different chemical substances cause cancer. - Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer. - Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Step 3: Comparing the cancer risks of the two friends based on their smoking habits - Tom continued smoking for the past 20 years, exposing himself to the chemicals in tobacco smoke, which increases the risk of cancer, including throat cancer. - Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, which means he has not been exposed to the chemicals in tobacco smoke for the past 25 years, leading to a reduced risk of developing cancer, including throat cancer. Conclusion: Based on the given information, Randy, the friend who quit smoking 25 years ago, had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat compared to Tom, who had been smoking tobacco all these years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: How can people get worms in their faces? Second question: How do people get worms? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, I'll answer the two questions separately before discussing if they are asking the same thing. Question 1: How can people get worms in their faces? 1. Identify possible types of worm infections that can affect the face: Some types of worm infections that can affect the human face include cutaneous larva migrans and myiasis. 2. Analyze transmission methods: Cutaneous larva migrans is caused by hookworm larvae that can penetrate the skin, but it's more common in the hands and feet rather than the face. Myiasis is caused by fly larvae that infest living tissue, and this can occur in various parts of the body, including the face. 3. Summarize possible causes: People can get worms in their faces through direct contact with contaminated soil, water, or infected animals (in the case of cutaneous larva migrans), or through exposure to flies that lay eggs on the skin or in wounds (in the case of myiasis). Question 2: How do people get worms? 1. Identify common types of worm infections: Some common types of worm infections in humans include roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and threadworms. 2. Analyze transmission methods: These infections can be contracted in various ways, such as: - Consumption of contaminated food or water, particularly undercooked meat, which can lead to infections like tapeworms and roundworms. - Direct contact with contaminated soil, which can lead to hookworm infections. - Ingesting or inhaling worm eggs (in the case of threadworms), which can be spread through direct contact with an infected person or touching contaminated surfaces. 3. Summarize possible causes: People can get worms through consumption of contaminated food or water, contact with infected animals or humans, or exposure to contaminated soil or surfaces. Now, to address if these two questions are asking the same thing: While both questions discuss the topic of people getting worm infections, they are not asking the same thing. The first question specifically refers to worm infections in the face, while the second question refers to worm infections in general.

The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number. The dog pulled his head back in, then rested his chin on top of the overhead roll-bar, his fur blowing back along his head like the spines of a porcupine. \\"Hello?\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" \\"Dingo!

You must generate a detailed and long answer. before dealing with the main theoretical approaches, we should ask ourselves, why there are so many different (and often competing!) are theories!! Make this proper case.","output":"Before diving into the various theoretical approaches, it is crucial to address the question of why there are so many different, and often competing, theories in existence. The abundance of diverse theories can be attributed to various factors, including the complexity of the studied subject matter, contrasting perspectives and opinions, the evolution of knowledge, and the interdisciplinary nature of many fields. Furthermore, theories provide insight into different aspects or dimensions of complex phenomena and may contribute to the evolution of understanding over time. 1. Complexity of Subject Matter: Many fields of study, such as psychology, economics, and sociology, often grapple with complex and dynamic subject matter, which is constantly evolving and adapting to changes in society and the world at large. As a result, a single theory may not be sufficient to address the diverse range of issues and questions that arise in these areas. This complexity necessitates the development of multiple theories, each of which may focus on specific aspects or dimensions of the subject matter. 2. Contrasting Perspectives and Opinions: Scholars and researchers in various fields often hold differing perspectives on the nature of the phenomena they are investigating. These contrasting opinions result in the development of alternative theories, which may challenge or build upon existing thought. This diversity of ideas fosters critical thinking and debate within the academic community, leading to the refinement and evolution of existing theories. 3. Evolution of Knowledge: As new information, discoveries, and techniques emerge, our understanding of the world and society evolves. This ongoing growth in knowledge can result in shifts in the focus of theoretical approaches or even the development of new theories. It is through this dynamic process that the boundaries of human understanding are constantly being pushed and expanded. 4. Interdisciplinary Nature: Many fields of study are inherently interdisciplinary, drawing from multiple disciplines to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a given phenomenon. This cross-disciplinary approach can result in the introduction of new perspectives and methods, leading to the development of novel theories. Additionally, scholars may borrow or adapt theories from one field and apply them to another, generating unique insights that may not have been possible within the confines of a single discipline. In conclusion, the existence of multiple, sometimes competing, theories can be seen as a reflection of the inherent complexity of the subject matter, the importance of diverse perspectives and opinions, the ongoing evolution of knowledge, and the interdisciplinary nature of many fields. These theories both challenge and complement one another, driving researchers and scholars to push the limits of human understanding and contribute to the growth of knowledge and wisdom in the academic community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.  and the situation: Catherine is throwing her friend a birthday party and is starting to put up decorations. She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon.  Answer the following question: If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The full balloon has a higher pressure.

Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Rick Saccone? Options:  A.

Background: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Context: Namdev's padas are not mere poems, according to Callewaert and Lath. Like other Bhakti movement sants, Namdev composed bhajans, that is songs meant to be sung to music. A Bhajan literally means \\"a thing enjoyed or shared\\". Namdev's songs were composed to be melodious and carry a spiritual message. They built on one among the many ancient Indian traditions for making music and singing. Namdev's bhajans, note Callewaert and Lath, deployed particular species of Raag, used Bhanita (or Chhap, a stamp of the composer's name inside the poem, in his case Nama), applied a Tek (or dhruva, repeated refrain) and a meter than helps harmonise the wording with the musical instrument, all according to Sangita manuals refined from the 8th to 13th centuries.  The musical genre of Namdev's literary works was a form of Prabandha - itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).  Callewaert and Lath state that, \\"each single song of Namdev is a musical and textual unit and this unit is the basis for textual considerations\\". The unit contained Antaras, which are the smallest independent unit within that can be shifted around, dropped or added, without affecting the harmony or meaning, when a bhajan is being sung with music. In Namdev's songs, the dominant pattern is Caturasra, or an avarta with the 4x4 square pattern of musical matras (beat). Question: Who did he teach the Bhajans to?. Whats the answer?","output":"Namdev's bhajans were taught to his disciples and followers, who then transmitted them verbally across generations in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition) within singing gharanas (family-like musical units). The exact names of specific individuals he taught are not mentioned, but his teachings and bhajans were passed down through the generations, thus preserving and spreading his spiritual messages through music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm had milk production which reduced pesticides utilization?  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

The lake's geographic location, cultural significance, and name inspired by Nausicaa, a Greek princess in Homer's \\"Odyssey,\\" do not provide adequate data to ascertain the quality of the tap water. Water clarity is affected by several factors, including the presence of pollutants, sediments, and microorganisms. In order to determine water quality and clarity, different aspects should be assessed and tested, including: 1. Chemical Analysis: A thorough examination of the water's chemical composition, such as its pH level, dissolved oxygen, and the presence of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, would be needed. These factors can impact water clarity, as can the presence of heavy metals and other contaminants. 2. Physical Examination: The water's turbidity, or cloudiness due to suspended particles, should be assessed to gain a better understanding of its clarity. Measuring temperature is also important, as it affects the solubility of substances within the water. 3. Biological Assessment: The presence of microorganisms, such as bacteria or algae, can significantly impact water clarity, since they can cause discoloration and overgrowth in certain environments. Analyzing the population of aquatic species, like fish and plants, can provide insight into the overall health of the water system. 4. Watershed Management: An investigation of the watershed management practices in the area plays a crucial role in the lake's water quality. Surrounding land uses, such as agriculture, urban development, and industrial activities, can all influence contaminant and nutrient levels in a water body. In conclusion, it is impossible to determine the clarity of the tap water from Nausikaa Lake without conducting a comprehensive analysis that takes these aforementioned factors into account."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

American and English Experience of National Debts. Our Abundant Sources of Revenue, and How the Debt May be Paid. AMOUNT OF DEBT AND RATE OF GROWTH The national debt is a matter of increasing concern for many nations. It represents the cumulative balance of all government borrowings over the years that have not yet been repaid. The amount of national debt and its rate of growth vary from country to country, depending on multiple factors such as the government's fiscal policies, economic development levels, and the state of the global economy. As the figures continue to climb, it becomes imperative to evaluate our debt situation, compare it with other nations, and explore viable solutions to manage and eventually eliminate this financial burden. AMERICAN AND BRITISH EXPERIENCE OF NATIONAL DEBT The experience of national debt is not unique to any single country. Historical comparisons between the United States and the United Kingdom provide valuable insight into the trajectory of national debt. In the aftermath of the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, both countries faced significant debts which influenced their respective futures. DIFFERENCE OF CONDITIONS It is essential to acknowledge that while similarities do exist, differences remain in the economic and political conditions between the United States and the United Kingdom. These variations can determine how economies cope with debt, and the ultimate ability to pay. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN RELATION TO RESOURCES When discussing national debt, it is crucial to differentiate between the principal amount and the interest owed on that principal. The principal sum represents the original amount borrowed, while the interest arises from the cost of borrowing. The resources used to service the debt will address the interest, and over time, reduce the principal amount owed. INTEREST ON OUR DEBT The interest on national debt is an essential factor to consider, as it affects the country’s fiscal management. High-interest payments can lead to budgetary strains and reduce the funds available for essential public services and investments. BURDEN OF THE INTEREST UPON OUR RESOURCES The burden of interest on national debt falls on our resources, directly affecting our disposable income, investments, and overall economic growth. PROSPECTIVE RESOURCES While the national debt may seem daunting, abundant prospective resources offer hope. Among these are the mineral regions, which have been a rich source of revenue for countries with sizeable reserves. Additionally, the emergence of petroleum as a commodity also holds significant promise in generating revenue. REVENUE National revenue, consisting of tax receipts and other income sources, plays a key role in meeting interest payments and eventually repaying the debt. A steady and healthy national revenue enables the government to address fiscal challenges more effectively. ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REVENUE - EXPORT DUTIES Exploring additional sources of revenue is crucial to address the national debt effectively. Implementing export duties on specific commodities and goods can generate essential income to be directed towards paying off the debt. REVENUE FROM THE SOUTHERN STATES In the context of the United States, revenue from the southern states could contribute significantly to the effort of eliminating national debt. The restoration of these states would not only generate revenue but also boost overall economic growth. INTEREST OF THE DEBT AND ORDINARY EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS Projecting interest payments and ordinary expenses for upcoming years can help prioritize debt reduction goals while ensuring continued investments in essential services. PAYMENT OF THE DEBT IN TWENTY YEARS FROM 1870 Devising a payment plan can offer guidance and set feasible milestones in eliminating national debt. It is essential to approach the task with a long-term perspective, such as a target of debt clearance set for 20 years from now. RESOURCES OF THE RESTORED UNION - ANNUAL CHARGE REQUIRED FOR EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE DEBT IN TWENTY YEARS The restored union should harness its collective resources to meet the annual financial requirements necessary to extinguish the national debt within the target timeline. BURDEN OF BRITISH TAXATION UPON THE ANNUAL PRODUCT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM Analyzing the burden of taxation in the United Kingdom reveals the impact on the national product. It offers insight into how countries can effectively manage taxation while addressing the vital aspect of national debt. In conclusion, the national debt poses a challenge not only for the present day but also for generations to come. Drawing from historical comparisons and examining current experiences, we must utilize our abundant resources and devise sound strategies to manage and eventually eradicate this fiscal burden. Only through diligent planning and responsible financial stewardship can we hope to secure a more prosperous and stable future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Question: when was the american labor union formed? Would \\"Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"The American Labor Union, also known as the American Federation of Labor (AFL), was formed on December 8, 1886. The AFL was a nationwide alliance of labor organizations that aimed to represent the interests of skilled workers in various trades and industries. The organization played a significant role in promoting workers' rights and was significant in the history of the U.S. labor movement.

The gross value added (GVA) of an economy is a measure of the goods and services produced, taking into account the value of intermediate goods and services used in the production process. It excludes subsidies and taxes on products, and gives a figure that represents the contribution to the economy made by an area, industry or sector. GVA is an important indicator to understand the economic performance of an area, helping policymakers and businesses to make informed decisions. In this specific context, the statement is clearly mentioning that Plymouth's GVA in 2013 was 5,169 million GBP.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\". She has a hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact. Answer:","output":"Dolores Haze"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor PUBLISHED: 15:32 EST, 12 December 2013 | UPDATED: 15:35 EST, 12 December 2013 Congress' top GOP watchdog is warning the secretary of Health and Human Services to stop instructing contractors behind healthcare.gov not to talk to Congress about the project. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair Darrell Issa, a hard-charging California Republican, told Sec. Kathleen Sebelius in a letter on Wednesday that it's against the law to get between Congress and the companies her agency hired to work on  the crash-and-burn website. 'Obstructing a Congressional investigation is a crime,' Issa said Thursday in a statement. obstruction laws reflect the fact that","output":"Congress has a constitutional right to conduct investigations and gather information as part of its oversight responsibilities. These powers enable Congress to ensure the effective functioning of government agencies, protect the public's interest, and maintain checks and balances within the federal government. Obstruction laws exist to ensure that this important function can be carried out without interference or hindrance. In the case mentioned above, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Republican Darrell Issa, was exercising its oversight authority to investigate the healthcare.gov website's development and implementation. Kathleen Sebelius, as Secretary of Health and Human Services, was responsible for the management of the department, which included overseeing the website's development. If contractors working on the project were indeed instructed not to communicate with Congress, this action could potentially hinder the congressional investigation. Obstruction of a congressional investigation is a serious offense under federal law. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1505, anyone who \\"corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due  and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress\\" can be punished with fines and imprisonment of up to five years. Issa's warning to Sebelius is a reminder that obstructing a congressional investigation is not only a breach of trust between the executive and legislative branches, but also a violation of federal law. Upholding the constitutional right to conduct investigations is crucial to guaranteeing government accountability, transparency, and efficiency. As such, it is in the best interest of all parties involved to cooperate fully and transparently with the investigation and to avoid any actions that could be construed as obstruction. In conclusion, obstruction laws serve to protect the constitutional right of Congress to conduct investigations and gather information necessary for the efficient functioning of government agencies and oversight. This is a vital function of the legislative branch in maintaining checks and balances within the federal government and ensuring the public's interest is upheld. Obstructing this process is a serious offense punishable under federal law, and it is the responsibility of all parties involved in a congressional investigation to cooperate fully and transparently to ensure a thorough and effective process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: On 24 March 1992, the number 3 power generating unit at the Leningrad Atomic Power Station in Sosnovyi Bor underwent an emergency shutdown. The plant suffered a steam leak, which spewed a total of some 3 thousand curies into the atmosphere. Sentence: Nuclear Power Plant of Sosnovyi Bor suffers an emergency shut down.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Nuclear Power Plant of Sosnovyi Bor suffers an emergency shutdown\\" is true based on the provided text. On 24 March 1992, the Leningrad Atomic Power Station, located in Sosnovyi Bor, experienced an emergency shutdown involving its number 3 power generating unit. This incident was caused by a steam leak, which released approximately 3 thousand curies of radioactive material into the atmosphere. An emergency shutdown, also known as a scram, is a rapid shutdown of a nuclear reactor to ensure that it ceases criticality and safely cools down. This procedure is implemented in response to potential safety issues or unexpected events, such as equipment failures, which can endanger the reactor's integrity. The Leningrad Atomic Power Station, or Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant, is a Russian nuclear power facility situated close to the city of St. Petersburg. This plant is historically significant as the first nuclear power plant in the world to use RBMK-type reactors, which are water-cooled, graphite-moderated channel reactors. At the time of the incident, the power station contained four such RBMK-1000 reactors, each generating a capacity of 1000 MWe. The emergency shutdown at the Leningrad Atomic Power Station raised concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants, particularly because it occurred only six years after the catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. This event had led to the release of a large amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere and significant environmental and health impacts. While the incident at the Leningrad Atomic Power Station was not as severe as the Chernobyl disaster, it still demonstrated the potential risks associated with nuclear power generation and the importance of adopting robust safety measures to safeguard employees, the public, and the environment from harm. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Nuclear Power Plant of Sosnovyi Bor suffers an emergency shutdown\\" accurately reflects the events that transpired on 24 March 1992 at the Leningrad Atomic Power Station in Sosnovyi Bor. These events resulted in the shutdown of the number 3 power generating unit and the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere due to a steam leak."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What musical based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film \\"8½\\" did Mary Stuart Masterson star in? Answer:","output":"The musical based on Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film \\"8½\\" in which Mary Stuart Masterson starred is \\"Nine.\\" \\"Nine\\" is a Broadway musical that was created and composed by Maury Yeston, with Arthur Kopit handling the adaptation for the stage. The musical originally premiered on Broadway in 1982 and has been revived and performed multiple times since its inception. The story centers around the character Guido Contini, an Italian film director who is dealing with a creative and personal crisis as he approaches his 40th birthday. The plot is inspired by Fellini's \\"8½,\\" and it explores Contini's relationships with various women in his life, including his wife, his lover, his muse, and his mother. The show's title derives from the fact that Contini is 40, and if you drop the zero, you're left with the number 9, which serves as a symbol for a new beginning. In 2003, a Broadway revival of \\"Nine\\" was brought to life by David Leveaux as the director. Antonio Banderas portrayed Guido Contini, while Mary Stuart Masterson played his wife, Luisa. It was during this revival that Masterson appeared in the role, earning a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance. The revival itself was successful, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical and receiving multiple other nominations. \\"Nine\\" has been lauded for its unique story, fantastic performances, and evocative music that brilliantly contrasts humor and emotion.

Can we infer the following? saudi arabia will shift to a 60% proportion of lighter crudes Pick your answer from: * Yes. * It's impossible to say. * No. The answer is:","output":"It's impossible to say.  While it is evident that Saudi Arabia's production mix will shift to a higher proportion of lighter crudes, there is not enough information provided to confirm that it will specifically reach a 60% proportion. The shift in production mix could be lower or higher than 60%. Factors such as the demand for lighter crudes, global market dynamics, and the success of the proposed projects can influence the extent of this shift. Additionally, future developments and technological advancements might allow for even more flexibility in Saudi Arabia's production mix. Furthermore, some other factors that can impact Saudi Arabia's decision to shift its production mix to a higher percentage of lighter crudes include: 1. Market dynamics: Changes in global oil demand and supply, as well as fluctuations in crude oil prices, can play a significant role in determining the extent to which Saudi Arabia shifts its production mix. The ability to adapt to these market changes will be crucial. 2. Technological advancements: The development of new extraction technologies and the optimization of existing infrastructure can help Saudi Arabia diversify its production mix even further. Technological advancements can enhance the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact of oil production, thus affecting the proportion of lighter crudes in the overall mix. 3. Investment opportunities: As Saudi Arabia continues to invest in its oil sector, it will need to choose which projects and oil fields will ensure the highest returns. This can influence the degree to which the country's production mix shifts towards lighter crudes. 4. Geopolitical considerations: Saudi Arabia's role as the world's largest oil producer and its membership in OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, means that its production decisions can have global implications. Political factors within and outside the country, including international relations, might affect the proportion of lighter crudes in Saudi Arabia's production mix. 5. Environmental factors: The growing focus on environmental sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lead to increased demand for lighter crude oils, which generally produce fewer harmful pollutants. This could fuel Saudi Arabia's decision to increase the production of lighter crudes.

Having an \\"excellent cast\\" often means that the actors were successful in convincing the audience of their roles and generating emotional responses. 3. \\"Overcome the obstacles\\" — The use of the term \\"overcome\\" suggests that the movie had some shortcomings or challenges that needed to be surmounted. In this case, the obstacles are a \\"predictable outcome\\" and a \\"screenplay that glosses over Rafael's evolution.\\" 4. \\"Predictable outcome\\" — This remark implies that the movie's plot was relatively easy to anticipate. The reviewer believes that the storyline may not have been particularly original or inventive, which may have made the movie less engaging for some viewers. 5. \\"Screenplay that glosses over Rafael's evolution\\" — The reviewer seems to be disappointed with the way the movie's script handles the development of the character named Rafael. The criticism indicates that the character's growth or change throughout the movie was not explored in-depth or given the attention it deserved. To summarize: The movie review presents positive elements, such as the director's competent direction and the excellent cast, that seem to outweigh the mentioned negatives about the predictable outcome and the less detailed depiction of character development. Consequently, based on the preceding review, one can infer that the movie was seen more positively than negatively by the reviewer. However, it is important to remember that this is only the opinion of one reviewer, and not necessarily the consensus among all viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... Question: Why was the author aware of their positionality? Options: - because they were doing research on research evaluation   - not enough information   - because they were a junior researcher   - because they were British === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"because they were a junior researcher"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Who is Bulldust the father of? is inside the article: A paleontologist named Zack takes his nephew Ricky and niece Jade on a fossil hunt. While alone, Ricky is met by a talking raven, who turns into an Alexornis named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of Edmontosaurus to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler., can you guess it ?","output":"Bulldust is the father of Patchi and Scowler, two Pachyrhinosaurus siblings in the story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago.

There are two general types of begonias: those grown from seeds, and those grown from tubers/bulbs. The seed-started begonias tend to be a bit smaller and difficult to grow, while bulb begonias are sturdier and larger plants.","output":"Before planting, research the specific begonia variety of your choice and gather required materials.  Begonias are diverse in their appearances, growing habits, and care requirements, with thousands of different cultivars available. Some of the most popular varieties include wax begonias, angel wing begonias, and tuberous begonias. Once you have identified your preferred type, gather all necessary supplies, such as pots or garden beds, soil, fertilizer, gardening tools, and the seeds, tubers, or young plants themselves, depending on your chosen variety. Prepare the planting site or container. If planting begonias directly in your garden, choose a site with well-draining soil and partial shade, as begonias prefer indirect sunlight. In contrast, if you prefer growing begonias in containers, large pots with drainage holes work best. For both methods, use a well-draining, fertile soil rich in organic matter, and maintain a slightly acidic pH of 6.0 to 6.5. Plant your begonias at the appropriate time. If starting begonias from seeds or tubers, begin indoors during the late winter months to give the plants a head start before spring arrives. Seeds should be planted shallowly, about ⅛ inch deep, while tubers should be positioned slightly below the soil surface with the indented, concave side facing upwards. When transplanting established begonia plants or seedlings outdoors, wait until the threat of frost has passed, typically in late spring or early summer. Ensure proper watering and fertilization. Begonias require consistent moisture to thrive and should never be allowed to dry out completely. However, avoid overwatering your plants, as this can lead to root rot. To prevent water stress, employ a drip or soaker hose to provide consistent moisture or water container-grown plants when the top inch of soil feels dry. Additionally, supplement your begonias with slow-release, balanced fertilizer during the growing season, complying with recommended frequency and application rates for your specific variety. Monitor for pests and diseases. Although begonias are relatively hardy, they can still fall victim to common pests such as aphids, spider mites, and mealybugs. Pay attention to the health of your plants by frequently inspecting the foliage for pests or disease symptoms. Employ organic pest control methods or chemical pesticides if necessary but follow application instructions carefully to minimize harm to the plants. Provide proper care for overwintering. Certain begonia varieties are perennial and can survive winter dormancy if properly cared for. For instance, when dealing with tuberous begonias, the tubers should be removed from the ground or containers, cleared of excess soil, and stored in a cool, dry location until spring. Alternatively, some varieties, like the angel wing or rex begonias, can be brought indoors and grown as houseplants during the winter months. With diligent care and attention, your begonias will flourish throughout the growing season, showcasing their showy blooms and stunning foliage. Regularly assess the plants' needs, and adjust your care techniques accordingly to ensure their optimal health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When I discovered that my sick relative was allergic to the plant, I decided it would be best for us to remove the plant from his proximity, and instead, place more emphasis on the card I had sent. The card contained heartfelt words, offering genuine support and empathy during his time of illness. It was meant to bring a sense of comfort and solace even in his darkest moments, making him feel less alone on his path to recovery. The beautifully designed card featured an uplifting handwritten message, filling every inch with positivity and love. Upon reading it, he slowly felt the tinge of a smile forming across his face despite the upsetting situation he was experiencing. The message expressed my understanding of the struggles he was going through and the desire to support him as much as possible throughout his healing journey. Despite the unfortunate outcome with the plant, the gesture of sending the card turned out to be incredibly impactful, as it showed my relative the depths of my love and concern for him. In moments like these, it is incredibly important to offer our loved ones support and understanding, and sometimes, a simple yet thoughtful card can do just that. This entire experience taught me that our intentions and actions have the power to transcend any unfortunate circumstance that life throws our way.

This also proved that in times of uncertainty or despair, it is our ability to stay connected to one another, through compassion and empathy, that ultimately guides us through our darkest hours.

My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... Question: What is the author's likely opinion on school?

Question: How many countries total were included in the Treaty? Passage:The garden already existed at least in the early 18th century. During the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717-39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade, including the Great military hospital. Based on the Austrian plans, the hospital was set outside of the Belgrade Fortress (\\"Danubian\\" or \\"German Belgrade\\"), in the Serbian part of the city. As shown on the map of Belgrade by Nicolas François de Spar, the Tsarigrad Road began at the Württemberg Gate (Stambol Gate), at the modern Republic Square, and headed towards \\"Marko's cemetery\\" in Tašmajdan. The hospital was situated on the road's right side, where the modern Stari Dvor is located. Behind the hospital there was a large garden, predecessor of the modern park, and further behind it, across the road was the military cemetery. Later \\"Marko's market\\" developed on the spot and today it is the area surrounding the House of the National Assembly of Serbia. After Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739, the northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian buildings it has constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls, including the Great military hospital, which, albeit as a ruin, survived until the next Austrian occupation in 1788.  Links: a. Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39) b. Treaty of Belgrade c. Belgrade Fortress d. Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)","output":"To answer the task, follow these simple steps: 1.

Problem:Passage: The fortifications of Mdina  are a series of defensive walls which surround the former capital city of Mdina, Malta. The city was founded as Maleth by the Phoenicians in around the 8th century BC, and it later became part of the Roman Empire under the name Melite. The ancient city was surrounded by walls, but very few remains of these have survived. The city walls were rebuilt a number of times, including by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century AD, the Arabs in around the 11th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily in the medieval period until the 15th century. Most of the extant fortifications were built by the Order of Saint John between the 16th and 18th centuries. The city has withstood a number of sieges, and it was defeated twice - first by the Aghlabids in 870 and then by Maltese rebels in 1798. Today, the city walls are still intact except for some outworks, and they are among the best preserved fortifications in Malta. Mdina has been on Malta's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998. Question: When was the second time the city of Melite was defeated? Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the context of the question. Usage: The question asks for the second time the city of Melite was defeated. We are looking for an event that occurred after the city experienced its first defeat. Example: \\"it was defeated twice - first by the Aghlabids in 870 and then by Maltese rebels in 1798.\\" This meets the criteria because it provides information about the second defeat of the city. Part #2: Identifying the type of answer needed. Usage: We need to determine whether the answer should be labeled as \\"span,\\" \\"number,\\" or \\"date.\\" Since the question is asking for a specific time, we need an answer type that reflects that. Example: \\"date.\\" This meets the criteria because the answer provided (1798) is a specific point in time. Part #3: Providing the correct answer. Usage: Now that we've determined the type of answer needed, we can provide the correct information from the passage. Example: \\"1798\\" This meets the criteria because it is the second time the city was defeated, as mentioned in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: The War of the Limburg Succession, was a series of conflicts between 1283 and 1289 for the succession in the Duchy of Limburg. The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant. The City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of an Imperial city in 1475. How many years did the conflicts and confrontations overlap?","output":"The conflicts and confrontations of the War of the Limburg Succession happened between 1283 and 1289. So, they overlapped for about 6 years. Remember, this was a long, long time ago when people were fighting over who should be in charge of a place called the Duchy of Limburg. Just like how sometimes kids argue about who gets to be the leader, these grown-ups had a big disagreement and fought for 6 years to figure it out."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question What might I do in order to prevent developing Carpel Tunnel ? Answer:","output":"In order to prevent developing Carpal Tunnel, you might want to take the following steps: Step 1: Maintain proper ergonomics at your workstation Ensure that your workstation is set up ergonomically, with your monitor at eye level, keyboard and mouse positioned to allow for a neutral wrist position, and your chair adjusted to maintain good posture. This can help reduce strain on the wrists and hands. Step 2: Take breaks and stretch Take regular breaks throughout your workday, ideally every 30-60 minutes. During these breaks, perform stretching exercises for your wrists, hands, and fingers. This will help to increase blood flow and keep the muscles and tendons flexible. Step 3: Maintain a relaxed grip Use a light touch when typing and handling the mouse. A relaxed grip can help to reduce muscle strain and prevent excessive pressure on the median nerve. Step 4: Consider using ergonomic equipment Invest in ergonomic accessories such as a wrist rest, an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, or a split keyboard. These tools are designed to help maintain proper wrist alignment and reduce pressure on the median nerve. Step 5: Strengthen hand and wrist muscles Perform exercises targeted at strengthening the muscles of the wrists and hands. This will help to provide better support and stability, reducing the stress on the median nerve. Step 6: Practice good posture Maintain good posture while working at your computer, keeping your shoulders back and down, and your neck aligned with your spine. Poor posture can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome by causing muscle imbalances and compressing the nerves in the neck and shoulders.

Pick from: -Add the eggs to the butter and sugar and stir them in until they're blended. Stir in the vanilla until it is completely incorporated into the batter.; -Crack 3 ripe strawberries into the mix and cream until the strawberries form a batter. Add the vanilla essence, oil, and milk and beat in until thoroughly blended.; -Add the extracts, milk and cold water in the bowl and mix until they're fully incorporated. Add the cream and the water and mix everything together.; -Transfer the mixture to an 8 by 9-inch (20 by 22-centimeter) baking dish and sprinkle the remaining flour onto it. Place the prepared cookies onto the baking pan.; Answer:","output":"-Add the eggs to the butter and sugar and stir them in until they're blended. Stir in the vanilla until it is completely incorporated into the batter. Next, in a separate large bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until a cohesive dough forms. Gently fold in the chocolate chips with a spatula, ensuring that they're evenly distributed throughout the dough. Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, portion the dough into equal-sized balls and place them onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches (5 centimeters) of space between each cookie. Gently press down on the dough balls to flatten them slightly. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned and the centers are set but still slightly soft. Make sure to keep an eye on them to prevent overbaking, as this can lead to a less chewy cookie. Once the cookies are done baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies rest on the sheet for about 5 minutes to firm up a bit. Afterward, use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack to let them cool completely. Enjoy your chewy chocolate chip oatmeal cookies with a cold glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage. These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week, or you can freeze them for up to three months for longer-lasting enjoyment. Simply let them thaw at room temperature for a few hours before indulging in their deliciousness once again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fidel and Raul Castro.  (3). The Soviet Union.  (4). not enough information. Q: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

Flight data had suggested his plane was heading to East Asia but that it instead went to Dubai. Mr Mugabe said he had gone there for a family matter. In May, Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, said that he would rule from the grave. The flight path and other rumours had led some to speculate that Mr Mugabe had suffered a serious health problem and had sought treatment in Dubai or had even succumbed to his illness. The Southern Daily website had posted an article headlined \\"Robert Mugabe suffers stroke, Mnangagwa now the new interim President of Zimbabwe\\". Emmerson Mnangagwa is the country's vice-president. But Reuters news agency said that on arriving at Harare Mr Mugabe had told reporters in the local Shona language: \\"I had gone on a family matter to Dubai concerning one of my children. \\"Yes, I was dead, it's true I was dead.

Article: There are many differences between America and China. The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas  , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid   people. 4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. And only after passengers have passed the road and got the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient, safe and humanizing. Question: Why is there a middle lane of turning left on the road? - It is designed for the cars that want to turn left. - It is very safe to drive there. - It is very convenient for the traffic police to find the cars that break the rules. - The cars that want to turn left can easily give a signal of turning left. A:","output":"The middle lane of turning left on the road is designed for the cars that want to turn left. This lane allows the cars to enter and give a signal of turning left when they think it is safe to do so, helping to maintain the flow of traffic and contributing to safer driving conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. contains an answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I?, what is it ?

The question asks to identify unique features that characterize majuscules (uppercase letters), as opposed to minuscules (lowercase letters). The sentence provided discusses the variation in the height of minuscules due to ascenders and descenders, but it does not mention any unique features of majuscules that distinguish them from minuscules. Majuscules and minuscules mainly differ in size, form, and usage. For example, majuscules are larger capital letters, often occupying the same height, whereas minuscules are smaller lowercase letters with a combination of shorter base height, ascenders, and descenders. Majuscules are typically used at the beginning of a sentence, for proper nouns, or for emphasis, while minuscules are used for the majority of the text, including common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech. Beyond these general differences, specific letterforms of majuscules and minuscules may vary in shape and style. In some typefaces, the uppercase and lowercase versions of a letter might have different design nuances. For instance, in serif typefaces, a majuscule may possess more pronounced or elaborate serifs compared to its minuscule counterpart.

Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations.  Which group studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, was the group that studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation.  As mentioned in the hint, somatic mutations occur in the body cells and are not passed down to offspring. These mutations can arise during an organism's lifetime due to various factors, such as exposure to radiation or chemicals. They can affect the cells' functions and might even lead to diseases like cancer. However, since somatic mutations are not present in the organism's sex cells or gametes, they are not inherited by the next generation. In contrast, group A focused on germline mutations, which occur in the DNA of sex cells. Germline mutations are of particular concern, as they can be passed on to the offspring, making them inheritable. These mutations, if present in the zygote, will be present in every cell of the resulting organism. Germline mutations can cause hereditary diseases or disorders in the next generation, significantly impacting their development and overall health. While both germline and somatic mutations are important in understanding the dynamics of genetic mutations, group B's focus on somatic mutations provided more insight into the type of mutations that cannot be passed down to the next generation. These studies help in understanding the development and progression of various diseases and disorders arising due to somatic mutations and can aid in developing potential therapeutic approaches to combat their consequences."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Summarize: The film is set against the real-life backdrop of the Holodomor - when millions of Ukrainians were starved to death in the early 1930s as Soviet leader Joseph Stalin stripped them of their produce to force farmers into collectivisation. Bitter Harvest follows two lovers, artist Yuri (Max Irons) and his childhood sweetheart Natalka (Samantha Barks), who are separated in the struggle against Soviet oppression before Yuri attempts a dangerous journey back home. Tamer Hassan, who's played Khal Forzo in Game of Thrones and starred opposite Danny Dyer in The Football Factory, plays Russian soldier Sergei, intent on destroying a swathe of Ukrainian villages. We asked the film's stars what they took away from the experience. The actors had no knowledge of the Holodomor before joining the film - and they're not alone. Tamer: \\"I'm probably one of the 95% of the world not knowing about the Holodomor - which translated means 'death by starvation'\\". Samantha: \\"The fact the Holodomor wasn't something I knew about - the reason I didn't know about this and so many people don't is because it was kept under wraps until 1991 (when the Soviet Union collapsed). It's completely shocking.\\" Max: \\"Stalin's closing of the Ukrainian border was so effective, nobody knew.\\" Tamer, best known for playing villains such as the head of Millwall's hooligan firm in The Football Factory, had his work cut out playing Stalin's Russian enforcer Sergei. Tamer: \\"Every movie needs a villain and he's definitely the worst I've ever played. \\"He's the antichrist, he's a cold-blooded mass murderer, he's a paedophile. \\"You want to know why he's doing what he's doing, none of us are born evil. He witnessed his mother being murdered in a church. There's a little bit (in me) that wanted the audience to feel sorry for him or love him, even for a millisecond.\\" The movie was a labour of love for the Ukrainian filmmakers. Tamer: \\"It's still happening today, history repeating itself. Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore, the movie industry is no different to real estate.  But for Ian Ihnatowycz, the lead producer, and director George Mandeluk, who are Ukrainians whose families suffered in the Holodomor, they're very passionate about putting this story out. It's a gift to their people. \\"We were very lucky to be able to film in Ukraine at the historical sites where it all happened. We had an amazing Ukrainian cast and crew. You feel it when you're there. There was a lot of goodwill behind the movie.\\" Note to self - never stand behind a horse. Tamer: \\"We were using circus horses, not stunt horses, they were working these horses to the bone. \\"I don't blame the horse, we became friends! But I walked behind the horse. It stamped on my foot and kicked back and severed my cartilage. The X-ray was a horseshoe print on my foot! \\"I went to the hospital, the consultant said: 'We'll have to put it in plaster, operate and you'll have to have six weeks off.  I said: 'I'm an actor, we don't have those luxuries!' So I went back to set, put my boot on and within two or three hours my foot would swell out, I was in excruciating pain and trying to act at the same time. They had to cut me out of the boot. So anyone who wants to be an actor, don't, it's not that glamorous and it's painful!\\" It's all about the love. Max: \\"What drew me to it was the love story - two people struggling with their reality. People are suspicious of love stories in films if they appear manufactured but this one is beautiful. When we hear testimony from the people who survived, love is the driving force in their quest for survival. That's what you see with Yuri and Natalka. Love that pushed them to endure that cold a little bit more, to walk that little bit further.\\" Feeling the weight of responsibility. Samantha: \\"You want to be as truthful and honour that story as much of you can but obviously that's a pressure because it's a huge, huge part of history that's been kept under wraps for so long.\\" Max: \\"Ukraine's relationship with Russia is difficult, safe to say for hundreds of years there's been a very determined effort to dilute Ukrainian national identity and we see that again today. The more voices the Ukraine can have the better.\\" And finally - Max, what's it like having Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack as your mum and dad? Max: \\"We don't talk about acting that much thank God because that would be horrible! They didn't try to put me off, the advice they gave me most was there will be good days and there will be bad days. That's an actor's life and prepare yourself emotionally, financially, spiritually for that. But then when they saw I was serious about it, they let me get on with it.\\" Bitter Harvest is released in UK cinemas on 24 February.","output":"\\"Bitter Harvest\\" is a film set during the Holodomor, a real-life event in which millions of Ukrainians starved to death in the early 1930s. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin caused the catastrophe as part of his efforts to force collectivization. The movie chronicles the story of two lovers, Yuri and Natalka, who are separated due to the struggle against Soviet oppression. The actors had no knowledge of the Holodomor before joining the project, which serves to highlight this tragic, yet relatively unknown event. Filming took place in Ukraine at historical sites where the events occurred, making it a significant project for the Ukrainian filmmakers involved. The love story at the core of the film showcases how love was the driving force in many people's quest for survival during this horrific time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat  Explain why a human would choose \\"will not starve\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Will not starve.\\" A human would choose \\"will not starve\\" as the answer to the question above because it best encapsulates the primary objective for a poor person when seeking food. In order to understand why this is, it is important to first assess each of the given options and their significance in relation to a poor person's situation. 1. Digesting: While the process of digestion is necessary for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, it is a basic physiological function that applies to all individuals, irrespective of their socio-economic status. Therefore, it does not specifically address the goal of a poor person having food.  2. Being full: Although feeling full might provide a temporary sense of satisfaction, it does not necessarily imply long-term relief from hunger or starvation. A poor person might be full for a short while, but if they consistently lack the means to acquire food, this sensation would be fleeting and their overall nutritional needs would remain unaddressed.  3. Will not starve: This option is the most accurate in describing the goal of a poor person having food. For those living in poverty and experiencing food scarcity, the primary focus is on obtaining enough sustenance to avoid starvation. People in this situation are typically not concerned with luxury or indulgence; rather, their immediate challenge is to survive and not succumb to life-threatening hunger. 4. Survive: Although survival is undoubtedly a key goal for a poor person, it is a more general and overarching objective. Survival encompasses not just access to food but also other essential resources such as shelter, water, and healthcare. While \\"survive\\" touches upon the importance of food, it does not directly and specifically highlight the issue of starvation that poor individuals often face. 5. Getting fat: This option is not relevant to the goal of a poor person having food. For those living in poverty, the focus is usually on overcoming hunger and malnutrition, rather than gaining weight or amassing body fat. In fact, poor people often face higher rates of malnutrition, which can lead to underweight and stunted growth. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"will not starve\\" as the answer to the question because it clearly articulates the most pressing concern for a poor person seeking food. This answer signifies the critical need to avoid life-threatening hunger and to overcome the struggles of food scarcity that are commonly associated with poverty. By selecting this response, a human recognizes the urgency and importance of addressing hunger and malnutrition, and acknowledges the fundamental right of all individuals to have access to adequate nutrition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"? from the following article ?  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter).

Q: Passage: Mark first appears in season two, introduced as a highly respected otolaryngologist sub-specialized in plastic surgery and the childhood best friend of neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). In his first appearance, he flirts with Meredith Grey, and Derek punches him in the face. Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife, Addison (Kate Walsh) while they were living in New York. Mark travels to Seattle, intent on convincing Addison to return with him to New York, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship. Mark returns during season three at Addison's drunken behest, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred, Mark sells his successful private practice (which he previously shared with Derek) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During Meredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek's friendship back. It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek's sisters. Mark has a brief fling with Addison's friend, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and develops a friendship with Derek's girlfriend, intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). It is revealed that after Derek left New York, Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months, during which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time, Addison will give their relationship another chance. Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

This choice provides a clearer and more accurate method of capturing the desired image using the built-in camera app on an iPhone.  Here's a detailed breakdown of the entire process of taking a picture on an iPhone: 1. First and foremost, locate the Camera app icon on your iPhone. The icon usually displays a camera graphic and can be found either on the Home screen or in the App Library. If you have difficulty finding it, swipe downward on the Home screen to access the search bar, type in \\"Camera,\\" and tap on the Camera app icon that appears in the search results. 2. Once the Camera app is open, you will see a live preview of what your iPhone camera is viewing. At this stage, make sure that the mode is set to \\"Photo,\\" which should be highlighted in yellow. If not, swipe left or right at the bottom of the screen to switch between camera modes. As desired, tap on the screen to adjust focus and exposure settings based on your subject. 3. Carefully compose your shot by ensuring that the subject is within the frame and properly positioned. Make any necessary adjustments, such as altering the angle, distance, or lighting, to achieve the desired composition. 4. When you are ready to capture the photo, locate the white-rimmed circle, which is the shutter button, at the center of the bottom of the screen. Press this button to take the picture. The iPhone will automatically save the captured image to the Photos app. 5. Optionally, you can also use the Volume Up button on the side of the iPhone to act as a shutter button if it is more convenient. Choosing the second option—going to the camera app and tapping on the frame of the picture you want to take—may confuse the camera app since tapping on the screen primarily adjusts focus and exposure settings. This action might not necessarily take a photograph, which could result in missing the opportunity to capture the desired image. In conclusion, the most sensible choice for taking a picture using the iPhone camera is to go to the camera app and click on the white-rimmed circle in the middle of the bottom of the page. This method ensures that you have complete control over capturing the image, composing your shot, and utilizing the iPhone's built-in camera features effectively."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Specifically, option A (No) would be inaccurate because the question is asking for detailed information about the cast member(s) leaving the show, not a confirmation or rejection of a game concept.  Instead, a more appropriate response could be something like this: The question of who is leaving the show \\"Criminal Minds\\" refers to the various cast changes that have occurred throughout the series' run. The show aired from 2005 to 2020, and during that time, several notable actors have left the cast. Mandy Patinkin, who played Jason Gideon, left after the second season. Thomas Gibson, who portrayed Aaron Hotchner, was dismissed from the series during its twelfth season. Shemar Moore, who played Derek Morgan, left after the eleventh season but returned for guest appearances.  Additionally, Jennifer Love Hewitt, who had a starring role as Kate Callahan, left the show after season 10, and Damon Gupton, who portrayed Stephen Walker, left after only one season. Paget Brewster, who played Emily Prentiss, also left the series after season seven but later returned as a series regular in season twelve. The context provided in the question, \\"The game would require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries,\\" seems to describe a potential gameplay concept that could be inspired by the show \\"Criminal Minds.\\" While this concept would likely appeal to fans of the series, it doesn't accurately answer the given question about which cast members are leaving the show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,...

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions.

When Tom and the major arrived at Waterloo Station, the latter in the breathless condition described in a preceding chapter, they found the German waiting for them with his two fellow-exiles. The gentleman of Nihilistic proclivities was somewhat tall and thin, with a long frock-coat buttoned almost up to his throat, which showed signs of giving at the seams every here and there. His grizzly hair fell over his collar behind, and he had a short bristling beard. He stood with one hand stuck into the front of his coat and the other upon his hip, as though rehearsing the position in which his statue might be some day erected in the streets of his native Russia, when the people had their own, and despotism was no more. In spite of his worn attire there was something noble and striking about the man. His bow, when Baumser introduced him to the major and Tom, would have graced any Court in Europe. Round his neck he had a coarse string from which hung a pair of double eye-glasses. These he fixed upon his aquiline nose, and took a good look at the gentlemen whom he had come to serve.  Bulow, of Kiel, was a small, dark-eyed, clean-shaven fellow, quick and energetic in his movements, having more the appearance of a Celt than of a Teuton. He seemed to be full of amiability, and assured the major in execrable English how very happy he was to be able to do a service to one who had shown kindness to their esteemed colleague and persecuted patriot, Von Baumser. Indeed both of the men showed great deference to the German, and the major began to perceive that his friend was a very exalted individual in Socialistic circles.

Article: Many of the world's pollution problems have been caused by the crowding of large groups of people into the cities. Supply for the needs of the people leads to further pollution by industry. If the rapid increase of world population in countries continues at the present rate, there may be much greater harm to human beings. Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as \\"population pollution.\\" About 2,000 years ago, the world population was probably about 250 million. It reached a billion in 1850. By 1930 the population was two billion. It is now three and a half billion. It is expected to double by the year 2,000. If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now. Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up. Now many people believe that man's greatest problem is how to control the growth of the population.

Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Context: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house.

Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage.

Question: suppose there is more rain happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less If there is more rain than usual, it can have both positive and negative effects on vegetable growth, potentially leading to fewer vegetables produced. Here's an in-depth explanation: 1. Overwatering: While plants need water to grow and thrive, excessive rainfall can lead to overwatering. Most plants have specific water requirements, and too much can cause root rot, fungal growth, and oxygen deficiency in the root zone, which can retard plant growth and reduce the number of vegetables produced. Moreover, too much rain can wash away essential nutrients from the soil, depriving plants of the nutrition they need to grow properly. 2. Increased pest and disease pressure: Excess moisture from heavy rainfall creates the perfect environment for various pests and diseases to thrive, including fungi that cause diseases such as blight, mildew, and rot. Pests such as slugs and snails are also more active during rainy periods, and they can cause significant damage to plants, including eating leaves, stems, and flowers. This can decrease the plant's ability to produce vegetables or lead to diseased, inedible produce. 3. Poor pollination: Many vegetable plants depend on insects, particularly bees, for pollination. Excessive rain can limit the ability of these pollinators to visit plants, resulting in reduced pollination and a smaller yield of vegetables. Additionally, continuous rainfall can wash away pollen before it has a chance to fertilize the flowers, further decreasing the chances of successful pollination. 4. Soil erosion and compaction: Heavy rainfall can cause soil erosion, resulting in the loss of valuable topsoil rich in nutrients and organic matter. This not only affects the current crop but can lead to long-term damage to soil health. Furthermore, excess rain can lead to soil compaction, making it difficult for plant roots to penetrate the soil and access nutrients and water, thus negatively impacting vegetable production. 5. Reduced sunlight: More rainfall often equates to more cloud cover, reducing the amount of sunlight plants receive. Since sunlight plays an essential role in photosynthesis, an extended period of cloudy weather can result in slower plant growth, fewer flowers, and ultimately less vegetable production. Given these potential challenges that excessive rain can cause, it is plausible that more rain can lead to less vegetable production in a garden or farm. However, the specific impact will depend on the type of plants, the severity of the rainfall, and the mitigation strategies employed by the gardener or farmer to minimize these risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'.

He left a note for William explaining everything. He built the pipe bomb to get back at the government. When William's friend Oliver died he took his name the next day to hide his past.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gabriel Omar Batistuta (Spanish pronunciation: [ga'brjel o'mar batis'tuta]; born 1 February 1969), nicknamed Batigol [bati'gol] as well as El Angel Gabriel [el ,aNGxel ga'brjel] (Spanish for Angel Gabriel), is a retired Argentine professional footballer. After beginning his career in Argentina in 1988, where he won titles playing for Newell's Old Boys, River Plate, and subsequently Boca Juniors, the prolific striker played most of his club football with Fiorentina in Italy; he is the twelfth-highest scorer of all-time in the Italian Serie A, with 184 goals in 318 matches. When his club Fiorentina was relegated to Serie B in 1993, Batistuta stayed with the club and helped it return to the top-flight league a year later. In 1991, Batistuta was selected to play for Argentina in the Copa America held in Chile, where he finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals as Argentina romped to victory. The following year, he won the FIFA Confederations Cup with Argentina, finishing as the tournament's top-scorer. In 1993, Batistuta played in his second Copa America, this time held in Ecuador, which Argentina won with Batistuta scoring both goals in a 2-1 win over Mexico in the final.  The 1994 World Cup, held in the United States, was a disappointment. After a promising start Argentina were beaten by Romania in the last 16. The morale of the team was seriously affected by Diego Maradona's doping suspension. Despite the disappointing Argentine exit, Batistuta scored four goals in as many games, including a hat-trick in their opening game against Greece.  During the qualification matches for the 1998 World Cup (with former River Plate manager Daniel Passarella) Batistuta was left out of the majority of the games after falling out with the coach over team rules. The two eventually put the dispute aside and Batistuta was recalled for the tournament. In the game against Jamaica, he recorded the second hat-trick of his World Cup career, becoming the fourth player to achieve this (the others were Sandor Kocsis, Just Fontaine, and Gerd Muller) and the first to score a hat-trick in two World Cups. Argentina were knocked out of the World Cup by the Netherlands courtesy of a last minute Dennis Bergkamp winner after the two sides had held out for a 1-1 draw for almost the entire match.  After a good series of performances by Argentina in the qualification matches for the 2002 World Cup, hopes were high that the South Americans - now managed by Marcelo Bielsa - could win the trophy, and Batistuta announced that he planned to quit the national team at the end of the tournament, which Argentina aimed to win. But Argentina's \\"group of death\\" saw the team fall at the first hurdle, only managing a victory against Nigeria (Batistuta scored the match's only goal). They later fell to England 1-0 and managed a mere 1-1 tie against Sweden. This meant that the team was knocked out in the opening round for the first time since 1962. Where did he start outside of his home country?","output":"Gabriel Omar Batistuta, the retired Argentine professional footballer, started playing outside of his home country in Italy.

Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn’t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures. It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway). DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I’d do to be honest – an inexperienced driver at best I’ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) – but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. Q: Sentence: The company has developed an entirely {{ new }} category of products .

The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \\"lingua franca\\". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.  - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .  - Karl Julius Ploetz ( 8 July 1819 -- 6 February 1881 ) was a German author of scholarly works , most notably his Epitome of History published in the English language in 1883 . Ploetz was born in Berlin . He is credited with the idea of arranging historic data by dates , geographic location , and other factors . As later used in the English language , Encyclopedia of World History credited with being one of the most complete and comprehensive academic tools available before the electronic revolution . His work was a compilation of factual world events designed to help the students and the general reader . The first English translation was in the U.S. in 1883 by William H. Tillinghast and published by Houghton Mifflin Company . The name of the original work ( in a form of a handbook ) was Auszug aus der alten , mittleren und neueren Geschichte . Karl Ploetz died in Görlitz in 1881 .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.  - Frisia or Friesland is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea in what today is mostly a large part of the Netherlands, including modern Friesland, and smaller parts of Germany. Frisia is the traditional homeland of the Frisians, a Germanic people that speaks Frisian languages, which together with English form the Anglo-Frisian language group.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - The Frisian languages are a closely related group of Germanic languages, spoken by about 500,000 Frisian people, who live on the southern fringes of the North Sea in the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. The Frisian languages is the closest living language group to English languages, and are together grouped into the Anglo-Frisian languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to foreign influences. The three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch, Danish, and/or Low German, depending upon their location. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the Great Yarmouth area, Friesland, and Denmark are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long Hanseatic League of the Late Middle Ages.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ara Raoul Parseghian (May 21, 1923 - August 2, 2017) was an American football player and coach who guided the University of Notre Dame to national championships in 1966 and 1973. He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy as a part of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Notre Dame head coaches. Parseghian grew up in Akron, Ohio, and played football beginning in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the University of Akron, but soon quit to join the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II. Parseghian quickly turned things around in 1964; he re-established a sense of confidence and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized with the help of a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He invigorated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.  Parseghian also recognized talent in quarterback John Huarte and wide receiver Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6-4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5-5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs in the country in the pre-season AP Poll.  Notre Dame nonetheless opened the season with a 31-7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40-0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20-17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.  Huarte passed for 2,062 yards and set 12 school records in 1964, four of which still stood as of 2009. He also won the Heisman Trophy. Snow led the country in receptions, with 60. Parseghian, meanwhile, won numerous coach of the year awards for engineering the turnaround, including from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association of America, the Washington Touchdown Club, the Columbus Touchdown Club, and Football News.  Huarte and Snow graduated after the 1964 season, and Notre Dame felt their absence the following year, posting a 7-2-1 record. While the team did not contend for a national title, defensive back Nick Rassas led the nation in punt returns and came in sixth in interceptions; he was named a first-team All-American by sportswriters. Any players of note?","output":"Yes, there were players of note mentioned in the article.

Answer:","output":"Answer: The name of the company which sells Nespresso products is Nestlé."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.  Paragraph: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick.  He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","output":"The centripetal force on the bucket will increase as Adam spins it faster. This is because centripetal force is directly proportional to the square of the speed of the object in circular motion, as well as the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the radius of the circle. The formula for centripetal force is: F_c = (m * v^2) / r where F_c is the centripetal force, m is the mass of the object (the bucket in this case), v is the speed of the object in circular motion, and r is the radius of the circle. As Adam spins the bucket faster, the speed (v) in the circular motion increases, which in turn increases the centripetal force on the bucket. This increased force is what keeps the water in the bucket, preventing it from falling out even when the bucket is upside down during the rotation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Sentence 2: Eventually people become happy with living on garbage dumps. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences appear to be contradictory, which implies that if the first sentence is considered true, the second sentence cannot be true at the same time. To analyze this further, let's break down and examine the meaning and context behind each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"And eventually people are no longer eager to live on garbage dumps.\\" This sentence suggests that at some point in time, people stop being excited or interested in living on garbage dumps. This could imply that they have moved away from the garbage dumps, found an alternative way of living, or their circumstances have changed, making the idea of living on garbage dumps no longer appealing. Sentence 2: \\"Eventually people become happy with living on garbage dumps.\\" In this sentence, it is stated that over time, people become content or satisfied with living on garbage dumps. This could be due to a change in their perspectives, adaptation to the environment, or simply because they find happiness in their current living situation. Now, let's address the question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? As mentioned previously, if we consider the first sentence to be a fact (meaning people are no longer eager to live on garbage dumps), it contradicts the second sentence, which claims that people eventually become happy living on garbage dumps. These two sentences describe opposite circumstances, and as such, they cannot both be true at the same time. However, it's important to recognize that these sentences can also be understood differently depending on the context in which they are placed. For instance, if we were discussing two different groups of people or examining different periods of time, it's possible for both of these sentences to be accurate. One group may no longer be eager to live on garbage dumps, while another group has found happiness in that lifestyle. Alternatively, people could have been content living on garbage dumps at one point in time, but later changed their views and stopped being eager to live in such conditions. In summary, based solely on the information provided within each sentence and without additional context, it is difficult to consider the second sentence true if we assume the first sentence is already true. However, in different contexts or scenarios, both sentences could be valid and describe different situations occurring either across various groups of people or different time periods."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Following the end of the period of Greek influence, what major ancient power took control of Egypt?\\" is in \\"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year.

He had a particular taste for honey, which he thought was the perfect sweetener for his breakfast. In fact, he was so passionate about the incredible golden liquid that he had even taken up beekeeping as a hobby. Jamie would wake up early in the morning, put on his beekeeping suit, and head out to his backyard apiary. He loved to check on his bees, making sure they were healthy and that their hives were in good shape. Over the years, he had become quite knowledgeable about bees and honey production. For Jamie, there was something magical about the entire process – from the bees pollinating flowers and collecting nectar to the transformation of the nectar into rich, sweet honey. He couldn't get enough of the natural goodness that came from these tiny, hardworking insects. After his morning beekeeping routine, Jamie would head back inside to prepare his breakfast. He'd whisk up waffle batter, pour it into his preheated waffle iron, and wait for the delightful aroma to fill his kitchen. When his waffles were golden and crispy, he'd pull them out, slather them with a generous helping of his bees' honey, and enjoy every last bite of his homemade breakfast. Jamie's love for honey even extended to his social life. He often invited friends and family over to taste test new honey varieties and educate them about the importance of bees and the process of creating honey. For Jamie, this wasn't just a simple preference for honey on his waffles; it was a true passion that brought him endless satisfaction and joy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is American historians, while noting that Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were indeed active Masons, have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in causing the American Revolution because the Masonic order was non-political and included both Patriots and their enemy the Loyalists. a good answer to this question? OPTIONS:  (A). yes.  (B). no.","output":"(B). No. While the provided answer does give information about Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and the involvement of Freemasonry in American history, it does not directly address the question about the major opponent to Freemasonry. For a more appropriate answer, we can look at the historical context and some key opposing figures or groups. Throughout its history, Freemasonry has faced opposition from various individuals and organizations, but it's difficult to pinpoint a single \\"major opponent.\\" The opposition often stemmed from religious, political, or social concerns. Here's a more detailed answer to the question: 1. Religious Opposition: The Catholic Church has been one of the most prominent opponents of Freemasonry since the organization's emergence in the 18th century. In 1738, Pope Clement XII issued the papal bull \\"In Eminenti Apostolatus Specula,\\" which condemned Freemasonry and forbade Catholics from joining its ranks. The Catholic Church has reiterated its anti-Masonic stance through various encyclicals and statements under different popes, including Pope Leo XIII's \\"Humanum Genus\\" (1884) and the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which explicitly mentions the prohibition of membership. Protestant denominations have also expressed opposition, with some seeing Masonic rituals and teachings as incompatible with Christian beliefs and values.  2. Political Opposition: Anti-Masonic political movements have emerged at various times and places. In the United States, the Anti-Masonic Party was formed in the late 1820s, following the mysterious disappearance and presumed murder of William Morgan, an ex-Mason who had threatened to expose the secrets of the fraternity. The Anti-Masonic Party became the first \\"third-party\\" in American politics and was influential in the elections of the 1830s. Internationally, Freemasonry was outlawed and targeted in totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler and in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, where the fraternity was seen as a potential threat to state control. Freemasonry was also banned in Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini and during Francisco Franco's dictatorship in Spain. 3. Social Opposition: Various conspiracy theories and fear of secrecy have fueled opposition to Freemasonry throughout its history. Critics often accuse the organization of being a secretive and exclusive society that wields undue influence in politics, business, and social circles. These critics argue that the secretive nature and fraternal structure of the Freemasons serve to protect their members and promote their interests at the expense of non-members. While multiple opponents have been adverse to Freemasonry over time from different dimensions, it is not accurate to identify a single major opponent. Opposition to Freemasonry comes from varying religious, political, and social contexts that have evolved throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A primary school in Wuhan has used new desks and chairs to prevent students from getting short sight. The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school. She said the new desks and chairs were provided by an eye care centre in the city. The school carried out a survey last September. It showed that about 7 percent of its 1,093 students said they suffered from short sight. The new desks and chairs have already improved the students' posture, but both teachers and students might need more time to get used to them. Yang Lihua is head of the Wuhan Youth Eye Care Center. She said the desks and chairs were introduced to 19 schools on a trial basis. \\"During our research into short sight, we noticed that the number of students with short sight was increasing. This is because parents are teaching their children to read and write at a very early age without paying enough attention to their posture,\\" she said. Feng Junying is a doctor at Beijing Jingshan School. \\"I think the new desks and chairs in Wuhan will certainly be helpful,\\" she said. \\"But bad reading habits at school are not the only reason for short sight.

After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred I of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip and Tancred. Its main terms were:  Joan was to receive 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept.  Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred's daughter.  The two kings stayed on in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip Augustus plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys (who had supposedly been the mistress of Richard's father Henry II).

Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency.

I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  Answer this question please: Which island used more oil?","output":"Based on your given situation, Grey Island used more oil. You've mentioned that both Grey Island and Sand Island have contributed to global warming, but Grey Island contributed more due to their carelessness. Since global warming is significantly affected by the burning of fossil fuels, which includes coal and oil, it's likely that Grey Island's greater contribution to global warming means they have burned more fossil fuels, thus meaning they used more oil than Sand Island."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some say that the wand finds the wizard. When you are in tune with your wand, you’ll know what spells you can cast with it. Common spells include:  Love spells to attract love, seduce a mate, or heal a broken heart. Beauty spells. These often encompass height or weight adjustment or improving self-image. Money spells that focus on wealth, prosperity, power, or good fortune. Protection spells to shield someone from negative energy, to protect a home or specific place, and to ward off dark magic, for example. This is important prior to using a wand. There are several considerations to take into account before casting a spell.  Consider what you plan on calling for--exactly what you want--and think about how this will bring yourself harmony. Determine whether or not your use of the wand will cause harm, and specifically how it will affect others. Strokes are simply the movements that you make with your wand. They are a way of bringing your inner intentions to the external world. Different people use a different number of strokes when casting a spell. It might be helpful to think of each stroke as forming a letter. Some say this is how the word spell came into being—by spelling out your intention with strokes. Incantations are sung spells. The word comes from the Latin stem “canto,” which means to sing. Incantations put out powerful vibrations into the universe, and entrust your will to whatever higher deity you ascribe to. Like anything else, practice is necessary to make a spell work. Sometimes a spell might not come to fruition for a period of years. In other instances, you'll see more imminent results that show your energy manifesting itself in the universe.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of being in tune with one's wand in order to effectively cast spells.

ObamaCare in peril? Questionable sign-ups, delays mar launch Three weeks out from the ObamaCare enrollment deadline, the president's signature health care law is facing ever-increasing challenges which go far beyond the program's troubled exchange websites. Raising questions whether it's a crippled law that's near impossible to implement along its mandated timetable, key elements of the act continue to unilaterally be pushed off by the administration. Lawmakers are raising concerns about the security of the ObamaCare websites, even as the many \\"glitches\\" that blocked would-be enrollees are fixed. And at the heart of the Affordable Care Act's problems is the question of whether it will do what President Obama said -- cover a large swath of the country's 47 million uninsured. The numbers the administration is using to tout its progress to that end are coming under the microscope. While officials say 4 million have signed up for private insurance on the exchanges so far -- still short of the unofficial 7 million goal by the end of March -- it's unclear how many of them were previously uninsured. A new pair of studies suggests not very many, meaning Obama's target audience largely has not been reached. A startling study by McKinsey & Co. showed that of the uninsured eligible to sign up for an ObamaCare private plan, just 10 percent said they had done so. Further, it found that just a quarter of those who did sign up for coverage in the marketplaces were previously uninsured. That suggests the bulk of those signing up are simply switching from one plan to another, some facing higher premiums in the process. Further, the administration apparently has no idea how successful the program is when it comes to the core goal of signing up the uninsured. The National Journal reported that Gary Cohen, the health official at the helm of the insurance marketplaces who will soon be stepping down, said the administration is not really tracking that. \\"That's not a data point that we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way,\\" Cohen reportedly said. Health agency spokesman Aaron Albright told Fox News on Friday that they are now \\"looking at a range of data sources\\" to figure that out. Reports of slow sign-ups and rising premiums have only emboldened Republicans fighting against the law. Four years after its passage, the law's defeat was still the central rallying cry at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington this week. \\"When ObamaCare was debated in Congress, we screamed from the rooftops that it just wouldn't work -- that it would be a job killer; that it would absolutely make health care more expensive and less accessible for millions of Americans,\\" Sen John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Friday at the conference. \\"We were accused of somehow being heartless and misinformed. But now, four years later, our predictions have come true.\\" The other chunk of ObamaCare-related sign-ups comes from Medicaid, which was expanded under the health care law. But while the administration recently touted that nearly 9 million were found eligible since the October launch, new estimates show just about 3 million of them were newly registered because of the health care law. The central concern at this stage is whether the insurance industry is seeing enough sign-ups -- insurers were relying on an infusion of young and healthy customers in order to offset the cost of insuring everyone else and complying with other provisions in the law. Without the proper mix of customers, premiums could rise. Asked about the McKinsey study, America's Health Insurance Plans spokesman Robert Zirkelbach said that what \\"ultimately matters\\" is who signs up, not necessarily how many sign up. Meanwhile, other implementation problems threaten to exacerbate the industry's concerns. The administration this week announced that it would let people keep plans that would otherwise be out of compliance for another two years. This was an extension of a \\"fix\\" Obama made for all those whose policies were canceled, after he was accused of misleading voters in claiming anyone who liked their health plan could keep it. But that potentially deprives insurers of even more revenue. Insurance industry consultant Robert Laszewski reportedly said this week that insurers are \\"very worried\\" now about the sign-ups. Hanging over all of these implementation problems is the 2014 midterm elections, and a sizeable group of Democrats nervous about the law's more unpopular provisions going into that vote. Lead among them would be the individual mandate requiring people to buy insurance. In the latest dose of bad news, The Wall Street Journal reported that, according to the Tax Policy Center, the penalty for not buying insurance could be a lot higher than the 95 fine Americans usually hear about. The House voted Wednesday to delay the tax penalty for one year, with more than two-dozen Democrats supporting the bill. In another looming confrontation, House Republicans plan to tie the so-called \\"doc fix\\" to a decade-long postponement of the mandate. The \\"doc fix\\" is a semi-routine patch by Congress to prevent doctors from seeing a massive cut in their Medicare reimbursement rate. The current one runs out at the end of this month. A spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the GOP plan a \\"new low.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the challenges ObamaCare faced three weeks before its enrollment deadline. The Affordable Care Act aimed to cover a large portion of the country's uninsured people, but many elements of the act were being delayed. The administration's claim of 4 million people signing up for coverage was facing scrutiny, as it was unclear how many were previously uninsured. The Insurance industry was also concerned about the number and types of people signing up. All these problems added to political concerns for the Democrats ahead of the midterm elections."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What are some examples?\\" Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices: (i) no (ii) yes","output":"To address the first question, a \\"nonvolatile solution\\" refers to a solution in which the solute does not have a significant vapor pressure at a given temperature, meaning it has less tendency to evaporate or transform from its liquid state into its gaseous state. This makes nonvolatile solutes useful in applications where evaporation could cause concentration changes or unwanted side effects. Examples of nonvolatile solutes include salts, sugars, and large organic molecules. Now, answering the second question, a \\"dilute solution\\" is a solution where there is a relatively low concentration of solute present in the solvent. In these solutions, a small amount of solute is dissolved in a large amount of solvent, causing the properties of the solvent to be less affected by the solute. Examples of dilute solutions can include tap water (dilute impurities), saline solution (0.9% NaCl in water), or dilute vinegar (low concentration of acetic acid in water). Step-by-step justification: 1. Define a nonvolatile solution and provide examples. 2. Define a dilute solution and provide examples. With these definitions and examples in mind, I proceed to answer the multiple-choice question. I would say that the questions are not the same, so I choose option (i) no.

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises.

There should be something in the bottom of the wheel to hold the clay in place. In a real wheel, I assume the weight of the clay holds it in place.

Solve -81*b - 576 + 1652 + 706 = 0 for b. Solve this problem.","output":"Sure, let's solve the equation step-by-step: 1. First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constant terms.    -81*b - 576 + 1652 + 706 = 0    Add the constants:    -576 + 1652 + 706 = 1782 - 576 = 1206 2. So, the equation becomes:    -81*b + 1206 = 0 3. Now, isolate 'b' by moving the constant to the other side of the equation:    -81*b = -1206 4. To find the value of 'b', divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'b' which is -81:    b = -1206 / -81 5. Lastly, calculate the value of 'b':    b = 1206/81    b = 14.88888888 (approximately) So the approximate value of 'b' for this equation is 14.89."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

For instance, you could say something like, \\" i'd rather not talk about that, \\" or, \\" it's a long story, but now isn't the time to tell it. Option (a) is the correct answer as it encourages the individual to set boundaries regarding their personal experiences with self-harm scars. It emphasizes the importance of politely asserting one's preference not to discuss the topic if they are uncomfortable. Option (b) is incorrect because it focuses on the frequency of the scars disappearing, which is irrelevant to the context of answering questions about self-harm scars. Additionally, it seems to mix two different points of view and provides confusing instructions. Option (c) is incorrect because it suggests avoiding talking about the scars over the phone, which is not a necessary guideline for everyone. The original statement makes it clear that the individual has the right to choose whether or not to discuss their scars, and the context of the conversation (over the phone or in-person) should be based on their personal preference. Option (d) is incorrect as it distorts the meaning of the original statement. Being honest about one's scars is not the same as feeling obligated to talk about them.

This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels.

It can take a short sleep. Or it can sleep for days at a time. And it spends all the winter months in its shell, asleep. In spring the snail wakes up. Its body, about three inches long, comes out of from the shell. When hungry, the snail looks for food. It can't see very well. Its eyes, at the ends of the top feelers are very weak.

Question: How does Stevens die? Title: Miami Vice Movie plot: While working an undercover prostitute sting operation in a nightclub to arrest a pimp named Neptune, Miami-Dade Police detectives James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett and Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Tubbs receive a frantic phone call from their former informant Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes). Stevens reveals that he's leaving town, and, believing his wife Leonetta to be in immediate danger, asks Rico to check on her. Crockett learns that Stevens was working as an informant for the FBI but has been compromised. Crockett and Tubbs quickly contact FBI Special Agent in Charge John Fujima (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and warn him about Stevens' safety. Tracking down Stevens through a vehicle transponder and aerial surveillance, Crockett and Tubbs stop him along I-95. Stevens reveals that a Colombian cartel had become aware that Russian undercovers (now dead) were working with the FBI, and had threatened to murder Leonetta via a C-4 necklace bomb if he didn't confess. Rico, learning of Leonetta's death by telephone call, tells Alonzo that he doesn't have to go home. Hearing this, the grief-stricken Stevens commits suicide by walking in front of an oncoming semi truck. En route to the murder scene, Sonny and Rico receive a call from Lt. Castillo (Barry Shabaka Henley) and are instructed to stay away. He tells them to meet him downtown, where they are introduced in person to John Fujima, head of the Florida Joint Inter-Agency Task Force between the FBI, the DEA, and ICE. Crockett and Tubbs berate Fujima for the errors committed and inquire as to why the MPD wasn't involved. Fujima reveals that the Colombian group is highly sophisticated and run by JosÃ© Yero (John Ortiz), initially thought to be the cartel's leader. Fujima enlists Crockett and Tubbs, making them Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force deputies, to help, and they continue the investigation by looking into go-fast boats coming from the Caribbean, delivering loads of narcotics from the Colombians.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many cells are produced during the cell cycle Suggested answer: In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"It seems that the suggested answer does not directly address the question you have presented about the number of cells produced during the cell cycle. I will provide you with a detailed answer to your original question. The cell cycle is a series of events that occur in a cell, leading to its growth, replication, and division, producing two daughter cells. The cell cycle is divided into two main phases: interphase and the mitotic (M) phase. During interphase, the cell grows and replicates its DNA. It consists of three subphases: 1. G1 phase: The cell grows and carries out its normal functions. 2. S phase: The cell replicates its DNA, effectively doubling the genetic material. 3. G2 phase: The cell continues to grow and prepares for division. When the cell enters the M phase, it undergoes a process called mitosis, where the chromosomes align, separate, and finally divide into two new nuclei. This is followed by cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells. So, to answer your question, a single cell undergoes one cell cycle to produce two daughter cells. These two daughter cells are identical copies of the original cell, each carrying the same genetic material as the parent cell. The suggested answer you provided is more relevant to the context of meiosis, a different type of cell division that results in the production of gametes, which have half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell. In meiosis, one cell divides twice, producing four haploid cells (gametes), such as sperm and egg cells in animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer a question about the following article about Cork (city): The city's municipal government was dominated by about 12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe — in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine. The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. The title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent Mayor by Queen Victoria on her Royal visit to the city.

The Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was primarily spread through the bites of infected fleas that lived on small mammals, particularly black rats. This highly contagious disease swept through Europe in the mid-14th century and caused widespread social and economic upheaval, killing an estimated 75-200 million people in Eurasia.

Question: What movie was the probable inspiration for the opening image of an immobile young woman clad in Gold.

They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of Night of the Ghouls (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line.

There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.[1] The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \\"Princess of the Night\\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.[1] As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery.[1] The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the...

One of the best ways to deal with rejection is to find your tribe. Identify others who share your interests, values, and beliefs and forge relationships with these people. When you do this, you will feel more confident about yourself and your story. Connect with others by joining clubs and organizations in your local community and online. Just because one person in your family rejected you, doesn’t mean everyone will. Get in touch with your other parent (unless they rejected you, also), siblings, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. If these people are willing to support you, let them. As hard as it is to believe, there are others who have gone through similar experiences as yours. Search online or in your local area for support groups that help you connect with these people. You may find a new support system and an outlet for coping by meeting with others who’ve gone through what you have. For instance, if your parent rejected you because of your sexual orientation, you might search for a support group for youths who recently  came out of the closet. There are a range of negative effects from parental rejection, such as anger, insecurity, or depression. In the weeks, months, and years that follow, you may need help coming to terms with the rejection and owning your story. A professional mental health therapist can help you do this.

B. \\"Jeff\\" Jefferies (James Stewart), is confined to a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment to recuperate. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful heat wave he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool. He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames \\"Miss Torso\\"; a single middle-aged woman he calls \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife. Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful socialite girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant. One night during a thunderstorm Jeff hears a woman scream \\"Don't!\\" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), a New York City Police detective, and asks him to do some research.

Write the answer: \\"Who is credited with the quote, famous in US history: \\"\\"I have not yet begun to fight\\"\\"?\\"","output":"The quote \\"I have not yet begun to fight\\" is famously attributed to John Paul Jones, a prominent figure in the United States Naval history. Born in Scotland on July 6, 1747, John Paul Jones started his maritime career at a very young age. An experienced sailor, he eventually settled in America during the years leading up to the American Revolutionary War. Jones sided with the colonies in their struggle for independence from Great Britain, and the burgeoning United States Congress appointed him to the rank of a naval officer. The iconic quote was a part of a dramatic exchange that occurred during the Battle of Flamborough Head on September 23, 1779. Best known for his daring raids and exploits in British waters, John Paul Jones was tasked with capturing British vessels and crippling their naval supremacy. On this particular day, he was in charge of the USS Bonhomme Richard, which engaged in a fierce battle with the HMS Serapis under Captain Richard Pearson's command. Both the Bonhomme Richard and Serapis were taking heavy damage during the conflict. Captain Richard Pearson called out to Jones, asking if he was ready to surrender and strike his colors (lower the ship's flag), as it was customary to do so in the face of imminent defeat. However, Jones, being tenacious in the pursuit of victory, refused to take such a step and responded defiantly, \\"I have not yet begun to fight!\\" These words served as a rallying cry for Jones and his crew, who continued to battle against the superior British ship. Eventually, they managed to disable the Serapis, and Captain Pearson was forced to surrender. Despite the extent of the damage to the Bonhomme Richard, which ultimately sank two days later, the remarkable turning point of the battle remains a symbol of American resilience in the face of adversity. The famous saying \\"I have not yet begun to fight\\" has become synonymous with John Paul Jones and the determination to persevere even in the most challenging circumstances. Today, Jones is hailed as the \\"Father of the American Navy\\" and is remembered for his enduring contributions to the establishment of the United States Navy, whose officers and sailors continue to uphold the values of bravery and perseverance exemplified by those words."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Carson is a car salesman, and yesterday they struck another deal and made a lot of money.  Given the context: How would Carson feel afterwards?  Possible answers: a wheeler dealer, proud, depressed Answer:","output":"Carson would likely feel proud after striking a successful deal and making a lot of money as a car salesman. As an individual working in the sales industry, one's ability to close deals and generate profit is a direct reflection of their skills and expertise. Therefore, when success in this field is achieved, it naturally brings about a sense of accomplishment and pride. There are several reasons why Carson would feel proud in this situation: 1. Achievement: Successfully closing a deal and making a significant profit demonstrates that Carson is proficient in their role as a car salesman. This accomplishment serves as a reminder that their hard work and diligence are paying off, leading to increased self-confidence and a sense of achievement. 2. Skill showcase: Negotiating and finalizing a deal requires a range of skills, including strong communication, persuasion, and even psychological understanding of the buyer's needs and preferences. By successfully navigating through these challenges, Carson has showcased their ability to effectively utilize these skills and has reason to feel proud of this mastery. 3. Recognition: Successful salespeople are often recognized and rewarded by their employers, peers, and even customers. This recognition, in turn, elevates the individual's standing within the workplace and contributes to a sense of pride in their accomplishments. 4. Monetary rewards: Carson's success in this deal resulted in a considerable monetary gain. This tangible reward not only demonstrates their effectiveness as a salesperson but also contributes to feelings of success and pride in their work. While the term \\"wheeler dealer\\" could also be used to describe someone who is adept at closing deals in the car sales industry, it often carries a negative connotation and can imply that the person uses unethical or dishonest tactics to achieve their goals. In this context, it is more appropriate to focus on the emotions and experiences that Carson would likely feel due to their accomplishment. In conclusion, given the successful deal closure and the significant profit made by Carson, they would likely feel proud of their accomplishment. This pride is a result of their ability to effectively utilize their sales and negotiation skills, which directly contributed to their success, and the tangible rewards and recognition that often accompany such achievements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. Question: When did the cab driver have enough money to only work 1 job?

Intersex is in some caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes. One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues). Thus, testicular and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can u be born with both male and female parts?  * no. * yes.","output":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that there are multiple potential causes for the development of intersex conditions in humans.

You know, the good ol’ nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Help as much as you can. Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

The children's Theater was actually an old mill building with cement walls, twisting passages and big staircases. One afternoon, my eight-year-old sister Brittany and I were with the drama group rehearsing A Little Princess, a children's play. \\"Good luck!\\" I whispered as Brittany adjusted her boarding school costume.  \\"Take your places for act one, please. Everyone, places for act one!\\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay.  Ten minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \\"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \\"All the other girls laughed, too.\\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister !  When we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her.  Before the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \\"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\\" she said.  But Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way.  It was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform. There would be three performances over the course of the next weekend. Brittany and I were glad that the ordeal was almost over.  After the first show, Brittany and I each got a beautiful bouquet from our church's pastor and his wife. Jessica didn't get a single flower. The second night, we received flowers from our grandparents. Again, Jessica received nothing.  On the way home, Brittany spoke up. \\"Mommy\\", she said quietly from the back seat of the car, \\"I've been thinking, and I decided to buy some flowers for Jessica,\\" Mom smiled in surprise and replied, \\"That would be very nice.\\"  Before the last performance, Brittany met Jessica on the way to the theater. She handed the older girl a big bunch of yellow roses, bought with her own savings. \\"Great job with the show last night, Jessica. These are for you.\\" Jessica was astonished. \\"For me?\\" she said. \\"These flowers are for me? Are you sure?\\" \\"Yes I want you to have them!\\" Brittany skipped towards the dressing room, leaving Jessica staring at her with a confused look on her face and a bouquet of beautiful flowers in her arms.  That night, Jessica finally received some flowers from her dad. She pulled out a spring of carnations and smiled shyly as she gave them to Brittany.  Maybe Jessica will never apologize to Brittany.

Supt Mark Kenny, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), urged criminal gangs \\"not take action into their own hands\\". He said uniformed officers were not at the funeral, but armed response teams were on standby. They stopped the traffic on a busy road in Salford to allow a funeral cortege to pass by. A pipe band played and crowds lining the street applauded as the white, horse-drawn carriage came into view. But they weren't here to say farewell to a local dignitary or celebrity. This was the funeral of Paul Massey, once dubbed the Mr Big of Salford's criminal underworld. He'd served time for stabbing a man in 1999. In recent years the 55-year-old had attempted to rebrand himself as a businessman and politician - standing for mayor of Salford in 2015. He was shot dead outside his home last month - bringing to fruition his own prophecy, made years earlier, that one day he would fall to a bullet. The search for his killer continues. \\"Do not take action into your own hands,\\" said Mr Kenny in a BBC interview, appealing directly to criminals. \\"Speak to the police, speak to us. \\"I very much hope it is a family day and it is very much about respect for the family. \\"If anything did happen we will respond appropriately and deal with it.\\" He said, contrary to some reports, that Mr Massey was \\"absolutely not\\" a mediator for police. Mr Kenny denied Salford was \\"a lawless city\\" and \\"at the heart of it there is a really good community\\". But he acknowledged there were \\"areas of deprivation and individuals who sometimes come together and cause serious crime\\". Mr Kenny said although there were 19 gangs in Salford, \\"clearly they are a minority in Salford engaged in criminality.\\" GMP officers have targeted gangs in the city and since January have made 100 arrests and have eight money-laundering investigations. They have also seized 26 firearms, more than Â£9m of drugs money and large amounts of ammunition. In 1999, Mr Massey was sentenced to 14 years for stabbing a man in the groin outside a nightclub. He was given the title Mr Big by the late Salford councillor Joe Burrows at a meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992  - which he always denied having anything to do with. In 2012, he was unsuccessful in his mayoral bid, polling 1,995 votes - 4.45% of the poll - and coming seventh out of 10 candidates. Summary:","output":"A man named Paul Massey, who used to be involved in doing bad things, had a special funeral with a lot of people watching. He was shot by someone wearing a mask and the police are still looking for the person who did it. The police officer wants people to help them find the bad guy and not to try and do it by themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a young boy, I always sort of hated \\"Cinderella,\\" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy. I wanted \\"Dumbo,\\" but my sisters won out, and we got \\"Cinderella.\\" They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures. A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched \\"Cinderella\\" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched \\"Cinderella\\" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like \\"Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo\\" and \\"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\\" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle. Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world. While \\"Cinderella\\" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids. I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.

Q: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible...

The simplest type of MP3 file uses one bit rate for the entire file: this is known as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) encoding. Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as Variable Bit Rate (VBR) files. The idea behind this is that, in any piece of audio, some parts will be much easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few instruments, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly. Users who know a particular \\"quality setting\\" that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.

Given the two facts above, what decreases stamina?  -- water. -- liver cancer. -- cancer. -- food. -- cigarettes. -- burning. -- toxins. -- exercise. The answer is:","output":"cigarettes. Given the two facts provided, it becomes clear that smoking tobacco decreases stamina, and tobacco is smoked in various forms, including pipes, cigarettes, or bidis. Among the options given, cigarettes are directly related to smoking tobacco, which is the primary cause of decreased stamina.  To go into more detail, the act of smoking cigarettes introduces harmful toxins and chemicals into the body, such as nicotine and carbon monoxide. These toxins lead to various negative effects on the human body. One such effect is the decrease in stamina. Smoking tobacco through cigarettes can cause the following issues, which contribute to a decrease in stamina: 1. Reduced oxygen availability: The carbon monoxide present in the smoke from tobacco, especially in cigarettes, binds to the hemoglobin in the blood. As a result, less oxygen is available for the organs and muscles, leading to reduced stamina. 2. Constricted blood vessels: Nicotine has a constriction effect on blood vessels, reducing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. This constriction can impair the functioning of muscles and organs, further decreasing stamina. 3. Decrease in lung function: Smoking cigarettes can lead to the development of chronic lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema. These diseases affect lung capacity and the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, ultimately leading to a decrease in overall stamina. 4. Weakening of the immune system: Smoking cigarettes can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to various infections and illnesses. A weakened immune system may result in reduced stamina as the body constantly battles against infections, rather than using that energy for physical activities. It is essential to note that while cigarettes are the answer given the context of the provided facts, other indirect factors such as toxins, cancer, and decreased exercise capacity may also contribute to the decrease in stamina in the long run. Quitting smoking or limiting exposure to cigarette smoke is crucial for maintaining overall health and boosting stamina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Order Context: Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is a member of an arcane order of priests known as Carolingians. When the head of the Order dies, Alex is sent to Rome by a priest named Driscoll (Peter Weller) to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death. The body bears strange marks on the chest which may or may not be the sign of a Sin Eater (Benno Fürmann). Alex begins to research this being and discovers that he is an entity existing outside the confines of time (the current sin-eater was born during the Renaissance) who offers absolution, last rites and therefore a path to Heaven outside the jurisdiction of the Church for those the church deems unqualified for the traditional last rites.Alex enlists the aid of his old comrade Father Thomas Garrett (Mark Addy) and of a troubled artist (Shannyn Sossamon) upon whom he once performed an exorcism. Thomas seeks the counsel of a mysterious hooded figure, apparently the head of some pagan cult existing, literally, in the Roman underworld. They are told how to find the \\"other\\" (the sin-eater), who eventually contacts Alex at St. Peter's Cathedral. William Eden (Benno Fürmann), the sin-eater, introduces Alex to his world, explains how he became the sin-eater, demonstrates the rite for him, all in hopes that Alex will take his place and become the next sin-eater. Alex, meanwhile, realizes that his love for Mara can no longer be denied. He leaves the priesthood for her, and rejects Eden's offer.Not to be denied, Eden murders Mara, removing the only obstacle to Alex assuming the role. Alex, knowing the Mara was murdered by Eden, but acting on incomplete information found on an ancient parchment, decides to kill Eden to rid the world of the sin-eater, but in doing so completes the ritual to become the sin-eater. The movie ends with Alex answering the call of Driscoll. Revealed to be the head of the pagan cult and disgraced at the Vatican, Driscoll decides to commit suicide and calls for the sin-eater to provide absolution. He is surprised when it is Alex and not Eden...

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - Hydraulic mining, or hydraulicking, is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment.

It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.  - Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, (sedimentary rocks).  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas.  - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California and an internationally acclaimed actor, admitted in 2011 to fathering a child, Joseph Baena, with his then housekeeper, Mildred Baena. It is true that he found out about Joseph only seven or eight years after his birth, making the child's existence public in 2011. Joseph Baena was born in 1997, which means that Arnold discovered the truth around 2004 or 2005. Although some details of the situation remain private, it has been reported that Schwarzenegger bought a four-bedroom house for Mildred Baena and their son Joseph in 2010. This purchase happened shortly before the news of their affair and the existence of their child became public in 2011. The house is located in Bakersfield, California, and offered more privacy for the family. So, the correct answer is that Arnold Schwarzenegger bought a four-bedroom house for Mildred Baena and their son in 2010."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices:  (a). issue an edict to Carson  (b). look at the costs  (c). edit the edict I heard that Carson issued an edict to Kendall to ask her to build an army.  And I was wondering What will Kendall want to do next? Answer:","output":"To determine what Kendall will likely want to do next, let's go through the choices step-by-step: Step 1: Analyze the choices (a) Issue an edict to Carson: This choice involves Kendall issuing an order or proclamation to Carson. Since Carson has already issued an edict to Kendall for building an army, it might not be the most logical next step for Kendall to issue another edict back to Carson without first addressing the original request. (b) Look at the costs: This choice involves Kendall examining the financial and resource implications of building an army. This makes sense for Kendall to do next, as it allows her to assess what it will take to fulfill Carson's request. (c) Edit the edict: This choice involves Kendall making changes to the edict received from Carson. This may also make sense for Kendall, as she could edit the edict to address any concerns or clarify certain aspects of building the army. Step 2: Determine the most logical next step Considering the previously analyzed choices, the most logical next step for Kendall would be to either (b) look at the costs associated with building an army or (c) edit the edict to address any concerns or clarify terms. Step 3: Justify the choice In this case, it seems that choice (b), looking at the costs, would be the most appropriate and immediate action for Kendall to take. This is because, before making any changes to the edict or issuing a response, Kendall would likely want to have a clear understanding of the resources, personnel, and financial commitments required to build an army. Once she has this information, she can then decide if she wants to proceed with the request, seek additional clarification from Carson, or edit the edict. Answer: Kendall will likely want to (b) look at the costs associated with building an army next."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?  Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Which gardener had more mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system?  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. A:","output":"Bill had more mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system, as he used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden while Hank used regular top soil.

This is the astonishing moment holidaymakers watched wild dolphins put on a show for them just yards away from a Cornish beach. Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming. Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving last Friday. Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: ‘It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw. 'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.’ Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to 21C (70F) over the weekend. Mrs Drabble said lifeguards eventually managed to encourage the dolphins away from swimmers, with the help of a helicopter. Scroll down for video. Impressive: Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming on Friday. Watching: Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving beneath the waves. Hot weather: Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to the 21C over the weekend. ¿Breathtaking¿: People on the beach in Cornwall were said to have been cheering as the dolphins jumped out of the water. Time to leave: Lifeguards urged people to stay away from the dolphins, before a helicopter was used to encourage them to swim back out into open water. Some 28 species of cetacean have been recorded in UK waters, with 11 of these regularly appearing, according to Government figures. Dolphins can be viewed from places such as Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth near Inverness, as well as Cardigan Bay in Wales. They can also be seen around Land's End in Cornwall from January to April, as well as on the east coast of Scotland between July and September. It is illegal under British law to intentionally kill or injure a dolphin, or ‘recklessly disturb’ one - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat. Fishermen with larger vessels are obliged to fit acoustic deterrent devices to deter dolphins from approaching them, and reducing by-catch levels. They are also advised to reel in their lines if dolphins appear while fishing, before moving away from an area if the cetaceans do not leave first. Dolphins are powerful animals that can become aggressive towards humans, and it can be harmful for both parties if people attempt feeding. Two decades ago US officials had to issue guidance on this subject after people were seen in Florida feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs and sweets. It is recommended that people get no closer than 50 yards to dolphins, because they can feel harassed if you get too close to them. In addition, dolphins have delicate skin which is very sensitive to human touch and therefore can be at risk of harm from humans. Warmer sees could be behind a rise for a change in the type of dolphins spotted off the North East, a survey suggested four years ago. A rise in sightings of common, bottlenose and Risso's dolphins - associated with warmer waters - was reported by the North East Cetacean Project. Among the cetaceans whose numbers sighted off the UK have increased over the past 30 years are the common dolphin and striped dolphin. Highlights:","output":"1.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Dan visited Twin lakes every year. The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.  But I can use this background: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released.  What is an answer for this question: Which body of water held more dissolved oxygen? The answer is:","output":"The body of water that held more dissolved oxygen would be Twin I, the lake with very cold water all year round. The reasoning behind this answer lies in the relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels, as explained in the provided background information. According to Henry's Law, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases as the water temperature increases. This means that colder water can hold more dissolved oxygen than warmer water. In the situation described, Twin I has cold water throughout the year, while Twin II has warm water. Considering the relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen, it can be inferred that Twin I, with its consistently cold water, would have a higher capacity to hold dissolved oxygen compared to Twin II, which has warm water.  Additionally, the susceptibility of bodies of water to anoxic conditions during warmer times of the day and summer months further supports the conclusion that Twin I would have more dissolved oxygen. Anoxic conditions are characterized by a severe depletion or absence of oxygen in the water. As Twin II has warm waters year-round, it would be more prone to experiencing anoxic conditions, and consequently, lower levels of dissolved oxygen. In summary, based on the principles of Henry's Law and the factors that affect the dissolved oxygen levels in bodies of water, Twin I, the lake with cold water all year, would hold more dissolved oxygen than Twin II, which has warm waters year-round."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie's red carpet debut is October 20th. #YouShouldKnow is a feature that showcases rising talents. To see more past interviews, including more features on Sean O'Donnell, click here. Can you talk to me a bit about how MamaBoy came about? MamaBoy came about like most things for me, where an audition came through and I went to the audition and they came back and said they were interested in me, and I read more and more on it and talked with them. I was really intrigued by the script. It's not a common story. It was a classic audition, go in, get the part, and make the decision about whether or not it's something I want to actually do. I really enjoyed the script for a lot of reasons so I decided to go for it. What really drew you to this project? The main thing was my character Kelly Hankins, he gets to explore every range of human emotion. He starts at the top being captain of the baseball team, with a great family and a beautiful girlfriend and then he gets all of that ripped out from under him and he doesn't know where he falls in life or who he is, and he's self conscious about so many things. Then, he grows to be okay with that and know that he doesn't need anyone else's approval and only his is substantial. As an actor, you want to be able to have an arc throughout a movie, so having one type of emotion is fine, it's fun, but this was challenging for me. Anyone can relate to this character because everyone knows what it's like to be 17 years old and be in high school and feel like your world is falling apart when someone looks at you wrong, because you don't know who you are inside. I really like how that transcends anything. What went into your character of Kelly off-screen? What kind of work did you have to put in to make him come to life? I would say the biggest would definitely have to be being pregnant. I could go my entire life without having to be pregnant again, it was not fun. But I really wanted to make that as believable as possible, it's a comedy and it's funny and absurd, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to take it as seriously as possible, so I watched countless hours of pregnant women and how they walk and sit down and get up from sitting. It seems believable. I also had a lot of conversations with my mother about it too. That was probably the hardest prep I had to do -- being pregnant. What was your favorite moment on set while you were filming? The first time I was actually pregnant, actually, the first time Gary Busey saw me pregnant. He was a little taken aback by it. It looked very real, like disturbingly real. He was not prepared for it and he needed a minute -- it was hilarious. What was it like to work alongside Gary Busey, someone who has been an icon in the industry for so long? It was amazing, honestly. Everyone going into it was saying how you have to be careful because it was going to be hectic, but he was great. He was talking with all of the extras and all of the actors about the history of acting and just giving as many lessons and teachings as he could throughout his days on set, and it was -- he's Gary Busey, he's been around forever -- I was trying to soak up as much as I possibly could from him. I was really blessed to have that experience. What was the biggest thing you learned about yourself as an actor while working on this project? I learned how much I really do love acting, which sounds odd, but it was my first project and you never know if you truly like something until you actually do it. I remember thinking three days into filming, which took two months to finish, that this is exactly what I want to do. It is so much fun and so rewarding. Despite all the rejections you get from previous auditions, this makes it all worth it. What kind of projects do you hope to be working on in the future? What kind of genres do you hope to explore? I hope to move more into serious drama. If I had a dream project, it would be Perks of a Wallflower, Logan Lerman-type character. That's a big goal of mine.

Goal: What is the best time to eat lunch Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"Dear little friend, let's think about the best time for eating lunch. Lunch is the meal we eat in the middle of the day. After having breakfast, your body needs some more energy a few hours later before you have dinner. So, the best time to eat lunch usually depends on when you ate breakfast and when you'll eat dinner. If you had breakfast early, like around 7 AM, it's a good idea to eat lunch around 12 PM or noon. This way, you won't be too hungry and have enough energy for the afternoon. If you had a late breakfast, you can wait a little longer and have lunch at around 1 PM. This still gives you enough time to digest your food before having dinner later. Remember that your body needs time to digest food, so it's important not to wait too long or eat too close to dinner time. Now, let's look at the two methods to find the best time for lunch: Method 1: Consider when you had breakfast and when you'll have dinner. Method 2: Wait until you start feeling hungry but not too hungry. It's more reasonable to use Method 1, where you think about the time you had breakfast and when you'll have dinner, to decide the best time for lunch. This way, you can be sure your body gets the energy it needs when it needs it most, and you'll be ready for more fun and learning in the afternoon!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the potential impact on Manchester United's share prices due to the apparent collapse of a £780 million bid by American sports mogul Malcolm Glazer. The failed bid can lead to increased pressure on Manchester United's share values. Malcolm Glazer, an American businessman and sports team owner, had intended to make a substantial bid to acquire the English football club Manchester United. The bid was controversial because some fans and stakeholders of the club were concerned about Glazer's intentions and its potential impact on Manchester United's financial stability, long-term success, and tradition. The collapse of Glazer's £780 million bid means that the potential acquisition will not take place, which may lead to uncertainty among shareholders and potential volatility in the share prices of Manchester United. The absence of a major investor like Glazer, who could have brought substantial financial resources and business expertise to the club, may influence investors to anticipate lower growth prospects and adjust their expectations accordingly. This could result in the club's share prices experiencing downward pressure in the market.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"You are unable to naturally make yourself taller because height is determined by\\"","output":"You are unable to naturally make yourself taller because height is primarily determined by your genetics and the interactions of various hormones in your body, particularly during your growth period in childhood and adolescence.  Genetics plays a significantly major role in determining an individual's height. This is evident from the observation that tall parents generally have tall children, and vice versa. Scientists believe that height is polygenic, which means multiple genes are involved in determining a person's height. There is no single 'height gene', but rather this trait is influenced by the aggregate effects of many genes.  On top of genetic factors, your height is influenced by hormones. The two key hormones involved in growth are growth hormone (somatotropin) and the thyroid hormones. Growth hormone, produced in the pituitary gland, stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues by promoting the production of proteins and the breakdown of fats. During puberty, sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone become operational and they have different effects on growth. Estrogen causes the growth plates to fuse, which stops the lengthening of bones, whereas testosterone promotes muscular development and a growth spurt in boys. Additionally, height is indirectly impacted by environmental factors such as nutrition, health, and physical activity, especially during childhood and adolescence. For instance, adequate nutrition (particularly proteins, vitamins, and minerals) is necessary for growth and development. Lack of proper nutrition can lead to stunted growth. Moreover, illnesses or chronic diseases can also affect skeletal growth and consequently height. Thus, after the growth plates in your bones have fused during adolescence, you cannot naturally increase your height, because it is a complex trait determined by a combination of genetics and hormonal interactions along with environmental factors during the growth years.

Vicky Zhao is a mainlander working in Hong Kong. For her, one thing she can't put up with is people standing on the wrong side of the escalator  in subway stations. \\"Escalators help us move faster and save time. It isn't a place to rest,\\" the 24-year-old says. \\"I often see tourists block the way with their suitcases or chatting on the escalators during rush hours. _ annoys me to no end.\\" Admitting she is not the patient type, Zhao says things are much better in Hong Kong than in cities on the mainland where \\"stand right, walk left\\" signs are often ignored. The logic behind the \\"stand right, walk left\\" escalator etiquette  seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the \\"stand right, walk left\\" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons. In Hong Kong's subway stations there are regular announcements asking people to \\"stand still\\" on escalators. Even so, most people in thisfast-paced cityobserve the \\"stand right, walk left\\" etiquette. But the people who stand on escalators defend themselves by telling the walkers not to be so impatient. The BBC quotes one stander as saying: \\"If the person is in such a rush, why not just take the stairs? Even when the escalator is packed and there's nowhere to move, I see these same people complaining about not being able to pass.\\" Whatever the escalator etiquette is in the place you live or visit, do what most people are doing and always be mindful of others: leave enough space between each other, don't stay at the end of the escalator, and if someone is blocking...

It highlights a level of empathy towards Riley and potentially creates a sense of bonding between the two. Jan may feel more connected to Riley and appreciative of their thoughtful actions. (2). Kind:  As Riley took the time and effort to make a snack for Jan, it demonstrates a sense of kindness and thoughtfulness on Riley's part, leading Jan to have positive feelings towards Riley. Consequently, Jan would likely feel cared for, respected, and valued by Riley. This, in turn, could strengthen their relationship and create a sense of trust and gratitude. (3). Good to have a snack: The fact that Riley made a snack for Jan indicates a level of considerate hospitality. Jan might feel physically satisfied and content after enjoying the snack, which could contribute to an overall positive emotional state.

The incredible story begins with the discovery of the creature at the Saltdean cliffs. The cliffs are known for their mesmerizing scenery and an array of wildlife. However, nobody was expecting to find a badger, a creature infamous for its elusive and primarily nocturnal nature. Even more surprising is that this charming badger managed to put itself in a bit of a predicament, setting the stage for a rescue mission that would be anything but ordinary. The badger, unable to free itself, had found its way underneath an RSPCA van. It remains unclear how the animal wandered so far from its natural habitat, but it didn't take long for people to notice the unusual situation. As the word spread and the RSPCA arrived at the scene, they faced quite a challenge – how to free a badger seemingly determined to remain hidden under the vehicle. The intrepid RSPCA team remained undaunted. Working together, they managed to lift the RSPCA van and began the process of carefully freeing the badger. However, this crafty creature had other plans. No sooner had the badger been released from its initial predicament; it proceeded to dash across the area and hide under another vehicle – another van parked nearby. Onlookers were both amused and concerned for the badger. Its mischievous antics provided a touch of entertainment, but the animal's well-being remained a paramount concern. It was evident that it needed help, and the RSPCA team, displaying their unwavering commitment to rescuing animals in distress, sprang into action once more. After much effort, the determined team managed to catch the cheeky badger. Thanks to their dedication and professionalism, the animal was finally secured and could receive the care it needed. However, the badger's adventure will soon come to an end in a heartwarming conclusion. After receiving a thorough check-up and a few moments to recuperate, the badger will be released back into its natural habitat. The moral of the story? Even elusive creatures like badgers can find themselves in need of a helping hand every once in a while. The RSPCA's persistence and dedication to animal well-being must be celebrated. Thanks to their efforts, the cheeky badger will get a chance to resume its life in the wild, hopefully steering clear of any more misadventures involving vans. In conclusion, the captivating story of the cheeky badger at Saltdean cliffs is a testament to the compassion and hard work of the RSPCA. Furthermore, it serves as a reminder to us all that the world is full of both wonder and unpredictable moments. And who knows?

Samuel fills a glass cup with water and puts it in the freezer. He leaves the cup of water overnight and when he checks in the morning the cup has shattered. Confused he fills another cup with water and just leaves in on his kitchen counter. When he checks in the morning the glass is in tact.  Will the amount of space water takes up increase or decrease when frozen?  Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. Answer:","output":"The amount of space water takes up will increase when frozen. As mentioned in the hint, hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes. This expansion leads to a lower density in ice compared to liquid water, allowing ice to float on water. In Samuel's case, when he freezes the glass cup filled with water, the water expands as it turns into ice, causing an increase in the amount of space it takes up. The glass cup is unable to accommodate this expansion, which results in the cup shattering. When the water is left on the kitchen counter and remains in a liquid state, it does not expand, and the glass remains intact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And although the focus is on the All Blacks this weekend, a win in Hamilton would give the squad a significant lift before the main event. Team news Media playback is not supported on this device As expected, all six of the controversial call-ups are among the replacements as Gatland looks to protect as many of the Test 23 as possible. Elliot Daly and Liam Williams both start in the backline as they bid to sneak into the Test plans, with Daly well placed. Tour captain Sam Warburton isn't involved - which points to him facing the All Blacks - while Jonathan Joseph is another name conspicuous by its absence.

The news of Donald's recent engagement was broken by Lions boss Gatland in his pre-match news conference. Chiefs flanker Liam Messam gave his reaction to his team-mate's news: \\"It's about time he grew up.\\" Unlike the Saturday side, the Lions midweek team has flattered to deceive so far, beaten by the Blues and the Highlanders, and plenty of players on show in Hamilton will be desperate to do themselves justice for the first time on tour. With the Test series looming, both Gatland and the players insist the group is not about to split in half and a victory on Tuesday would go a long way to ensuring this remains the case. The Chiefs won the Super Rugby title in 2012 and 2013 - and are coached by the highly rated Glasgow-bound Dave Rennie - but are heavily denuded by All Blacks and Maori selection.

Migration and hibernation are examples of behaviors with annual cycles. Sleeping and waking are examples of behaviors with daily cycles.   Q: Migration and hibernation are examples of behaviors that occur on what temporal basis?   Choices:  - nocturnal  - weekly  - daily  - annual  A: Answer:","output":"Annual Based on the given paragraph, many animal behaviors occur in repeated cycles, with migration and hibernation being examples of behaviors with annual cycles. This means these behaviors occur once a year or have a one-year duration. The other choices - nocturnal, weekly, and daily - do not fit the description provided in the paragraph. Nocturnal refers to behaviors that take place during the night, while diurnal or daily behaviors occur during the day or have a 24-hour cycle, like sleeping and waking. Weekly behaviors, on the other hand, would be those that occur or repeat every week. In the context of the paragraph, migration and hibernation are not classified under any of these categories, but instead, they follow an annual temporal basis. Migration is the seasonal movement of animals from one region to another in search of resources, such as food, breeding sites, or suitable climate. It helps them adapt to changes in their environment and supports their survival. Hibernation is a period of inactivity and low metabolism that allows animals to conserve energy during extended periods of cold temperatures or food scarcity. During hibernation, animals reduce their metabolic rate, allowing them to survive on their stored body fat until the environment becomes more favorable. In conclusion, migration and hibernation are examples of behaviors that occur on an annual temporal basis to ensure survival and adaptation to changing environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHICAGO (AP) On Jan. l,an order went into effect requiring that every checked bag at more than 400 of the nation's commercial airports be screened for bombs and weapons.      Sunday was expected to the heaviest travel day since Jan. l. Yet spot checks on Sunday at several  of the nation's airports showed no major delays caused by the new security measures.     At the international terminal for Northwest Airlines at John F. Kennedy International Airport inprefix = st1 /New York, passengers waited up to 30 minutes longer than usual. Their bags were sent through giant screening machines and workers tore open taped boxes and searched through their contents before closing them up again.     Most travelers simply accepted stricter screening developed since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,2001,before which only 5 percent of the roughly 2 million bags checked each day were screened for bombs.      The U. S. government has put an additional 23,000 people into airports to carry out the new order.     Sonny Salgatar, a 23-year-old college student flying home to San Diego fromChicago, was told by an airport officer after the first pass that one of his bags was \\"hot\\", meaning there was something he couldn't identify and he wanted to open the bag for an inspection.     The \\"hot\\" item turned out to be Salgatar's clothing iron.     \\"Listen, anything they want to do for security is OK for me,\\" Salgatar said.

Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Now, I have a new situation: Two teams of researchers studied the environment in Antarctica.

This clearly falls within the research focus of Team Black, as they were specifically studying air pollution and its impact on the ozone layer. Team Red, on the other hand, was focused on studying the water in Antarctica. Their observations would likely be related to the effects of ozone depletion on aquatic ecosystems, such as the disruption of ocean food webs and the impact on plankton populations, which were mentioned in the background information.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? pick from the following. (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"(A). No. While the two questions you've asked are related, they aren't the same.  The first question, \\"How do I approach my parents about love?\\" is about the general concept of love and how to initiate a conversation about it with parents. This might refer to a young person looking to understand more about relationships, dating, and emotional feelings, and wanting parents to be the source of guidance and advice, or perhaps you want to discuss your feelings for someone in particular with your parents, asking their opinion or sharing the news. The second question, \\"How do I convince my parents for my love?\\" has deeper implications. This seems to relate to a situation where the parents may be objecting or not accepting of a person's chosen love partner or relationship. The objective is not just to talk about love, but to persuade parents to accept or support a chosen lover or relationship. In both cases, communication is crucial, but the strategies and sensitivities involved may vary. 1. Approach to discuss about love: - Start by finding a good time: Choose a quiet, relaxed time when your parents are open and available for a chat. - Be Respectful: Acknowledge their wisdom and experience. Let them know that you are asking because you respect their judgment. - Articulate your feelings: Use \\"I\\" statements to express your experience. Such as \\"I think I'm experiencing love... I feel...\\" - Be open to their viewpoints: They might have different perspectives, be prepared to listen to them patiently. 2. Convince parents for your chosen love: - Be Patient: This might not be a one-time conversation. Change typically takes some time. - Explain Reasonably: Elucidate why you like your partner, and what values you both share. - Show Responsibility: Prove that how the relationship is beneficial and you are serious about it. This will make them feel that the relationship is mature. - Seek Support: Sometimes, bringing in another trusted adult or family member can help. Remember, in both scenarios, maintaining open conversation is important. It may not always work out how you hope, but understanding each others views and feelings can make things easier.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave?, using the article: By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The palace that El Greco was obliged to leave belonged to Farnese.

Abstract: We examined the activity of defensins, cysteine-rich cationic peptides that are abundant in the cytoplasmic granules of human and rabbit granulocytes, against various tumor targets. The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Deadman 's Curve is a 1978 made for TV film based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence . Developed from a 1974 article published in the Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz , who also helped write the screenplay .  - The Synanon organization, initially a drug rehabilitation program, was founded by Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Dederich, Sr., (19131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California, United States. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\"   - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.  - Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvementeconomically, intellectually, or emotionallyoften with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Paul Morantz is an American attorney and investigative journalist.  He is known for taking legal cases alleging brainwashing by cults, self-help groups and for sexual misconduct by psychotherapists. He is considered an expert on these subjects. His successful prosecution of Synanon led to an attempt against his life, by means of a rattlesnake.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.    What is the relationship between 'deadman's curve' and 'television film'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Deadman's Curve' and 'television film' is that Deadman's Curve is a made-for-TV film that aired in 1978. A television film, also referred to as a TV movie, is a film produced specifically for airing on television channels, rather than being released in theaters. They are typically made with lower budgets compared to theatrical films and may have shorter running times.  In the case of Deadman's Curve, the film was based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence and was developed from a 1974 article published in Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz, who also helped write the screenplay. The film showcases the story of the musical duo and their rise to fame, while also delving into the trials and tribulations they faced throughout their careers. As a made-for-TV film, Deadman's Curve was able to reach a wide audience through television broadcasting, bringing the story of these musicians to life on the small screen for viewers to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of a rural, provincial, North Carolina backwater known only as Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate military. Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later rejoins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named...

Information:  - Jays are several species of medium-sized, usually colorful and noisy, passerine birds in the crow family, Corvidae. The names \\"jay\\" and \\"magpie\\" are somewhat interchangeable, and the evolutionary relationships are rather complex. For example, the Eurasian magpie seems more closely related to the Eurasian jay than to the Oriental blue and green magpies, whereas the blue jay is not closely related to either.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - Self-awareness is the capacity for introspection and the ability to recognize oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals. It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia. While consciousness is a term given to being aware of one's environment and body and lifestyle, self-awareness is the recognition of that awareness.  - Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In common English, they are known as the crow family, or, more technically, corvids. Over 120 species are described. The genus \\"Corvus\\", including the jackdaws, crows, and ravens, makes up over a third of the entire family.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Two species of chough (\\"\\") constitute the genus Pyrrhocorax of the Corvidae (crow) family of birds. These are the red-billed chough (\\"Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax\\"), and the Alpine chough (or Yellow-billed chough) (\\"Pyrrhocorax graculus\\"). The white-winged chough of Australia, despite its name, is not a true chough but rather a member of the family Corcoracidae and only distantly related.  - The Eurasian magpie or common magpie (\\"Pica pica\\") is a resident breeding bird throughout Europe, much of Asia and northwest Africa. It is one of several birds in the crow family designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of \\"monochrome\\" magpies. In Europe, \\"magpie\\" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (\\"Cyanopica cooki\\"), which is limited to the Iberian peninsula.  - The mirror test, sometimes called the mark test or the mirror self-recognition test (MSR), is a behavioural technique developed in 1970 by psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr. as an attempt to determine whether a non-human animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. The MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure self-awareness, however there has been controversy whether the test is a true indicator.  - A crow is a bird of the genus \\"Corvus\\". The term \\"crow\\" is used both as part of the common name of many species, and collectively for all of \\"Corvus\\".   - The treepies comprise four closely related genera (Dendrocitta, Crypsirina, Temnurus and Platysmurus) of long-tailed passerine birds in the family Corvidae. There are 11 species of treepie. Treepies are similar to magpies. Most treepies are black, white, gray or brown. They are found in Southeast Asia. They live in tropical forests. They are highly arboreal and rarely come to the ground to feed.  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.  - A raven is one of several larger-bodied species of the genus \\"Corvus\\". These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus.  - Magpies are birds of the Corvidae ( crow ) family , including the black and white Eurasian magpie , which is considered one of the most intelligent animals in the world , and the only non-mammal species able to recognize itself in a mirror test . In addition to other members of the genus Pica , corvids considered as magpies are in the genera Cissa , Cyanopica and Urocissa .  - The Holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining Wallace's Palearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia (with the exception of the southern Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent), and the Nearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North America north of Southern Mexico. These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm.  - The \\"Corvida\\" were one of two \\"parvorders\\" contained within the suborder Passeri, as proposed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the other being Passerida. Standard taxonomic practice would place them at the rank of infraorder.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'instance of'.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which liquid will have lower viscosity?  Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  Hint: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Answer:","output":"Liquid B will have a lower viscosity. This is because liquid B has weak intermolecular forces, which means its molecules can move more freely past each other compared to liquid A, which has strong intermolecular forces. When a liquid has lower intermolecular forces, it flows more easily and has a lower viscosity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kyle wanted to make a sarong for Kenneth, so","output":"once upon a time in a small, colorful village, there lived a boy named Kyle. He loved to create beautiful clothes for his friends and family, and one day he decided that he wanted to make a special gift for his best friend, Kenneth. A sarong! Now, a sarong is a long piece of cloth that can be wrapped around and tied at the waist, worn by both men and women. They can be very pretty and comfortable. Kyle wanted to make sure that the sarong he was creating for Kenneth was extra special. He set out on a journey to find the softest and most colorful fabric in the whole village. He went to the village market where people bought things, like food and clothes. There were many shops and stalls selling all sorts of beautiful fabrics, and Kyle looked at them all! Finally, he found the perfect one - it was soft and light, with a pattern of bright, happy colors that reminded him of a sunny day. With the fabric in hand, Kyle hurried back to his house. He knew that making a sarong takes time and patience, and he wanted to do it just right for his friend. Kyle carefully cut out a long rectangle shape from the fabric – this will become the main part of the sarong. Then, he hemmed the edges so the fabric wouldn't fray. Hemming is like put a thin border on the edges of the fabric, so it stays smooth and doesn't get messy. Next, Kyle sewed two long lines down the sides of the rectangle, where Kenneth's waist and legs would be when he wore the sarong. This made little tunnels that he could thread a cord through. The cord will help Kenneth tie the sarong around his waist. Kyle found a colorful cord that matched the fabric and threaded it through the tunnels. Finally, the sarong was complete! It was beautiful, soft, and it looked like it would be really comfy to wear. Kyle couldn't wait to give it to Kenneth. The next day, at school, he went up to Kenneth during recess, with the sarong hidden behind his back. When he surprised Kenneth with the gift, his friend's eyes lit up with joy. Kenneth loved his new sarong! He hugged Kyle tightly, and together, they ran to the playground, laughing and playing. Their friendship had grown even stronger with the lovely gift of the handmade sarong. And now, in the small, colorful village, everyone had seen the beautiful sarong Kyle had made, and many of them wanted something just as special for themselves. Kyle knew that he had found his purpose in life - to spread happiness by using his talent to create beautiful clothes. And, of course, to always cherish his best friend, Kenneth.

It is a fundamental principle found in various religious and philosophical texts around the world, promoting empathy and compassion. In the Bible, this concept is found in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. In the Gospel of Matthew, the Golden Rule is found in chapter 7, verse 12 (Matthew 7:12), which is part of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The verse reads as follows in the New International Version (NIV) translation: \\"So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.\\" Here, Jesus teaches that this principle of reciprocity encompasses the overall themes and messages of the Old Testament laws and prophetic teachings. In the Gospel of Luke, the Golden Rule is mentioned in chapter 6, verse 31 (Luke 6:31) during Jesus' Sermon on the Plain. The verse reads as follows in the New International Version (NIV) translation: \\"Do to others as you would have them do to you.\\" It is noteworthy that the Golden Rule transcends Christianity and can be found in different forms in various religions and philosophical systems around the world.

Option B is incorrect because, while it does mention skin irritation caused by fleas, it suddenly shifts the focus to feeding treats, which is unrelated to the topic.

This results in a higher volume of foot traffic and overall activity on Neil's street, which ultimately leads to an increased amount of litter and waste accumulating in the area. Step 1: Assess the problem - The first step to understanding this issue requires examining the key factors contributing to the accumulation of debris, such as the higher foot traffic and commercial activity present in Neil's street compared to Kyle's. Step 2: Identify the sources - The next step involves identifying possible sources of the litter and waste, including pedestrians, local businesses, and insufficient waste disposal systems. Step 3: Compare the streets - By comparing the different aspects of Neil's and Kyle's streets, such as the types of buildings, population density, and cleanliness standards, we can gain a better understanding of why Neil's street corner has more debris. Step 4: Evaluate the waste management system - To find potential solutions, it's important to examine the waste management system in place on both streets and see if there is an opportunity to improve it on Neil's street corner. Step 5: Propose possible improvements - Once the root cause of the problem is identified, we can propose tangible ways to minimize debris, such as increasing the number of trash receptacles, promoting responsible waste disposal among local businesses and residents, and enhancing street cleaning services. By following these systematic steps and critically assessing the contributing factors, we can identify the reasons behind the higher debris accumulation on Neil's street corner compared to Kyle's.

As such, racing enthusiasts can look forward to witnessing the thrilling action brought to life by the team and its drivers.

Q:Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere.

Summarize: As she studies her online calendar, she shows me how the hours and minutes of her day are dissected into colour-coded squares. \\"I've got my hands in many pies,\\" she says. In addition to being a television celebrity doctor, Ginni runs a busy medical practice as well as her own beauty-related business. She also serves on numerous boards, lectures at university, consults for large companies, and is a magazine columnist. And to top all that off, she's a mother to six children.  So I believe her when she says she rarely has time to eat lunch, let alone take a bathroom break. In between seeing her patients, Ginni tells me about how she became a celebrity doctor. Firstly, she says she didn't get to where she is today through meticulous planning. Her career has been shaped more by the changing needs of her family - and a lot of luck, she says. After finishing her medical degree in the late 1990s, Ginni promptly gave birth to her first child. \\"I was 24 years old with a baby and I was happy. Staying at home worked for me - for about six months. And then it didn't.\\" So Ginni got her general practice up and running in between having two more children. But she found it difficult to manage her family and full-time work - particularly with a practice that was so demanding. So another change was needed, she tells me. She went back to school, this time to study journalism. Her aim? To put her medical knowledge to use another way and to try and work from home. Ginni says she started small, writing up medical news stories for industry publications. She also worked in a methadone clinic at weekends to help a friend and boost her income. Things were working out a little more easily than they had been when she was working full-time, she says, but then her personal life took a turn for the worse. \\"I got divorced, and that was quite a big trauma in every way,\\" she says. \\"One big way that was unforeseen was that I needed to earn a lot of money and I wasn't going to earn that doing what I was doing.\\" \\"There was an ad in the paper for someone with media and medical experience... and it was to work for Joe Hockey [shadow minister for health and ageing at the time],\\" she says. \\"I was thinking, 'I've watched The West Wing, I can write, I'm a doctor, I can do this.'\\" When she rang to find out more, she was told the position wasn't really suitable for a mother and that it would be too intense. Yet she submitted her application nonetheless, and moved straight into politics. Ginni served as a political adviser to Mr Hockey for a year before moving swiftly into the world of publishing. Her first book, Why Am I So Tired?, sold about three copies, she says with a grin. One of those copies ended up on the desk of the editor for Women's Health magazine, just as that editor was looking for a doctor to join the magazine's staff. Soon after she signed on to Women's Health, the magazine was bought by Australia's Channel Seven media network - broadcasters of the popular Sunrise breakfast news programme. And that was the beginning of her career in television. She started getting requests to appear on the show, mostly to talk about women's issues. Over time, she solidified her role as a reliable TV doctor and someone the Australian public could relate to. But even with all of this experience under her belt, she says she didn't quite believe she was an authority on the business side of things - an area she thought she might like to move into next. \\"As a girl and as a young woman I would have told you I had no idea about money, no idea about business. But it turns out I'm actually pretty good at business. I actually have skills I didn't know I had.\\" So today, Ginni is putting those skills to work.  Four years ago, she and her current husband, Daniel Rubinstein, started Aurora Care, a private label anti-ageing skincare line. It was an idea that came about over wine and pizza, she says, and turning it into a fully fledged company was a steep learning curve. \\"I've seen so many small businesses run ahead of themselves since they've got all these great ideas and torch all of their cash flow,\\" she explains. \\"But we've been measured and very careful and managed to retain every aspect of our brand by making sure to never squeeze our cash flow.\\" And their business strategy seems to be working. This year, Ginni and David launched a retail line and expanded into China. \\"Today the business is going gangbusters and it's the thing I'm most passionate about,\\" Ginni says. As we wrap up, I ask Ginni about her recipe for success. She tells me it's simple. \\"I think you need to really believe in what you're doing. \\"If you love what you are doing, but more importantly, if you have retained your ethics and retained your dignity and principles, and you can hold your head high... your life is much easier.\\" Summary:","output":"Ginni, a television celebrity doctor, manages a busy medical practice, a beauty-related business, serves on numerous boards, lectures at university, consults for large companies, and writes as a magazine columnist, all while being a mother to six children. Her career path wasn't meticulously planned but shaped by her family's needs and good fortune. After completing her medical degree and having her first child, she started her general practice while having two more children. Later, she studied journalism to put her medical knowledge to use in writing and work from home. After experiencing a challenging divorce, she entered politics, eventually moving to the world of publishing and television. Ginni and her husband later started Aurora Care, a private label anti-ageing skincare line, which has since expanded into China. Her key to success is believing in what she's doing while maintaining her ethics, dignity, and principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What gender is the young hitchhiker? Movie title: The Straight Story Movie plot: Laurens, Iowa, 1994. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a 73-year-old frail old man who falls in his kitchen one day and waits for help from his slow-witted daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). She takes him to a doctor, from whom Alvin will heed no advice despite his many ailments (Alvin is a World War II veteran who is a diabetic and former alcoholic who continues to smoke cigars and is in the middle stages of emphysema). His only solution for his painful walking problems is to use two canes.One night during a raging thunderstorm, Alvin gets news informing him that his 75-year-old estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke. The next day on the phone with a relative, Rose says that Alvin and Lyle had a dispute ten years earlier and they have not spoken ever since.Determined to see his brother after all that time, Alvin decides to visit him. The trouble is that Lyle lives 370 miles away in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, and Alvin is legally unable to drive a car due to his bad health and poor eyesight. To make matters worse, Rose cannot drive either and no buses go to Mount Zion. Undaunted, Alvin hatches a plan: he will drive his Rehd lawn mower all the way.Alvin gathers some supplies, including a clapboard trailer that he hitches to the mower, and prepares for his long journey. Rose is worried about him, but the night before he departs, he tells her to look up into the sky at the stars.Some of Alvin's old friends warn him on the way out of town that his journey is foolhardy, but he continues on, moving a few miles an hour for only a few hours until his tractor breaks down outside town. He and his tractor get towed back home, where he promptly puts the Rehd rider out of its misery with a shotgun blast. Reunited with his daughter, Alvin's determination knows no bounds.

Rome bans eating in tourist areas ABOVE: This guy is totally breaking the law (Photo, Bonnie Bloge/Flickr.com) If the guys I play bocce with are any indication, eating and sitting around are two of Italy’s national pastimes — just don’t do it in Rome. A city which prizes it’s culinary culture and a laid-back way of life has banned eating at public monuments like the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and the Colosseum according to the New York Times: “[The] measure outlaws eating and drinking in areas of “particular historic, artistic, architectonic and cultural value” in Rome’s center, to better protect the city’s monuments, which include landmarks…Fines range all the way up to 650 for culinary recidivists.” Romans have probably noshed at the Spanish Steps since they were built in 1717 and at least one politician, Angelo Bonelli is leading the charge against the new ban: “Rome has passed any number of bans during the past five years, against prostitutes, homeless people and men taking their shirts off in parks to sunbathe, Mr. Bonelli noted, often to little effect. “You can’t govern with bans,” he said of Mayor Alemanno. “It’s a sign of his inability to control the city.” Many Romans agree. One recent Saturday, a few hundred protesters gathered in a flash mob on the steps leading to City Hall, chomping on pizza and panini as police officers registered the offenders. “Panino is not a crime,” one attendee wrote on his Facebook page.” Read the full story here.

At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's \\"Equivalents\\" series sold for 396,000, a single-lot record. Other works also have been exceeding price estimates.

We can simplify this expression by combining the constants 5706 and -2010: 22*g + (5706 - 2010) = 22*g + 3696 Now, our equation looks like this: 22*g + 3696 = 106*g Step 2: Isolate g We want to isolate g on one side of the equation, so we will subtract 22*g from both sides: 22*g - 22*g + 3696 = 106*g - 22*g This simplifies to: 3696 = 84*g Step 3: Solve for g Now, to find the value of g, we will divide both sides of the equation by 84: 3696 / 84 = 84*g / 84 44 = g So, the solution to the equation 22*g + 5706 - 2010 = 106*g is g = 44."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Minotaur Movie plot: Long ago in the Iron Age a shadow loomed over a lonely village of Thens. For every five years, eight village youths are stolen from their families to the capital of the Minos Empire and placed in the underground labyrinth to be a sacrifice to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice, is convinced that the beast is not a deity and that his love still lives within the labyrinth. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage and made his way in with seven other youths to be sacrifical lambs. However, Theo intends to kill the Minotaur. Along with his fellow captives, Tyro, Danu, Vena, Morna, Didi, Ziko and Cyrnan, they are placed in the labyrinth by King Deucalion, with the youths slaugthered one by one by the Minotaur. However, Theo is aided by Deucalion's sister, Queen Raphaella, who reveals that her mother gave herself to the most disturbing actions to create a living god, the Minotaur. As the Minotaur grows, so does its appetite when it murdered Deucalion's brother, resulting with the human sacrifices to appense the Minotaur while ensuring Minos's surival.Theo along the way discovers the labyrinth is connected to an underground vent and Tyro tempts the Minotaur to crash into one of the vents but is unsuccessful as the Minotaur eats him alive. Theo then tempts the Minotaur and in the process, the Minotaur breaks his left horn, but continues to charge after Theo. As Theo ran back towards the enlarged vent, he scratches the walls and generates a spark that ignites the whole labyrinth, and dives into a pond of water where Raphaella was waiting for him. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, but the beast is still alive and attempts to charge at them again. Theo takes the horn out of the rubble from where the vent was, and just as the beast attempts to kill him, stabs the Minotaur through the mouth and continues on charging until it hits a collapsed rock formation which impales the...

This implies they need to find a way to invest or save their money effectively. Step 2: Evaluate the options: We have five options - sidewalk, under the bed, street corner, city, and stockmarket. Step 3: Assess relevance of each option:  - Sidewalk: This option is not relevant because it does not provide any investment opportunities or savings growth. - Under the bed: This option, while a potential location to save money, does not help in growing the amount saved and poses risks such as theft or damage. - Street corner: This option is also not relevant, as it does not offer any investment or savings opportunities. - City: While the city might provide some possibilities for making investments through local businesses, it is not a specific or targeted enough option to address the individual's need to save for retirement. - Stockmarket: This option is relevant because it offers various investment opportunities that can potentially grow the individual's savings over time. Step 4: Choose the most suitable option: Among the given options, the stockmarket is the most suitable because it offers the most potential for growing one's savings, including through long-term investments and dividend-producing stocks.

To test how much dreams can help learning,Robert Stickgold had some students play a shapefitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep.Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes.Interestingly,the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most.Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream,many important tasks are getting done.The brain decides what to keep and what to forget.It is connecting new experiences to older learning.In fact,the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions  .At night,emotions are in the driver's seat.People who have had an upsetting experience often dream  about  it  afterward.Often  the  dream event  changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset.So if your best friend moves away,you might dream that you're the one who's moving.In fact,dreams have a proven power to improve mood,and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't. Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course   of your life,you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming.There's probably no single answer to the question why we dream,but there doesn't have to be.One dream might help you remember your math facts,while another might lead to a new invention,or give you a fun,crazy story to tell your friends.It's all in a night's work for our busy,mysterious brains.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Even if your parents are pretty busy, you might have a relative, coach, clergy member, friend's parent, or neighbor who can hang out. They can give you some time and positive attention, and maybe teach you some things that they are good at.  Building a relationship with someone other than your parents can help you develop interpersonal skills, and raise your self-esteem and self-confidence. Join a club or sports team in your school or community. This can help you find mentors and friends, and give you a feeling of belonging and accomplishment. Look for groups and activities that match well with your skills and interests.   For example, if you love to sing, you might join a youth choir at your school or a cultural center in your area. If you're more athletic, sign up a team sport like soccer or softball. You don't need to get attention only from your parents or other adults. Your friends and siblings will often be free and happy to hang out with you. Walk up to them, or pick up the phone, and ask if and when they are free to spend time with you.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Among the three choices, it is the second option that is most compatible with the given information. Apart from her personal interest in baking, there could be several other reasons why Robin opened a new bakery and baked cookies all day. Some of these reasons might include the following: 1. Passion for Baking: Robin might have discovered her passion for baking at an early age or developed the skill over time. Baking can be a form of self-expression for her and a way to create unique, delicious treats for others to enjoy. 2. Entrepreneurial Drive: Robin could be a budding entrepreneur looking to start her own business. Opening a bakery and baking cookies could be her way of pursuing her dream and putting her baking skills to practical, profitable use. 3. Economic Opportunity: There could be a significant demand for good, high-quality cookies in her community. Identifying this market gap, Robin would have taken it upon herself to meet this demand and carved out a niche in the local market. 4. Building Community Connections: By opening a new bakery and dedicating her time to baking cookies, Robin might be trying to establish connections within her community. A bakery serves as a meeting place for friends, family members, and neighbors, and Robin could be seeking ways to build and strengthen her own network of relationships. 5. Creative Outlet: Baking allows for experimentation and creation of new, original recipes. Robin could be someone who enjoys the artistic elements of baking and the opportunity to develop new, scrumptious cookies for customers to try. In conclusion, Robin's decision to bake cookies all day at her new bakery is most likely fueled by her love for baking, as well as several other potential factors such as her entrepreneurial spirit, the local market demand, a desire to connect with her community, and the need for a creative outlet. These reasons combined would drive Robin to spend her time doing what she loves and creating a successful bakery in the process."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"Where were Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana located in modern maps?\\"  Context: \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana were located in present-day Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.

Look for descriptive words or phrases that might indicate the reviewer's opinion. In this case, we find the words \\"never reach satisfying conclusions.\\" 3. Analyze the sentiment of these words or phrases. The phrase \\"never reach satisfying conclusions\\" implies that the character dramas did not meet the reviewer's expectations or were left unresolved in some way. 4. Determine the overall sentiment of the sentence. The negative language used to describe the character dramas suggests a negative view of the movie based on that aspect. Based on the analysis of the provided sentence, it can be concluded that the movie was seen negatively, at least with regards to the character dramas.

In my opinion though, the best, most extreme pieces of art come from way underground. If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. I have seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R.

When a NO BUDGET film like these two from Ron Atkins/John Giancaspro come out and blow all of the other \\"shock\\" films completely out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the whole Indy movie scene.

What is the answer?","output":"The Kentish Glory (Endromis versicolora) is a species of moth belonging to the family Endromidae. It is a visually striking creature known for the vibrant patterns on its wings and the subtle color variations within its markings. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, with a particular concentration in the UK's Kent region, which is the source of its name. Like many other moths, the Kentish Glory can mainly be found in habitats that include woodlands, forests, and heathlands. The adult Kentish Glory moth has a wingspan that ranges between 50-80mm. The most notable feature of this moth is the intricate and vibrant pattern on its wings. The forewings possess a unique blend of colors, consisting of whitish-gray, dark shades of brown, and hints of reddish-brown. These colors form both a zigzag pattern and a set of gradual bands that offer an additional dimension to the moth's striking appearance. Meanwhile, the hindwings showcase a more subdued color palette, appearing in a subdued grayish-brown hue. The adult stage is short-lived and usually lasts for about a week. During this time, the main goal of the Kentish Glory moth is to mate and lay eggs. The females release a pheromone to attract the males, which are typically slimmer and slightly more vibrant in color than their female counterparts. The life cycle of the Kentish Glory moth consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The eggs, which are laid in small clusters on the twigs of the host plant, take about 10-14 days to hatch. The larvae, upon hatching, will feed voraciously on the leaves of Birch trees for several weeks. As they grow and molt, the caterpillars change their appearance, transitioning from a black color to a vibrant green with contrasting white and black markings and yellow spots.  When the caterpillars have reached their final stage, which can last for about six weeks, they spin a cocoon to pupate. This process can take between three weeks and several months, depending on the specific conditions. Finally, the adult Kentish Glory emerges, marking the beginning of a new generation of these fascinating moths. The Kentish Glory has experienced a decline in population in certain areas, primarily due to habitat loss, deforestation, and fragmentation of their preferred wooded environments. Like many other species, the survival and continued success of the Kentish Glory moth depend largely on maintaining a sustained and coordinated effort to protect their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, “While agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does the author feel like a fresh arrival? Options: - not enough information - Because of Italian food. - Because they live in Italy. - Because of the burst of spring produce.

Context: Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.

Article: We know, painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away, and antibiotic from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. Can medicine come in chicken eggs? A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside.  These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients  in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs.  Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.  Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis.  The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs.  These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the passage?

Information:  - In modern beekeeping, a Langstroth hive is any vertically modular bee hive that accepts frames that are locally referred to as \\"Langstroth\\" frames. The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920.  - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans.  - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter .  - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.  - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement.  - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection....  - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\".  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany.  - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction.  - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery.  - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.  - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms.   - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora.  - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology.  - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee.  - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.    'honey super' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'field of work'?

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.

It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.

UPDATED:. 18:08 EST, 31 January 2013. He was the art world’s king of bling – a man who devoted a lifetime to acquiring some of the most exceptional and bizarre works of gold and silver ever produced. Many of the items London dealer Michael Wellby bought were once so underrated they would have sold for little more than their value in precious metal. But times change. And yesterday historians were celebrating his gift to a museum of one of the most important collections of Renaissance and Baroque objects for more than a century. Precious: A group of German silver gilt cups of a stag by Elias Zorer (c.1605-10), an owl (c.1570), a ship model (c. 1620), a Dutch musketeer by Adriaen de Grebbe (c. 1600) and a bear (c. 1605-10) Director of the Ashmolean Museum Dr Christopher Brown (right) and Professor Timothy Wilson, The Keeper of the Ashmolean's Department of Western Art, discuss a silver gilt pitcher. His haul of nearly 500 items, valued together in the tens of millions, has been bequeathed to Oxford University’s Ashmolean museum. Among them are highly unusual works that were considered inferior or undesirable at the time he bought them, compared to more traditional or sought-after pieces. This month the spoils of his shrewd eye and travels around the continent will go on display before being housed in a permanent gallery, described as ‘a cabinet of wonders’. The collection, bequeathed after Mr Wellby’s death last year, was trumpeted as ‘the most important accession of objects of this sort to any UK museum’ since a bequest by Ferdinand Rothschild to the British Museum in 1898. Important donation: A German Serpentine ewer and basin with silver gilt mounts (c.1580) The blues: A lapis lazuli cup (pictured left) with jewelled and enamelled silver gilt mounts made with stone (c. 1560) and a bowl (right) with gold mounts from Prague (c. 1608) Admiration: A woman looks at a 'silver gilt ewer with enamelled royal arms of Portugal' that dates from around 1510 AD. Impressive: The collection of nearly 500 objects has been valued at tens of millions of pounds. Historically it spans more than 250. years from the 1500s to 1700s. Aesthetically, however, it encompasses a. fascinating spectrum of style and craftsmanship, including works that. incorporate coconut shell, ostrich egg, ivory and mother of pearl. Such. items have come to be highly prized by wealthy collectors – but few of. his contemporaries appear to have had Mr Wellby’s unerring nose for a. bargain. According to. one friend, he was expert in securing under-priced items – but, the. friend added: ‘He bought a great many things simply because he liked. them, not because they were sought-after or fashionable.’ Mr. Wellby, who died aged 84, was driven by a passion for craftsmanship. He. joined the family silver-dealing business at 18 and built it into one. of the best known in Europe, with premises in Mayfair. His. private collection, acquired during more than six decades of travel and. trade, also reflected his fascination for exotic materials, especially. from the Africa and the East. Generous: The haul of objects was donated by the late antiques collector Michael Wellby. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (pictured) had 900,000 visitors last year and announced plans for a series of exhibitions to celebrate its 330th anniversary this year. Highlights:","output":"1.

Why do Steven Spielberg’s movies often deal with the divorce of parents or an absent father such as in E.T., Catch Me If You Can and Jurassic Park? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose from:  +no;  +yes;","output":"+no; Frank Abagnale Jr.'s reaction to the movie \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" by Steven Spielberg: Frank Abagnale Jr. was reportedly pleased with the movie \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" directed by Steven Spielberg. The film, released in 2002, is based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., a former con artist and forger who impersonated various professionals, such as a pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor, before being captured and serving time in prison. Abagnale later reformed, became a consultant and expert on fraud prevention, and helped the FBI with their investigations. Abagnale has stated in interviews that he was involved in the development of the film, working closely with the screenwriter, Jeff Nathanson, to accurately portray his life story. He has also expressed his admiration for Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of him in the movie, stating that the actor did a great job capturing the essence of his character. With regards to the accuracy of the film, Abagnale has confirmed that Spielberg was interested in sticking to the truth as much as possible, with some creative liberties taken for dramatic purposes. Although certain aspects of the story were altered or embellished, overall, the movie effectively portrays the main events of Abagnale's life. Therefore, Frank Abagnale Jr. was generally satisfied with the film's portrayal of his life and experiences. Why Steven Spielberg’s movies often deal with the divorce of parents or an absent father such as in E.T., Catch Me If You Can, and Jurassic Park: Steven Spielberg is known for exploring themes of parental divorce or absent fathers in many of his films. This pattern can be traced back to the filmmaker's own childhood experiences. Spielberg's parents divorced when he was a teenager, and this event deeply affected him. His father, Arnold Spielberg, was often away from home due to work commitments, which resulted in a strained relationship between them. As a result, Spielberg uses his films as a means of expressing the emotional impact of these experiences. In movies like \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" and \\"Jurassic Park,\\" the themes of separation and father figures serve as a recurring motif that reflects Spielberg's own struggles with paternal relationships. By exploring these topics, Spielberg creates a sense of empathy and understanding, allowing audiences to connect with his characters and the situations they face. In conclusion, the two questions asked have different meanings. The first question relates to the real-life Frank Abagnale Jr.'s reaction to his portrayal in the movie \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" while the second pertains to the themes of parental divorce and absent fathers in Steven Spielberg's movies, which are reflective of the director's own childhood experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully.

Summarize the following: For your weave, you’ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well. Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid.  Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other. Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids. When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid.  The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time. Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot. Summary:","output":"To complete a weave, gather essentials such as two packages of human hair wefts, curved sewing needles, matching weave thread, a wig cap, a comb, and shears.

Process:  - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose companies are required to clean after the mess they do happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process. If companies are required to clean up after the pollution they cause, this will lead to several positive outcomes in reducing the damage caused by acid rain. Direct effects: 1. Companies would need to invest in technologies and implement practices to reduce the emission of harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen. This would lead to a lower concentration of these substances being released into the air, directly impacting the formation of acid rain. 2. With improved pollution control measures in place, the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen released into the atmosphere would be reduced, and as a result, there would be less acid rain formed. Indirect effects: 1. Stricter regulations for companies regarding pollution cleanup would likely increase public awareness of the issue and encourage more sustainable industrial practices. This could potentially lead to a change in the overall approach to pollution by industries, reducing the damage caused by emissions and other pollutants in general. 2. Implementing strict pollution-control practices can also potentially create an incentive for companies to develop innovative solutions and more environmentally friendly methods, thus reducing the overall environmental impact and damage caused by acid rain. In summary, the perturbation of requiring companies to clean up the pollution they cause would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain formation and the resulting environmental damage. By reducing the emissions of harmful substances and promoting sustainable practices, this requirement would contribute to less damage caused by acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. According to the above context, answer the following question. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? Answer:","output":"The author suggests using the right type of ricotta when making Tuscan gnudi. The \\"proper\\" ricotta should be the kind that was made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, and has a firm structure. It should not be the grainy, yogurt-like consistency ricotta found in supermarket tubs, which often contains unnecessary gums or additives. Using the proper ricotta will help prevent the gnudi from dissolving in the simmering water during cooking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the three options provided, the one that best answers the question, \\"Why did Remy do this?\\" is: C: Learn new information This choice accurately reflects Remy's intention to seek guidance and understanding in his new role. Carrying papers to work demonstrates his commitment to addressing his questions and ensuring he is well-equipped with the knowledge needed to perform his job efficiently. Option A, \\"steal information and put it on the papers,\\" is unlikely as it suggests malicious intent rather than a genuine desire to learn. Additionally, there is no information in the context provided to indicate any dishonesty on Remy's part. Therefore, it is not the best answer. Option B, \\"annoy his superiors,\\" is also not appropriate as it misrepresents the context.

After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation.

The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health.

Immediately prior to the Holocaust, the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million. Statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi Jews, oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million. Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74% of Jews worldwide. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The highest total number of Jews in the world at any time can be traced back to the period immediately before the Holocaust. As mentioned in the context, the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million during that time. This figure includes diverse Jewish populations, such as Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jews. In the 11th century, Ashkenazi Jews only made up three percent of the global Jewish population. However, by 1931, they accounted for 92 percent of the world's Jewish population. This growth and dominance showcase how the Ashkenazi Jewish community expanded over time.  Just before the Holocaust, Ashkenazi Jews constituted a significant part of the global Jewish population, contributing to the 16.7 million Jews worldwide. Unfortunately, the Holocaust led to the tragic death of around 6 million Jews, many of whom were Ashkenazi. This profoundly impacted the Jewish population and reshaped global Jewish demography. Today, the number of Ashkenazi Jews is estimated to be between 10 million and 11.2 million. According to Sergio DellaPergola's rough calculation, they comprise less than 74% of the global Jewish population. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews at about 75% of Jews worldwide. Based on these statistics, we can conclude that the highest total number of Jews in the world at any given time was around 16.7 million, just before the Holocaust in the early 20th century. This number encompassed various Jewish communities, with Ashkenazi Jews forming the largest percentage of the Jewish population at that time. Since then, the number has never reached that peak, but various estimates indicate there are currently around 14.7 million to 15 million Jews worldwide, with Ashkenazi Jews still constituting a significant portion of the global Jewish community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two stand out performances came from the Anti-Christ and the older guy (sorry, can't remember their names) In watching the \\"making of\\" (to answer my question of \\"what were they thinking???\\"), the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying \\"we're gonna reach wide audiences\\" and \\"brad Johnson is amazing\\" and \\"this is just like a Hollywood movie\\". I came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the \\"heck\\" they are doing. I commend the effort. Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium possible to do that. Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Katy is the only daughter of a rancher who hopes to take over the family ranch someday. Her father however hopes that her older brother Howard will take over the running of the ranch. After failing to complete an essay for her high school exam Katy returns home for the holidays to face her father's disapproval. Her redemption comes in the form of a black Mustang filly which Katy encounters after a close call with a mountain lion, Katy sets out to capture this Mustang who she names Flicka in an effort to prove to her father that she is capable of assuming the responsabilities of running the ranch. Katy's father does not approve of her actions however and after Katy deliberately disobeys him by training and riding Flicka behind his back Flicka is sold to the rodeo for use in the wild horse race. Katy succeeds in rescuing her beloved horse with the assistance of her brother by posing as a man and entering the race, she then takes Flicka and rides towards home. Another encounter with the mountain lion on the way back to the ranch results in Flicka being critically injured and Katy becoming seriously ill after being caught in a major storm. Her family find her and take her home while her father returns to put Flicka down due to the seriousness of her injuries. Katy hears a gunshot whilst she is battling the fever and assumes Flicka has been killed. A few days later Katy's fever breaks however she is depressed at her horses death. Katy's father calls her downstairs and into the yard where Katy discovers that Flicka is alive and well, the shot she had heard was aimed at the mountain lion. The film ends with Katy and Flicka riding together through the Wyoming mountains. Answer:","output":"How does the plot of the movie reflect Katie's journey to self-assertion and her struggle to gain her father's approval in the male-dominated field of ranching? The movie revolves around the story of Katie, the only daughter of a rancher family who wishes to take over the family ranch someday. There is an apparent gender and preference bias as her father wishes to pass the reins of the ranch to her older brother, Howard. This setting not only underscores the predominantly male environment in ranching but also sets the stage for Katie's journey towards self-assertion and her struggle for approval and acceptance from her father. Upon the commencement of the movie, Katie is shown to be grappling with her academic obligations. She fails to complete an essay for her high school exam and then returns home for the holidays. Here, she faces the disapproval of her father. This incidence underscores her initial struggle in dealing with her personal aspirations that do not conform to expected societal, in this case, familial norms. Her redemption comes through her relationship with a black Mustang filly, Flicka, whom she encounters after a close call with a mountain lion. Katie reveals both her courage and determination in an attempt to capture and tame Flicka. This act presents a turning point in her journey, where Katie stakes her claim on her aspirations and showcases her ability and willingness to fortitude and self-reliance. However, her path is not devoid of challenges. Despite her successful efforts, her father disapproves of her actions. This event further fuels the narrative of Katie's struggle for acceptance in a world governed by patriarchal norms. Katie's determination is unyielding, and she defies her father by training and riding Flicka surreptitiously. The filmmakers offer another challenge to Katie when Flicka is sold off to the rodeo for use in the wild horse race. Katie rises to this challenge by rescuing her beloved horse, taking on the disguise of a man, to compete in the race. This act not only underscores the gender bias she encounters but also demonstrates her willingness to overcome societal limitations. Despite winning Flicka back, their journey remains fraught with danger and critical injuries from a mountain lion and severe weather conditions. Overcoming grave illness and dealing with the emotional blow of potentially losing Flicka, Katie's strength is put to the ultimate test. The climax of the narrative provides a moment of relief as well as triumph. Confronted with the seeming death of Flicka, Katie faced with heartbreak assumes Flicka's death. To her surprise, Flicka later returns, alive and well, with killing off of the predator mountain lion by her father. The film ends on a note of acceptance and triumph for Katie as she rides with Flicka through the Wyoming mountains. Through this journey, she not only proves her capability in running the ranch but also breaks through the gender norms dominating her world."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? Answer: Answer:","output":"People who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods frequently, as many calorie-dense foods are highly processed and contain high levels of salt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the most important things you can do to keep your feet from sweating is to wash them thoroughly every day. This will help to minimize any bacteria or fungi that might be living in the damp environment of your socks. Use antibacterial soap each time you wash your feet.  Even if you don’t shower every day, you should wash your feet with soap and warm water on a daily basis. Bacteria and fungi thrive in warm, damp settings, so inside your socks and around your feet are perfect places for them to grow. Be sure to dry your feet completely before putting shoes or socks on. Any time your feet get wet, they need to be thoroughly dried before being confined to shoes and/or socks again. This will also help minimize the potential for bacteria growth. You may even want to use a hairdryer on your feet to make sure they are super dry. Antiperspirant deodorant can be applied to other parts of the body too, not just to underarms. If your feet are sweating a lot, try spraying some deodorant on the soles of your feet before you put your socks on.  Make sure you use the antiperspirant type of deodorant for the best results. Look for the active ingredients aluminum zirconium (trichlorohydrex) or aluminum chloride (hexahydrate). You can start by applying the same kind of deodorant you use on your underarms to your feet. But if this seems to have minimal effect, you may need to ask your doctor about prescription strength deodorant. Purchase a spray antiperspirant deodorant for your feet.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation 16*p + 1386 = -6*p + 1034 for p, follow these steps: Step 1: Move all terms containing the variable 'p' to one side of the equation. Start by adding 6*p to both sides of the equation. This will move the -6*p from the right side to the left side. 16*p + 6*p + 1386 = -6*p + 6*p + 1034 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. Combine the terms on the left side: 16*p + 6*p = 22*p Now rewrite the equation: 22*p + 1386 = 1034 Step 3: Isolate the variable 'p' on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 1386 from both sides of the equation. 22*p + 1386 - 1386 = 1034 - 1386 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. 22*p = -352 Step 5: Solve for 'p'. To find the value of 'p', divide both sides of the equation by 22: 22*p / 22 = -352 / 22 This simplifies to: p = -16 Therefore, the solution to the equation 16*p + 1386 = -6*p + 1034 is p = -16."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Then, when the sun is setting, make sure to lock them up in their coop for the night. When locking the chickens up, make sure to count them so they’re all in the coop.  Chickens will learn that their coop is home, and eventually settle inside the coop every night when it is time to go in. This will save you the trouble of rounding the chickens up. However, if you’re still having some trouble getting the chickens inside of their coop, throw some treats inside. The chickens should have access to their coop at all times during the day, but the coop should stay locked during the night. Chickens will come in and out of their coop to lay eggs, eat and drink (if the feeder and drinker is in the coop), and get away from the heat or the cold. Happy hens will, on average, lay 1 egg apiece every day. You should collect the eggs every morning or afternoon to make sure you are receiving a fresh supply. During the heat of summer, you should collect the eggs twice a day. You should collect the eggs in a basket, box or some sort of container. If you drop an egg, make sure to clean up the mess! daily. Cleaning your chickens’ coop is very important, as it prevents pests (such as mites) and diseases. The chickens’ bedding must be replaced daily, and you must also clean the whole chicken coop from time to time—weekly, for instance. The more chickens you have, the more often you’ll need to fully clean the coop. Put on some gloves and a mask and dispose of all the bedding, sweep the floor of the housing, hose the housing down, clean out the nest boxes, rinse the feeders and drinkers, and clean the perches. Do your daily routine and feed them, refill their drinker, collect eggs, etc. Then observe them and see if there is a change in appearance or behavior to make sure the chickens are healthy.  Panting, cloudy eyes, sluggishness, low alertness, huddling, bald spots, a reduction in egg production, and decreased eating or drinking are all potential signs of illnesses. If you come across any of these, you should contact your vet. If one of your chickens has a bleeding wound, separate it immediately to stop the other chickens from pecking at the wound. Isolate the chicken until healed, and then return it back to its coop. Dust bathing is a way your chickens clean themselves, and it also prevents parasites such as mites or lice from infesting your chickens. If your chickens are free-range, they might have access to sufficient dirt already. if necessary. If you’re preparing your chickens for a show, or if they’re just very dirty at the time, consider bathing them. While you’re at it, clean the coop as well! Grab a big enough tub, a mild soap, and a cup or sponge. While you're bathing them you might also trim their beaks and nails, and clip their wings too. Summary:","output":"In the morning, open the chicken coop so the chickens can go outside and play. At sunset, close the coop and count the chickens to make sure they're all safe inside. If they don't want to go in, give them treats in the coop. Chickens need to go in and out of their coop during the day to lay eggs, eat, and hide from hot or cold weather. Collect their eggs every day, sometimes even twice a day, to have fresh ones. Cleaning the coop is important to keep chickens healthy and away from bugs. Change their bedding every day and clean the whole coop sometimes, like once a week. Watch the chickens to see if they look or act sick, and call the vet if they do.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same essential information but present it in slightly different ways. Both statements mention that the person named Charles joined Bishop Guerin on September 22, 1904, and returned to Béni Abbès on January 24, 1905. The main differences between the two sentences are the arrangement of the information and some minor variations in wording. In the first sentence, the focus is placed on the dates and the events associated with those dates. It begins by mentioning the date on which Charles joined Bishop Guerin, followed by the date he returned to Béni Abbès. The use of numbers for the dates also provides this sentence with a more precise and formal tone. The joining of the two events with \\"and\\" serves to demonstrate direct connection between Charles's actions and the two events. The second sentence, while containing the same basic information, rearranges the order of that information. It starts by naming Charles and saying that he joined Bishop Guerin on a specific date. This is followed by his return to Béni Abbès on another date. The structure of this sentence puts more emphasis on Charles's actions and the events, rather than the dates. The use of written-out months, as opposed to numerals, gives this sentence a somewhat more relaxed and conversational tone.

Charlie decided to quit smoking so he threw away his carton but not his lighter because the","output":"lighter had sentimental value. It was gifted to him by his late grandfather - a constant reminder of the bond they once shared. Despite the urge to smoke, Charlie knew that he wanted to honor his grandfather's legacy by living a healthy life.  Step 1: Acknowledging the urge to quit smoking - Charlie acknowledges the need to quit smoking for his health and as a tribute to his grandfather's memory. This step is essential as it allows Charlie to mentally prepare for quitting. Step 2: Discarding the carton - By throwing away the carton of cigarettes, Charlie solidifies his commitment to quitting. This action helps to reduce temptation and is a positive step towards breaking the habit. Step 3: Holding onto the lighter - Charlie keeps the lighter as a reminder of his grandfather and their connection. This decision serves as motivation to quit smoking and to preserve the memory of his grandfather. As Charlie continued with his journey to quit smoking, he realized that he needed a plan to cope with cravings and avoid potential triggers. Step 4: Identifying triggers and forming a strategy - Charlie makes a list of situations or cues that might trigger his desire to smoke, such as stress, social gatherings, or after meals. For each trigger, he comes up with a strategy to cope with the craving, such as chewing gum or going for a walk. Step 5: Finding support - Charlie knew the journey would be challenging, so he decided to join a quit smoking support group. Sharing his experience with others going through similar struggles would provide encouragement and help keep him accountable. Step 6: Adopting a healthy lifestyle - Giving up smoking would require lifestyle changes to stay smoke-free. Charlie started exercising regularly, eating well, and ensuring he got enough sleep. Focusing on living a healthy lifestyle would keep his mind occupied and minimize the desire to smoke. Step 7: Rewarding progress - Charlie celebrated his milestones – be it days, weeks, or months without smoking – by treating himself to something special. These small rewards boosted his motivation and provided a sense of accomplishment. As Charlie progressed through these steps, he gradually became more confident in his ability to quit smoking. Each passing day, he felt healthier and more committed to his new smoke-free life. He stuck to the plan, cherishing the lighter as a reminder of his grandfather and the lifelong bond they shared. And so, even though the road ahead was full of challenges, Charlie knew he was on the right path – a path towards a healthier, happier future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots? Answer: A:","output":"The threat of robots can be avoided if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. The author emphasizes that robots are dangerous only if programmers are careless and fail to do sufficient testing, which might result in a system that breaks human taboos. By programming robots with human values and ethical rules, they could be beneficial to humanity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Of course, you save time by reading fast, but this is not the main reason for fast reading. The main reason is that you understand better what you are reading when you read fast. As your eyes move along the line of point, they make fixations   or pauses  . It is important that you see several words at a fixation. It is also important that your eyes leave a group. The numbers of letters or words that you see at a fixation are called your eye span  . Pay more attention to improving your rate of reading. With practice you can learn to read faster than you usually read. The way in which you read always depends on   what you are reading and for what purpose. You should know the different ways of reading so that you can apply whatever method is necessary. Here are four ways of reading: (1) Skimming is an important kind of reading. This method can be used when you wish to review something that you have forgotten. You can skim to get the main points.

Premise: \\"The ideal, Prudie thinks, is choosing a gift with some real thought behind it that does not break the bank.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The perfect gift should be the most expensive one as well.\\" Step 1: Identify the key concepts of the premise - Ideal gift - Real thought behind it - Does not break the bank Step 2: Identify the key concepts of the hypothesis - Perfect gift - Most expensive one Step 3: Compare the key concepts of the premise and hypothesis - The premise focuses on the thoughtfulness behind the gift and affordability, while the hypothesis focuses on the price of the gift, stating it should be the most expensive one. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis - The premise focuses on choosing a thoughtful gift that is affordable, suggesting that the cost of the gift is not the most important factor in determining the ideal gift. In contrast, the hypothesis states that the perfect gift should be the most expensive one, placing more importance on the price of the gift. Justification: Based on the analysis of the premise and hypothesis, it seems that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

The price of an oil change was too expensive. Anything over 100.00 for a 4cylinder is just stupid. Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is clearly negative. The customer expressed dissatisfaction and frustration on several fronts:  1. The service issue: The customer claims that workers did not reinstall the cabin air filter, which reflects negatively on the perceived competence and professionalism of the service staff. This absence of the air filter could potentially result in poor air quality inside the vehicle or may even damage the climate control system over time. Having to return to the facility for correction of this oversight would understandably cause inconvenience. 2. The blame game: Upon returning, the customer observed the staff pointing fingers at each other instead of accepting responsibility and effectively resolving the issue. This type of behavior is often viewed as unprofessional and brings into question the general work ethic and customer service quality of the establishment. 3. Overpricing: The final complaint refers to the cost of the oil change. The reviewer mentioned a price of over 100, describing it as \\"stupid\\" for a 4-cylinder vehicle. While the price of an oil change can vary based on the type of oil used (conventional, synthetic, or synthetic blend), the idea that the user considered this price point to be unreasonable indicates a perception of being overcharged.  All these factors contribute to the conclusion that this is a negative review. The tone is critical, the customer's expectations were not met, and there seems to be a lack of trust in the competency and integrity of the service provider. A great review often contains praise and recommendation for others to patronize the entity being reviewed. However, the components of this review do not encourage, but rather dissuade others from using the same service. Therefore, it can be concluded unequivocally that this is a negative review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees \\"for humanitarian reasons\\" and because of the \\"special relationship\\" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, \\"We're still involved in ongoing discussions.\\" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well.

Casey accidentally hit Riley in the face with a bat: This is an unfortunate and painful event for Riley, which would understandably cause concern and distress among others who are witnessing or hearing about it. 2.
