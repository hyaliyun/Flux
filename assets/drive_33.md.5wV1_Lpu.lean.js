The numbers for Italian American descent and French American descent are 1,694 and 1,064 respectively. To figure out the difference, we first need to combine the numbers for people of Italian and French descent. When we add 1,694 (Italian American descent) and 1,064 (French American descent), we get a total of 2,758. Then, to find out how many more people claimed American ancestry in comparison to those of Italian American and French American descent combined, we subtract this total from the number of people who claimed American ancestry. Subtracting 2,758 (Italian and French descent combined) from 23,875 (American ancestry) we get: 23,875 - 2,758 = 21,117 So, there are 21,117 more people in San Juan who were of American ancestry compared to those claiming either French American or Italian American descent."},{"instruction":"Article: Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone.

Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves.

You need to create a new output list by performing certain operations on each element in the input list. 3. Check if the integer is even or odd: a. If it is even (including 0), divide the number by 4. b. If it is odd, multiply the number by 4 and then add 2. 4. Keep the decimal values in the output list; do not round them. 5. The output list should contain the resulting transformed numbers in the same order as the input list. Steps to find the answer: 1. Start with an empty output list: [] 2. Loop through each element in the input list: [52, -84, -13, 31, 27, 63, -6, -3, 21, -97, 94] Example for the first few elements: a. For 52 (even), divide by 4 => 52 / 4 = 13.0 b. For -84 (even), divide by 4 => -84 / 4 = -21.0 c. For -13 (odd), multiply by 4 and add 2 => (-13 * 4) + 2 = -50 d. For 31 (odd), multiply by 4 and add 2 => (31 * 4) + 2 = 126 3. Append the results of each operation to the output list. 4. The final output list should look like: [13.0, -21.0, -50, 126, ..., (and so on for other elements)] Thus, follow this process for every element in the input list, and the result will be a transformed list based on the given guidelines."},{"instruction":"Question: I have a new situation: India decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, and Nepal decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity. But I can use this background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. What is an answer for this question: Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, India, which decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, had more of an impact on the carbon cycle than Nepal, which chose to rely on renewable hydro power. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, release significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere when they are burned. This process disrupts the natural carbon cycle, as there is now more CO2 entering the atmosphere than is being removed through processes such as photosynthesis. This imbalance results in an increase in greenhouse gas concentration, contributing to global warming and climate change. On the other hand, Nepal's decision to use hydro power means they are generating electricity using a renewable and more environmentally-friendly source. This method harnesses the power of water flowing through turbines to produce electricity, without producing CO2 emissions. Thus, their impact on the carbon cycle is much smaller compared to India's choice to use fossil fuels. In conclusion, India's decision to use fossil fuels for electricity production had a more significant impact on the carbon cycle compared to Nepal's reliance on hydro power."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Her father Washoe Smith, whose briefly productive mining claim was both the source of the town's name and the reason for its existence, is now known among the people as the town drunk. M'Liss has to take care of him and works in a saloon washing glasses. They lose their home when Mayor Morpher demands it as the location of the new school. New school master Stephen Thorne encourages M'Liss to leave the saloon and go to school. Her father is shot and killed intervening in a saloon brawl. The now orphaned M'Liss is left in the guardianship of her father's friends, gambler Lou Ellis and the town barber Alf Edwards. When the mayor's wife Delia disapproves of M'Liss and tries to have her placed in an orphanage, M'Liss decides to leave Smith's Pocket. Stephen kisses M'Liss to persuade her not to run away. Told that a kiss is tantamount to a proposal of marriage, M'Liss is confused about what marriage is and asks for advice from heart-of-gold saloon girl Rose. The Morphers' ne'er-do-well city cousin, Jack Farlan, drunkenly tries to take advantage of M'Liss but is rescued by Stephen.

The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Article: It's true that many dads in the wild aren't interested in parenting, but there are some that work pretty hard to give their little ones a good start. Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches. For about 62 to 67 days, the egg stays on top of the father's feet, in very cold temperatures that drop down to -39deg C. As a result, the father may lose nearly 50 percent of his body weight while waiting for his baby penguin to be born! Question: What is the best title for the text?

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

Scotland Yard has received 27 allegations of ritual child abuse this year alone - a dramatic increase on a decade ago, when just two such cases were reported to police in the whole of 2004. Examples of the faith-based abuse include a child being dunked in a bath to 'wash away evil spirits', children being raped, and a pastor swinging a child around banging its head to 'drive out the devil'. Now teachers, social workers and doctors are to be taught to spot the signs of the abuse in a drive to tackle the growing problem across Britain. Police say witchcraft-based child abuse is on the rise - this shows an alleged exorcism ceremony in a suburban street in south London last month. Last month police were called to a leisure centre in south London after residents reported a string of dawn 'child exorcisms' in which adults surrounded a toddler chanting 'Get the demon out'. A number of child killings have been linked to these beliefs, including the murder of Kristy Bamu, 15, who was tortured and drowned by his sister and her boyfriend in 2010; and the death of Victoria Climbie. The number of cases of ritualistic or faith-based abuse of children reported to Scotland Yard has increased year-on-year over the past decade. But detectives believe the number of reports is just the tip of the iceberg, with many more such cases being kept secret among communities. Police and child protection experts have now created a training film for all front-line professionals who work with children to teach them how to recognise the signs that a child may be suffering, or likely to suffer harm from witchcraft. The DVD will be launched at a conference on the subject in London today, organised by the Met police and the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service (CCPAS), before being distributed to those in the force area who work with children who may be affected. Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Met's Project Violet which tackles faith-based child abuse, said: 'Abuse linked to belief is a horrific crime which is condemned by people of all cultures, communities and faiths. 'Families or carers genuinely believe that the victim has been completely taken over by the devil or an evil spirit, which is often supported by someone who within the community has portrayed themselves as an authority on faith and belief.' This alleged exorcism ceremony, performed on the street in south London, did not involve children but police say child abuse linked to faith-based rituals is on the rise and professionals must learn to recognise the signs. 'But regardless of the beliefs of the abusers, child abuse is child abuse and it is important that professional are clear about the signs to look for.' At the event at City Hall, detectives will debate with teachers, social workers and healthcare professionals to discuss how to tackle what is now a growing problem in Britain. In 2004 just two such cases were reported to Scotland Yard. By 2009 it had risen to seven, and by 2012 it had risen again to 19. Among this year's 27 reports of such abuse, cases included a child forced to drink unknown substances to 'rid them of evil spirits' and parents removing their children from school and taking them abroad to attend an 'exorcism' ceremony. One case has already resulted in an arrest for rape, and another in a charge of rape being brought. Previous cases dealt with by Scotland Yard include a child having chillies rubbed into its eyes to 'remove an evil spirit' and being cut with a knife for the same reason. Extreme cases have seen children killed as a result of these rituals. In 2000 Victoria Climbié, an eight year old originally from the Côte d'Ivoire who lived in Haringey, north London, was tortured and murdered by her guardians who believed she was possessed by an evil spirit. The belief, which was supported by their church leaders, led to her being beaten, burned with cigarettes, and forced to sleep in a bin liner in a bath before she was killed. Victoria Climbié, eight, and Kristy Bamu, 15, were murdered by relatives who thought they were possessed. Victoria's aunt and adoptive mother, Marie Therese Kouao, then 44, and her boyfriend Carl Manning, 28, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for Victoria's murder. In 2010, 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was tortured and beaten before he drowned in a bath at his sister's flat in east London after his sister and her boyfriend became convinced he was possessed by 'kindoki', or witchcraft, and was trying to harm or control another child in the family. Magalie Bamu, then 29, and her partner Eric Bikubi, 28, were jailed for life in 2012 after they were convicted of Kristy's murder. And in 2001, the torso of a young boy, named Adam by police, was found floating in the Thames. It is believed he may have been the victim of a ritual sacrifice practised in parts of Africa. Simon Bass from the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service said: 'We are not remotely surprised that the Metropolitan Police alone has already received 27 referrals of this type this year - or three a month. 'We are pleased that the Metropolitan Police has undertaken such great work in this area, but we are convinced that this form of abuse is hidden, and that the statutory agencies across the UK are facing similar situations.' Abuse survivor Kevani Kanda said: 'Mass migration has made this a pervasive problem worldwide, and it is not confined to cities or areas where there are large migrant communities. 'Belief-related abuse can result in significant physical and emotional harm, neglect, sexual abuse and even death.'

He braked and skidded to the ground, unhurt but making a mess of his clothes before a long day of work and school. He was on his bicycle that snowy morning last December, about an hour northwest of Washington, because the bus service in Frederick was so erratic. Routes were far apart and the buses often late, making a 30-minute bike ride, whatever the weather, a better option. His commuting problems highlight a central theme for many low-income people trying to build a better life: A lack of reliable and efficient transportation is often a huge barrier. In a large, continuing study of upward mobility based at Harvard, commuting time has emerged as the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty. The longer an average commute in a given county, the worse the chances of low-income families there moving up the ladder. The impact of transportation on social mobility is stronger than several other factors, like crime, elementary-school test scores or the percentage of two-parent families in a community, said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the researchers on the study. It notes the connection in places with notoriously long commutes and poverty including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Fla., and Birmingham, Ala. A separate report focusing on New York, from New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation, came to a similar conclusion. The study compared neighborhoods by accessibility to mass transit and the number of jobs within an hour’s commute. It found that residents of the areas least well-served by mass transit relied on personal vehicles. Areas in the middle third — those with some, but insufficient, access to transportation — had the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest incomes, the study found. For Mr. Baker and his fiancée, Andrea Zona, the lack of good transportation has been one of the few downsides of moving to Frederick County. He grew up in Washington and moved to the city of Frederick four years ago to study at Hood College, where he met Ms. Zona. Mr. Baker has worked at two 8-an-hour jobs — one as a lifeguard and another running a student activity room on campus — while interning at the Interfaith Housing Alliance. They live paycheck to paycheck, he said, with a little help from the state in the form of food stamps. Ms. Zona, who hails from northeast Pennsylvania, volunteers and works a 15-an-hour job in an archaeological laboratory. She hopes to get a job as a volunteer coordinator for AmeriCorps, a national organization focused on community service. Eight months ago she gave birth to their son, Quinn. “We’re working our way up in life,” said Mr. Baker, who has lined up a job coordinating financial classes with AmeriCorps after graduation. The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment, which costs 900 a month — a rent that would require them to live in a rougher neighborhood in Washington, where he said he wouldn’t want to raise his son. “You don’t have to worry about getting hurt at night in Frederick, compared to the way I would be living in D.C.,” Mr. Baker said. The couple feels that the town offers Quinn a bright future and that Frederick’s school system will set him on a better path. “I want him to have a better education than I had,” Mr. Baker said. The data from the Harvard study supports Mr. Baker’s hopes. It has tracked more than five million people who moved as children during the 1980s and 1990s and controlled for a variety of factors in an effort to isolate the way that a place affects children. The researchers concluded that Washington is roughly an average place for a lower-income child to grow up — but that Frederick is above average. Children who have previously moved from an average place to Frederick end up earning about 8 percent more as adults than similar children who did not move. Moreover, the younger a child is in such an above-average place, the more impact that place has on future earnings and other factors of social mobility. Frederick does not lift the odds of upward mobility quite so much as Washington’s closer-in suburbs, like Montgomery County, Md., or Fairfax, Va., — which have more expensive housing and better public transportation. But Mr. Baker and Ms. Zona seem to have solved, at least for now, their transportation problems. In January, they discovered a silver 2001 Toyota Corolla listed for 1,700 on the website of a local nonprofit, Second Chances Garage. Spotted with old stickers for Chicago sports teams, it has changed their daily routines. Commuting is easy, and they can now get to less expensive stores like Walmart and Target. “The car,” Mr. Baker said, “is the key to life in Frederick.” The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick your answer from: (i). no; (ii). yes;","output":"(i). no; While both questions are related to advertising, they are not paraphrases of each other and address different aspects of the advertising process. Advertising personalization refers to the practice of tailoring advertising messages to fit the individual needs, preferences, and characteristics of the target audience. This can include adjusting ad content, formatting, or display based on factors such as demographics, interests, online behavior, and geographic location. The goal of advertising personalization is to deliver more relevant and effective advertising experiences to consumers, thereby increasing the likelihood of engagement, conversion, and customer satisfaction. On the other hand, advertising, in general, is a broad term that describes the communication process between sellers (advertisers) and potential buyers (the audience) through various media channels. The primary objective of advertising is to promote products, services, or ideas, increase brand awareness, and ultimately influence purchase decisions. Advertising is an essential element of marketing and contains a wide range of methods, including television commercials, print ads, radio spots, online banners, social media posts, and more. In summary, advertising personalization and advertising are distinct concepts within the advertising landscape. Advertising personalization is a specific approach designed to create tailored messages for individual consumers, whereas advertising as a broader concept encompasses a wide range of techniques and strategies used to communicate product or service offerings to a target market."},{"instruction":"Student: Premise: \\"A lady and three small children all wearing jackets are walking hand in hand in the sidewalk of a busy downtown intersection.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A family of people walks on the sidewalk in a busy intersection.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Teacher: Let's think:","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we'll break down both statements and compare the relevant information. Premise: 1. A lady is present. 2. Three small children are present. 3. They are all wearing jackets. 4. They are walking hand in hand. 5. They are on the sidewalk of a busy downtown intersection. Hypothesis: 1. A family of people is present. 2. They are walking on the sidewalk. 3. They are in a busy intersection. Comparing these statements, we can see that the premise gives us information about a lady and three small children walking hand in hand on a sidewalk in a busy downtown intersection. The hypothesis, on the other hand, refers to a family of people walking on the sidewalk in a busy intersection. While it is reasonable to assume that the lady and the three children might be a family, the premise doesn't explicitly state that they are a family.

Hypothesis: They had a change in the service delivery system that was needed because the practice of law is getting simpler.. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise focuses on several reasons for needing a significant change in the service delivery system, primarily due to the increasing complexity of the practice of law, along with other factors such as the number of legal service providers, restrictions on LSC recipients, and changes in laws and programs affecting clients. On the other hand, the hypothesis provided contradicts the premise, stating that the practice of law is getting simpler. This statement is opposite to the premise that claims the \\"increasing complexity\\" of the practice of law as one of the reasons for the necessary change in the service delivery system. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported or entailed by the premise provided.

A: Available choices: A). dermatitis. B). morphogenesis. C). meiosis. D). symbiosis. Answer:","output":"The term for a relationship between two organisms where at least one benefits is D). Symbiosis. Symbiosis refers to the ecological interactions between two or more different species that live in close physical proximity to each other. These interactions can be either beneficial, neutral, or harmful to one or both parties involved. Symbiotic relationships are classified into three main categories based on the specific type of relationship: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. 1. Mutualism: In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit from their interaction. These relationships can be either obligate or facultative. In obligate mutualism, the organisms are so dependent on each other that they cannot survive without the other's presence. In facultative mutualism, although both organisms benefit from the relationship, they can still survive independently if necessary. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bees and flowering plants. Bees collect nectar for nourishment while also pollinating the plants in the process, which aids in the plant's reproduction. 2. Commensalism: This type of symbiotic relationship occurs when one organism benefits but the other is not significantly affected, either positively or negatively. The organism that benefits is called the commensal, while the unaffected organism is the host. An example of commensalism is the relationship between barnacles and whales. The barnacles attach themselves to the whale's body, gaining a place to live and access to nutrients as the whale moves. In contrast, the whale is not affected by the presence of the barnacles – either adversely or advantageously. 3. Parasitism: In a parasitic relationship, one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host). The parasite acquires resources, such as nutrients, from its host and causes harm in the process. This type of symbiotic relationship can occur in various forms, including endoparasitism (where the parasite lives inside the host), ectoparasitism (where the parasite lives on the host's surface), and brood parasitism (where the parasite lays its eggs in the nest of the host, allowing the host to care for its offspring). Examples of parasitism include ticks feeding on the blood of mammals and birds, and tapeworms living inside an animal's digestive system. In conclusion, symbiosis is the term for a relationship between two or more organisms where at least one benefits. These relationships can be further classified into mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, depending on the extent of the benefits and harms shared between the interacting species."},{"instruction":"Review: If there's one genre that I've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part. I never doubted Mol could handle the part since, but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago. Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be receiving nominations. Doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10 What is the sentiment of this review?

It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Context: Since 1952, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern. The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail. The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown. The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade. Question: How far is the longest trail ride?. Whats the answer?","output":"The longest trail ride among the 13 official trail rides that participate in the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo can last up to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. The trail rides have various lengths, with participants traveling at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour and covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. The exact distance of the longest trail ride may vary each year depending on the routes taken, but considering a ride can last up to three weeks with daily distances of up to 17 miles (27 km), the longest trail ride could potentially cover a distance of approximately 357 miles (575 km) in total."},{"instruction":"Q:The dumbest thing that actually worked?

And the answer is?","output":"Go Set a Watchman is the literary sequel to the renowned novel To Kill a Mockingbird, which was written by the celebrated American author, Harper Lee. Despite being written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman was only published in 2015, around 55 years following the publication of the first book. To Kill a Mockingbird was first published in 1960 and went on to become an instant classic, earning Harper Lee a Pulitzer Prize in 1961. The novel is a bildungsroman that addresses critical social issues of that era, such as racial inequality, class discrimination, and moral growth. Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s, it is told through the perspective of six-year-old Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, as the main protagonist, along with her brother Jem and friend Dill, who observes the innocence, injustice, and prejudices experienced by her father, Atticus Finch - a lawyer representing Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Go Set a Watchman, on the other hand, transports readers to the same fictional town of Maycomb, but with a different time setting, 20 years after the events portrayed in To Kill a Mockingbird. The sequel presents an adult Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, who returns to Maycomb from New York to visit her aging father, Atticus Finch. The story unravels the complexities of the Civil Rights Movement and explores Jean Louise's struggle to reconcile her evolved personal beliefs with those upheld by her community and her father. Although Go Set a Watchman was published as a sequel, it has been said that it was initially written before To Kill a Mockingbird and that it served as the first draft for the classic work. In summation, Go Set a Watchman is an intriguing sequel that broadens the themes of its predecessor, addressing once more the moral dilemmas and societal issues unique to that time and place while focusing on the evolution of the characters introduced in To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"instruction":"Q: If I tell you that Birds typically travel long distances, and ask you the question \\"what typically travels long distances?\\", is the correct answer \\"camels\\"?

She is widely accredited as the Mother of Asian Democracy. The first female president in the Philippines, Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which toppled the 21-year authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and restored democracy to the Philippines. Immediately after assuming the presidency, President Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, which established a revolutionary government. She abolished the 1973 Constitution that was in force during Martial Law, and by decree issued the provisional 1986 Freedom Constitution pending the ratification of a more formal, comprehensive charter. This allowed her to exercise both executive and legislative powers until the ratification of the 1987 Constitution and the restoration of Congress in 1987. Aquino promulgated two landmark legal codes, namely, the Family Code of 1987, which reformed the civil law on family relations, and the Administrative Code of 1987, which reorganized the structure of the executive branch of government. Another landmark law that was enacted during her tenure was the 1991 Local Government Code, which devolved national government powers to local government units (LGUs). The new Code enhanced the power of LGUs to enact local taxation measures and assured them of a share in the national revenue. Aquino closed down the Marcos-dominated Batasang Pambansa to prevent the new Marcos loyalist opposition from undermining her democratic reforms and reorganized the membership of the Supreme Court to restore its independence. In May 1986, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as \\"not merely a de facto government but in fact and law a de jure government\\", whose legitimacy had been affirmed by the community of nations. This Supreme Court decision affirmed the status of Aquino as the rightful leader of the Philippines. To fast-track the restoration of a full constitutional government and the writing of a new charter, she appointed 48 members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission (\\"Con-Com\\"), led by retired activist Supreme Court Associate Justice Cecilia Munoz-Palma. The Con-Com completed its final draft in October 1986. On February 2, 1987, the new Constitution of the Philippines, which put strong emphasis on civil liberties, human rights and social justice, was overwhelmingly approved by the Filipino people. The ratification of the new Constitution was followed by the election of senators and congress that same year and the holding of local elections in 1988. What did Proclamation No. 3 do?","output":"Proclamation No. 3, issued by President Corazon Aquino immediately after she assumed the presidency, established a revolutionary government in the Philippines. The main purpose of this proclamation was to dismantle the authoritarian rule that had been in place under President Ferdinand E. Marcos and to restore democracy to the country. By issuing Proclamation No. 3, Aquino abolished the 1973 Constitution that was enforced during Martial Law. In its place, she issued the provisional 1986 Freedom Constitution by decree. This temporary constitution served as a transitional instrument, allowing Aquino to exercise both executive and legislative powers until a new, more comprehensive charter could be ratified. The 1986 Freedom Constitution provided for the establishment of a Constitutional Commission (\\"Con-Com\\") to draft the new constitution. It also paved the way for the reorganization of the Supreme Court to restore its independence, as well as the closure of the Marcos-dominated Batasang Pambansa to prevent any potential interference with the democratic reforms. Proclamation No. 3 played a crucial role in transitioning the Philippines from an authoritarian regime back to a democracy.

The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do humans eat?\\" is not simply \\"sugar\\" based only on the fact that humans eat squid. The human diet is much more complex and varied than just sugar, and hence it is essential to go beyond such a simplistic answer when discussing their food habits. Humans have evolved over thousands of years, adapting to various environments and food sources. As omnivores, humans consume a wide variety of activities, including vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and seafood such as squid. While it's true that many of these food items contain sugar, either naturally occurring or as an additive, this cannot be the sole defining factor for human consumption. In terms of macronutrients, the human diet consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. All of these macronutrients have a vital role in our bodies and are essential for maintaining optimal health. Carbohydrates, which include sugars, are a primary source of energy for our bodies, while proteins are required for building and repairing tissue, as well as maintaining the proper functioning of our enzymes, hormones, and immune system. Fats are also a key source of energy, and they help our bodies absorb fat-soluble vitamins and produce hormones. The human diet also relies on a variety of micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, for general wellbeing. These micronutrients are found in a wide range of food items and are needed in smaller quantities than macronutrients, but they are equally vital for our health. Culture, environment, and personal preferences also play critical roles in shaping human diets. For example, Mediterranean cuisine may include olive oil, seafood, and legumes, while Southeast Asian cuisine is more likely to incorporate rice, soy, and fish. Religious beliefs can also influence diets; for instance, some followers of the Hindu religion practice vegetarianism, while many Muslims abstain from consuming pork. It is also vital to consider the changes in modern human diets due to globalization, industrialization, and advancements in science and technology. The availability of a vast array of food items from all over the world has drastically changed the way people eat today, with processed and fast foods becoming increasingly popular. In summary, stating the answer to \\"what do humans eat?\\" as merely \\"sugar\\" does not fully encompass the diversity and complexity of the human diet. While sugars are a part of various food items that humans consume, it is essential to recognize that human nutrition comprises many components, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, as well as being influenced by culture, environment, and personal preferences. Understanding these variances in our diets allows us to appreciate the extraordinary adaptability of the human species and the importance of varied and balanced nutrition for maintaining health and well-being."},{"instruction":"What key details about wilf shaw can be extracted from the following bio?

It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. - Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of 4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus orbits within Earth's orbit it is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia. - His name is derived from the Japanese words and . He is typically depicted as a demon-looking spirit beating drums to create thunder, usually with the symbol tomoe drawn on the drums. He is also known by the following names: - Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol () represents the god's sickle. - An ice giant is a giant planet composed mainly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. There are two known ice giants in the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune. Since 2014, there has been theoretical evidence of the existence of a possible third ice giant, which, if it exists, would be the Solar System's ninth planet. - Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of . It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol , a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Asha Patera is a patera, or a complex crater with scalloped edges, on Jupiter's moon Io. It is approximately 108 kilometers in diameter and located at . It is named after \\"asha\\", the Zoroastrian principle of Truth. Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1979. Reiden Patera and Kami-Nari Patera can both be found to the west. - The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at night. The term is usually associated with astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The aurora borealis and aurora australis light up the skies of the Arctic and Antarctic circles respectively. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind extend the phenomenon toward the equator. - An omphalos () is a religious stone artifact, or baetylus. In Greek, the word \\"omphalos\\" means \\"navel\\". In Greek lore, Zeus sent two eagles across the world to meet at its center, the \\"navel\\" of the world. Omphalos stones marking the centre were erected in several places about the Mediterranean Sea; the most famous of those was at Delphi. Omphalos is also the name of the stone given to Cronus. In the ancient world of the Mediterranean, it was a powerful religious symbol. \\"Omphalos Syndrome\\" refers to the belief that a place of geopolitical power and currency is the most important place in the world. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Reiden Patera is a volcanic feature on Jupiter's moon Io. It was first detected by the \\"Galileo\\" SSI Team during the spacecraft Galileo's first orbit around Jupiter, initially detected as a hotspot. It was once thought that the activity there had stopped or waned below the limits of the spacecraft's Solid State Imager or Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. However, it was noticed in 2002 that Reiden Patera has darkened considerably since the 24th orbit of \\"Galileo\\". It has been spouting bright red pyroclastic deposits of its own. It is located at and is 70 kilometers in diameter. It is named after a Japanese thunder god (\\"Raijin\\" in current English nomenclature). Asha Patera can be found to the east, and Kami-Nari Patera can be found to the north. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - In the material culture of classical antiquity, a phiale or patera is a shallow ceramic or metal libation bowl. It often has a bulbous indentation (\\"omphalos\\", \\"bellybutton\\") in the center underside to facilitate holding it, in which case it is sometimes called a mesomphalic phiale. It typically has no handles, and no feet. (A drinking cup with handles is a kylix. A circular platter with a pair of C-handles is not a patera, but a few \\"paterae\\" have a single long straight handle.) Although the two terms may be used interchangeably, particularly in the context of Etruscan culture, \\"phiale\\" is more common in reference to Greek forms, and \\"patera\\" in a Roman setting. - Kami - Nari Patera is a patera , or a complex crater with scalloped edges , on Jupiter 's moon Io . It is approximately 53 kilometers in diameter and is located at 8.7 ° S 235.08 ° W. It is named after the Japanese god of rolling thunder , Kami - Nari . Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2000 . Reiden Patera can be found to the south , and Asha Patera can be found to the east . - Asha (\\"aša\\") is the Avestan language term (corresponding to Vedic language ta) for a concept of cardinal importance to Zoroastrian theology and doctrine. In the moral sphere, \\"aša/arta\\" represents what has been called \\"the decisive confessional concept of Zoroastrianism.\\" The opposite of Avestan \\"aša\\" is druj, \\"lie.\\" - Material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make, or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present. Material culture studies is an interdisciplinary field telling of relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on theory and practice from the social sciences and humanities such as art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, historic preservation, folklore, literary criticism and museum studies, among others. Anything from buildings and architectural elements to books, jewelry, or toothbrushes can be considered material culture. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \\"ice giants\\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more \\"ices\\" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of , and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock. - A giant planet is any massive planet. They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. There are four known giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.

Last night, an audience of four billion people witnessed the lighting of the Olympic flame at the climax of a dazzling Opening Ceremony, marking the start of the 30th Summer Games in London. Athletes from all corners of the globe were cheered by a 60,000-strong crowd in a rapturous reception which will never be erased from their memories. While the majority of Britain's 541 athletes were present to enjoy the show, there were some who sadly couldn't be there. Triple sailing gold medallist Ben Ainslie lights the Olympic flame in a mini version of the Opening Ceremony held in Weymouth and Portland Harbour today. But Ainslie didn't stand on ceremony for long, taking part in the final Finn class practice race in Weymouth Bay. The white chalk horse of Osmington Hill can be seen in the background.

Q: Context: We developed an algorithm that prospectively defines when to excise the neurovascular bundles during radical retropubic prostatectomy with the goal of maximizing the performance of nerve sparing procedures while minimizing positive surgical margins.', 'From January 1 to December 31, 2000 a single surgeon performed 272 radical retropubic prostatectomies and 263 were performed from January 1 to December 31, 2001. A single pathologist analyzed all specimens with positive margins. There were no prospectively defined criteria to guide decisions regarding excision of the neurovascular bundles in the 2000 study cohort. Gleason score, percent tumor volume and perineural invasion were independently analyzed in the biopsy specimens according to the site of origin (right versus left side) for the 2001 group only. The ipsilateral neurovascular bundle was excised for Gleason 6 or less tumors when there were 50% or greater tumor volume in the biopsy specimen and perineural invasion, for Gleason 7 tumors when there was 30% or greater tumor volume, or perineural invasion and for Gleason 8 to 10 tumors when there was 10% or greater tumor volume, or perineural invasion.', 'There were no statistically significant differences between the 2000 and 2001 groups in regard to preoperative prostate specific antigen, clinical and pathological stage, biopsy Gleason score and percent tumor volume in the surgical specimen. There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of positive margins between the 2000 and 2001 groups (14% versus 8%, p = 0.027). The lower positive margin rate was not achieved because of a tendency to excise more neurovascular bundles since a significantly greater percent of neurovascular bundles was preserved in the 2001 group. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of our algorithm were 18%, 93%, 28%, 89% and 84%, respectively. In sides of the prostate with extraprostatic extension ipsilateral wide excision of the neurovascular bundle was associated with positive margins in 33% of cases compared with 22% when the neurovascular bundle was preserved (p = 0.42). Answer: The New York University nerve sparing algorithm prospectively defines when to excise the neurovascular bundle based on Gleason score, perineural invasion and tumor volume in the biopsy specimen. Use of this algorithm decreases positive surgical margin rates, while significantly increasing the preservation of neurovascular bundles.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

A: Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. Does the answer correctly answer the question OPT: a. yes. b. no.","output":"b. no. A more detailed and long answer would be: The Qin administrators introduced several significant reforms and innovations to the regions of Shu (modern-day Sichuan province) and Ba (now covered by eastern Sichuan and parts of Chongqing, Guizhou, and Hubei) following their conquest in 316 BCE. These methods aimed to unify a disparate populace, secure the territory, and increase the resources available to the central government. The key areas in which these changes were introduced include administration, taxation, land registration and distribution, standardization of laws and regulations, and construction projects. 1. Administrative Reforms: The Qin implemented a new administrative structure in Shu and Ba, dividing them into various prefectures and counties. These smaller divisions allowed for a more efficient governing system and ensured a tighter control over the affairs of the areas. In addition, the Qin officials introduced a strict hierarchy of administrators and civil servants to manage local affairs, thus effectively incorporating these remote regions into the broader centralized administrative structure of the empire. 2. Taxation and Land Distribution: One of the most significant changes introduced by the Qin administrators was the establishment of a uniform land registration and taxation system. This system was aimed at ensuring the equitable distribution of land and resources, as well as providing revenue for the state. By implementing a standard tax rate and requiring regular reporting of land usage and holdings, this system provided a stable basis for land management and facilitated the swift reallocation of land to deserving individuals based on merit. 3. Legal Standardization: The Qin administrators instituted a set of standardized laws and regulations to govern Shu and Ba, which aimed at ensuring a consistent application of justice throughout their realm. This \\"Legalist\\" framework encompassed various aspects of daily life, including trade, agriculture, and criminal matters, and served to uphold the authority of the governing authorities in the conquered regions. 4. Construction Projects: As part of their effort to integrate Shu and Ba into the Qin Empire, the administrators initiated several large-scale construction projects. Most notably, they set out to develop a vast network of roads and canals to facilitate trade, transport, and communication. One of these projects, the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, utilized advanced engineering techniques to harness the Min River, transform the arid landscape of the Chengdu Plain into fertile farmland, and increased agricultural output significantly. 5. Promotion of Agriculture: The Qin officials encouraged the development of agriculture in Shu and Ba by providing incentives such as tax reductions for farmers and promoting the use of advanced farming techniques. This focus on agriculture ensured the prosperity of the region and enabled the historically underutilized lands in Shu and Ba to become vital resources for the Qin Empire. In summary, the Qin administrators introduced a series of comprehensive reforms and innovations to Shu and Ba, fundamentally transforming these regions' political, economic, and legal structures. By incorporating the remote areas into the broader centralized framework of the Qin Empire, they laid the foundations for an efficient and manageable bureaucracy, enhanced the state's revenue, and ensured the long-term stability of these territories."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: no","output":"Question: Is it possible for a human to survive without water for an extended period of time, such as a month?

Sapphires can range in price from 50 per carat to more than 10,000 per carat, with the most expensive sapphire sold on record costing 135,000 per carat. The price of a sapphire is determined mostly by quality, and a large, low-quality sapphire can be a lot cheaper than a small yet very high-quality sapphire. For sapphires, color is king. Cut has the biggest impact on a stone's brilliance (how much light comes to the eye). Transparency and clarity (the number of inclusions) are also important in determining value. Settings made of cool tones metals like silver and white gold usually complements blue sapphires best. Padparadscha sapphires can look great in yellow gold settings, though, and pink sapphires look good in both silver and gold settings. Less reputable sellers may try to sell unwitting buyers a cheaper stone that looks like sapphire instead of a sapphire. Tanzanite, blue spinel, and blue tourmaline are among the stones that some may try to pass off as being true sapphires. National chains are often a good place to start because their business practices are more closely scrutinized than those of individual stores. If you do look at the selection offered by local jewelers and individual sellers, make sure that you ask to see the official certification of any sapphire you consider buying. A legitimate jeweler will be able to present you with certification from the GIA or independent, official gemstone societies. Retailers drive the price of sapphires up, since they need to charge beyond the price they paid for the stones to make a profit. Retail wholesalers, however, can sell you loose stones at close to wholesale prices. Buying loose stones and having them set separately can also cost less than buying pre-set stones, and loose stones allow you more chance to customize the piece of jewelry. Both settings have pros and cons. Shopping for sapphires online often proves cheaper than buying sapphire jewelry in store. On the other hand, shopping for sapphires in person allows you to examine the quality of the stone and the validity of the certificate with your own eyes before making a purchase. Each jeweler will have a slightly different stock of sapphires. As a result, you may be able to find two similar designs at different prices. As with anything else, shopping at multiple stores—both online and in person—improves your odds of finding the best quality sapphire for your budget.

How do I get a girlfriend that will love me? Well, little buddy, to have a girlfriend who will love you, you need to be a nice, caring, and friendly person. It's important to treat others well, listen to them, and share your feelings with them. As you grow up and meet new friends, you might find someone special who would also like to be your girlfriend.

No, little one, these questions are similar but they have slightly different meanings. The first question is asking how to find a loving girlfriend. The second question is asking how to get a girlfriend without emphasizing love. While both are about having a girlfriend, the first question focuses more on having a strong and loving bond with them."},{"instruction":"Possible review types: Available options: +negative +positive.

Fifty thousand Moors were forced to leave. Poets such as Ibn al-Abbar and Ibn Amira mourned this exile from their beloved Valencia. After the Christian victory and the expulsion of the Muslim population the city was divided between those who had participated in the conquest, according to the testimony in the Llibre del Repartiment (Book of Distribution). James I granted the city new charters of law, the Furs of Valencia, which later were extended to the whole kingdom of Valencia. Thenceforth the city entered a new historical stage in which a new society and a new language developed, forming the basis of the character of the Valencian people as they are known today.

He led an army composed of diverse groups, including Aragonese, Catalans, Navarrese, and crusaders from the Order of Calatrava. The siege of Valencia resulted in the city's surrender on September 28, followed by the expulsion of 50,000 Moors.

I suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The fabulous dancing that Kelly does? No. The time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters? No (that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters). Some comment that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s. So what if he wasn't an actor? He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him. Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling. You can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before. This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights. Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. A nice counter-point in the movie is how Sinatra (a ladies man even then) played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave.

Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. A:","output":"The territories that were not conquered by the Spanish during their colonization efforts in the Americas include parts of North America, South America, and Central America. Some of these unconquered territories consist of: 1. North America: - Most of the modern-day United States and Canada remained unconquered by the Spanish, with the exception of Florida, the southwestern United States, and some coastal regions. The French, British, and Dutch established colonies in these areas instead. 2. South America: - Large portions of modern-day Brazil were not conquered by the Spanish, but rather by the Portuguese, who established the colony of Brazil under the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. - Some areas of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana were also not under Spanish control, with Dutch, French, and British settlers establishing colonies in parts of these lands. 3. Central America: - In the article provided, it is mentioned that the Spanish did not conquer the area between Petén and much of Belize in Central America, even though the neighboring regions had been subjugated. This territory remained independent long after the surrounding peoples had been conquered by the Spanish. While the Spanish focused on the colonization of regions in the Caribbean, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America, other European powers seized the opportunity to establish their own colonies in the unconquered territories.

Cindy and Dean meet at Cindy's grandmother's nursing home while Dean is delivering a new resident's furniture and they begin dating afterwards. Cindy discovers she is pregnant, and tells Dean that the baby is most likely not his, as her ex-boyfriend Bobby didn't use protection. Dean asks Cindy whether or not she wants to keep the baby. At an abortion clinic, Cindy decides at the last moment to cancel the procedure, and on a bus ride home, Dean tells her he doesn't mind if the child is not his, and that he wants to begin a family with her. Before the wedding, Bobby finds out about Dean, and beats him up. Five years later, the couple lives in rural Pennsylvania with their daughter Frankie.

One evening, Dean insists on taking Cindy out for a romantic getaway at a motel so they can have some time off from their preoccupied lives, much to Cindy's reluctance.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Step by step answer:","output":"It is not necessarily true that \\"A man dressed up for a wedding\\" based on the provided sentence \\"A man sitting at a table with a scary mask covering his face.\\" Here's a step-by-step analysis to explain why: 1. Analyzing the sentence: The original sentence describes a man sitting at a table with a scary mask covering his face. There is no mention of a wedding or dressing up for a wedding. 2. Identifying key information: The core information in this sentence revolves around the man wearing a scary mask. This does not provide any context about a wedding or dressing up fo a wedding. 3. Evaluating context and assumptions: If wearing a scary mask were a known tradition or custom in weddings, the second statement might be plausible. However, wearing a scary mask is typically not associated with weddings. 4. Drawing conclusions: Based on the available information, one cannot infer that the man is dressed up for a wedding simply because he has a scary mask covering his face. In summary, the sentence \\"A man sitting at a table with a scary mask covering his face\\" does not necessarily imply that \\"A man dressed up for a wedding.\\" There is no clear connection between wearing a scary mask and attending a wedding, and the original sentence does not provide any further context to make such a conclusion."},{"instruction":"News article: Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Nowadays, we're used to getting online services for free. Free email from Google. Free cloud storage from Dropbox. Free streaming music from Spotify. The problem with that? You have to deal with ads. That's why Dalton Caldwell – you may remember him from this epic open letter to Mark Zuckerberg from a few days ago – started App.net, an alternative social network that you pay to use. Caldwell and his team are raising money in a Kickstarter-like project to bring App.net to life. The goal is to raise 500,000 in 30 days. As of this writing, App.net has received just under 400,000. Fundraising ends August 13. App.net functions a lot like Twitter, letting you follow users and view a feed of their updates. The company compares its service to how Twitter functioned \\"before it turned into a media company.\\" The platform is also open to developers to create apps that'll help make the App.net more useful. It's a noble-sounding effort, and App.net has gotten a lot of praise from tech pundits and other bigwigs in the industry such as Robert Scoble, Leo Laporte, and John Gruber. If you want to give App.net a try, you can donate now. A 50 donation gives you access to the service for one year, 100 adds the bonus of developer tools to start creating apps for App.net, and a 1,000 donation will score you a personal meeting with Dalton. ||||| Social media has gone mainstream, and jaded geeks are totally over it. Facebook? It's turned into \\"sludge for the brain now, filled with fluffy rabbits and gibberish.\\" Twitter? Just a mess of \\"mass-market spoonfed 'trending topics.'\\" Instagram? What was once the epitome of geek chic has been overrun with filthy Android smartphone users, not to mention Iran's Supreme Leader. So trendsetting geeks are pinning their hopes on a new, geekier-than-thou social network called App.net. For just 50, you, too can become part of this exclusive club of early adopters, free to sniff at the riffraff on Facebook and Twitter. Social networking has reached the crucial \\"alt\\" phase. App.net, the brainchild of long-time Silicon Valley entrepreneur Dalton Caldwell (above), sprung from an anti-Twitter rant he penned last month. The rant is full of technical jargon but boils down to the same argument that might be spewed by an indie rock fan upon hearing their favorite band's music in an Exxon commercial: Sell outs! Twitter went commercial. Now, Caldwell argues, they'd rather please their advertisers than their users. App.net sells itself with the same socially conscious self-satisfaction as a fair trade organic chocolate bar at Whole Foods: \\"Our product is the service that we sell, not our users,\\" is one promise. Cruelty-free social networking. And just like hipsters obsessing over the retro-cool of a vinyl record, App.net is taking the decidedly antiquated approach of charging for its service. It currently costs 50 to \\"join the movement\\" i.e. open an account. Caldwell is introducing App.net with a crowdsourcing stunt borrowed from Kickstarter: It will only launch if enough people chip in 50 (or more), to reach a 500,000 fundraising target. (It's currently at 355,450, with three days left.) Whitney Boesel at BuzzFeed suggests people are flocking to App.net because of digital \\"white flight,\\" with App.net being the gated suburbs where white users are trying to shut out the minorities and poor people who are increasingly using social media. But App.net's emphasis on its geek cred—\\"We're building a real-time social service where users and developers come first,\\" they say—seems to be more about a nostalgia for the early days of social networking, when the only people tweeting and Facebook-ing were super tech savvy early adopters. The 50 paywall, they hope, will mean only serious geeks will join up. \\"The mere fact of it being PAID FOR reducing the risk of morons and spammers,\\" wrote the illustrator Lucy Pepper. Will App.net really be able to convince enough geeks to pay 50 for admission to its organic Farmville? I wouldn't underestimate the geek hipster.

Step 2: Analyze the question The question asks when nutrients are absorbed into the body. I need to determine the correct answer based on the provided choices. Step 3: Evaluate the choices - After excretion: Excretion deals with the elimination of waste products. Since nutrients are needed in the body, absorbing them after excretion doesn't make sense. - Before digestion: Digestion deals with the breakdown of food into smaller elements. Nutrients can't be absorbed before they are broken down, so this option seems unlikely. - After digestion: Digestion breaks down food into simpler molecules that can be absorbed into the body. It's reasonable to think that nutrients may be absorbed after digestion. - During digestion: This option suggests that nutrients are absorbed simultaneously as the process of digestion is taking place. While this seems plausible, it is important to confirm whether nutrients are absorbed during or after digestion. Step 4: Choose the correct option Given the options, \\"after digestion\\" and \\"during digestion\\" are the most likely answers.

This is based on the premise that food can become contaminated with various bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemicals that can lead to illnesses. While food is not the only source of illness, it can definitely be one of them. These illnesses caused by contaminated food, also known as \\"foodborne illnesses\\", can be very serious and are a significant health issue worldwide. Numerous different pathogens and harmful substances can contaminate food, and it is often due to harmful practices in handling, storing, and preparing food that these agents are introduced. For example, food can become contaminated if it is not properly processed or cooked, allowing bacteria to thrive. Cross-contamination can also occur if raw and cooked food items come into direct contact with each other. Moreover, if food is not stored properly, such as at incorrect temperatures, bacteria and other pathogens can grow and multiply. It is also possible for food to be contaminated with harmful chemicals during the production and processing stages. Manifestations of foodborne illnesses can range widely in severity, from mild intestinal discomfort to more severe symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps and sometimes, life-threatening complications like kidney failure, chronic arthritis, brain and nerve damage. Some widely recognized foodborne infections are those caused by the bacteria Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli, as well as a group of viruses called Norovirus. Preventing foodborne illnesses is often a matter of practicing good food hygiene and safety. This can include steps such as washing hands and surfaces often, separating raw meats from other foods, cooking to the right temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly.

It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction.

Roach, a member of the faculty at Yale University, is Non-Executive Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and the author of The Next Asia. By Stephen S. Roach, Project Syndicate For seven years, the United States has allowed its fixation on the renminbi’s exchange rate to deflect attention from far more important issues in its economic relationship with China. The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the US and China is an excellent opportunity to examine – and rethink – America’s priorities. Since 2005, the US Congress has repeatedly flirted with legislation aimed at defending hard-pressed American workers from the presumed threat of a cheap Chinese currency. Bipartisan support for such a measure surfaced when Senators Charles Schumer (a liberal Democrat from New York) and Lindsey Graham (a conservative Republican from South Carolina) introduced the first Chinese currency bill. The argument for legislative action is tantalizingly simple: the US merchandise trade deficit has averaged a record 4.4% of GDP since 2005, with China accounting for fully 35% of the shortfall, supposedly owing to its currency manipulation. The Chinese, insists a broad coalition of politicians, business leaders, and academic economists, must revalue or face sanctions. This reasoning resonates with the US public. Opinion polls conducted in 2011 found that fully 61% of Americans believes that China represents a serious economic threat. As such, the currency debate looms as a major issue in the upcoming US presidential campaign. “Enough is enough,” President Barack Obama replied, when queried on the renminbi in the aftermath of his last meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Obama’s presumptive Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, has promised to declare China guilty of currency manipulation the day he takes office. But, however appealing this logic may be, it is wrong. First, America’s trade deficit is multilateral: the US ran deficits with 88 nations in 2010. A multilateral imbalance – especially one that it is traceable to a saving shortfall – cannot be fixed by putting pressure on a bilateral exchange rate. Indeed, America’s major threat is from within. Blaming China merely impedes the heavy lifting that must be done at home – namely, boosting saving by cutting budget deficits and encouraging households to save income rather than rely on asset bubbles. Second, the renminbi has now appreciated 31.4% against the dollar since mid-2005, well in excess of the 27.5% increase called for by the original Schumer-Graham bill. Mindful of the lessons of Japan – especially its disastrous concession on sharp yen appreciation in the Plaza Accord of 1985 – the Chinese have opted, instead, for a gradual revaluation. Recent moves toward renminbi internationalization, a more open capital account, and wider currency trading bands leave little doubt that the endgame is a market-based, fully convertible renminbi. Third, there has been significant improvement in China’s external imbalance. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China’s current-account surplus will narrow to just 2.3% of GDP in 2012, after peaking at 10.1% in 2007. American officials have long bemoaned China’s saving glut as a major source of global instability. But they should look in the mirror: America’s current-account deficit this year, at an estimated 510 billion, is likely to be 2.8 times higher than China’s surplus. Finally, China has evolved from the world’s factory to its assembly line. Research shows that no more than 20% to 30% of Chinese exports to the US reflect value added inside China. Roughly 60% of Chinese exports represent shipments of “foreign invested enterprises” – in effect, Chinese subsidiaries of global multinationals. Think Apple. Globalized production platforms distort bilateral trade data between the US and China, and have little to do with the exchange rate. Rather than vilifying China as the principal economic threat to America, the relationship should be recast as an opportunity. The largest component of US aggregate demand – the consumer – is on ice. With households focused on repairing severely damaged balance sheets, inflation-adjusted private consumption has expanded at an anemic 0.5% average annual rate over the past four years. Consumer deleveraging is likely to persist for years to come, leaving the US increasingly desperate for new sources of growth. Exports top the list of possibilities. China is now America’s third largest and most rapidly growing export market. There can be no mistaking its potential to fill some of the void left by US consumers. The key to realizing that opportunity lies in access to Chinese markets – all the more significant in light of China’s upcoming pro-consumption rebalancing. Historically, China has had an open development model, with imports running at 28% of GDP since 2002 – nearly three times Japan’s 10% import ratio during its high-growth era (1960-1989). As a result, for a given increment of domestic demand, China is far more predisposed toward foreign sourcing. As the Chinese consumer emerges, demand for a wide variety of US-made goods – ranging from new-generation information technology and biotech to automotive components and aircraft – could surge. The same is true of services. At just 43% of GDP, China’s services sector is relatively tiny. There is enormous scope for America’s global services companies to expand in China, especially in transactions-intensive distribution sectors – wholesale and retail trade, domestic transportation, and supply-chain logistics – as well as in the processing segments of finance, health care, and data warehousing. The US needs to refocus the US-China trade agenda toward expanded market access in these and other areas – pushing back against Chinese policies and government procurement practices that favor domestic production and indigenous innovation. Some progress has been made, but more is needed – for example, getting China to join the World Trade Organization’s Government Procurement Agreement. At the same time, the US should reconsider antiquated Cold War restrictions on Chinese purchases of technology-intensive items. For a growth-starved US, the opportunities of market access far outweigh the currency threat. The long-dormant Chinese consumer is about to be unleashed. This plays to one of America’s greatest strengths – its zeal to compete in new markets. Shame on the US if it squanders this extraordinary chance by digging in its heels at the upcoming Strategic and Economic dialogue.

Answer: To this day, most hunter-gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labour. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question and the information it requires. The question asks about the division of labor within groups, most likely referring to societies or social groups. Step 2: Research the topic of labor division in social groups to provide a comprehensive answer. Find information on how labor is divided in different societies, including hunter-gatherer groups, which are specifically mentioned in the question. Step 3: Provide context and examples for different types of labor divisions. In hunter-gatherer societies, labor is often divided based on the gender of individuals within the group. Men are primarily responsible for hunting and providing meat, while women are responsible for gathering plant-based foods, childcare, and other domestic tasks. This results in a gender-based division of labor, which is deeply ingrained in the social structure of these groups. In other social groups, labor can be divided based on age, social status, or skills. For instance: - In agricultural societies, there is a division of labor based on age and gender. Children often assist with simpler tasks like tending to animals, while older members of the group are involved in more skilled or strenuous activities. - In industrial societies, labor is frequently divided based on skills, education, and expertise, rather than solely on gender or other social factors. People often specialize in different professions and contribute to society through their specific area of knowledge. Step 4: Validate the answer based on the information provided.

Wash your face before you go to bed each night. Use a cleanser that doesn't irritate your skin. Try the oil cleansing method. Wash your face in the morning. Exfoliate every few days.","output":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Managing Pore Size: Cleansing, Exfoliating, and More Introduction Pore size is often a concern for many people, especially those with oily or acne-prone skin. Although pore size is hereditary and cannot be changed, there are certain skincare habits that can help minimize their appearance and improve your skin's overall health. In this article, we will explore various methods for managing pore size, including an effective cleansing routine, exfoliating, and the oil cleansing method. Understanding Pore Size and its Hereditary Nature Pore size is determined by various factors, including genetics, ethnic background, skin type, and age. Our pores are essentially openings for hair follicles and oil glands, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the skin's health by allowing oil (sebum) and sweat to be secreted through them. People with larger pores tend to have oilier skin, as their sebaceous glands produce more oil. Since pore size is influenced by hereditary factors, it is almost impossible to change their structure entirely. However, proper skin care habits can make them appear smaller and improve skin's overall appearance. Effective Cleansing Routine for Managing Pore Size 1. Nightly Cleansing: Washing your face before going to bed is a crucial step for maintaining healthy and clean skin. It helps remove dirt, oil, makeup, and other impurities that accumulate on your skin throughout the day. Skipping this step may clog your pores, leading to acne breakouts and blackheads. Choose a gentle cleanser that does not irritate your skin. For sensitive skin, opt-out for fragrance-free and non-comedogenic products. 2. Morning Cleansing: Washing your face in the morning helps remove excess oil and dead skin cells that accumulate during the night. This simple, yet essential step refreshes the skin and prepares it for the day ahead. Make sure to use a gentle cleanser suitable for your skin type to avoid over-stripping the skin's natural oils. 3. Oil Cleansing Method: This powerful cleansing method involves using oil (such as olive, coconut, or jojoba oil) to dissolve and remove impurities from the skin. Massage a small amount of oil onto your face for a couple of minutes, concentrating on areas with larger pores and blackheads. Gently wipe off the oil with a warm, damp cloth. This method is highly effective in removing dirt and impurities without disrupting the skin's natural oil balance. Many people find that implementing oil cleansing into their routine helps reduce the appearance of pores and improve overall skin texture. Exfoliation for Smaller-Looking Pores Exfoliating is a key component in managing pore size. It helps remove dead skin cells, dirt, and other debris that can accumulate within the pores, making them appear larger. For optimal results, exfoliate your skin every few days with a gentle scrub or chemical exfoliants containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHA). Avoid over-exfoliating, as it can cause irritation and damage to the skin. Regular exfoliation can help to refine your skin's texture, giving the illusion of smaller pores and a more even complexion. Conclusion While it's essential to acknowledge that pore size is hereditary and cannot be drastically altered, there are skin care practices that can help manage their appearance and promote overall skin health. Adopting an effective cleansing routine, using the oil cleansing method, and exfoliating regularly are key strategies in improving the look of your pores. Remember that consistency is crucial; maintaining a dedicated skincare routine will yield the best results for minimizing the appearance of pores and achieving a healthy, glowing complexion."},{"instruction":"\\"Moss needs the blood of slugs to survive.\\" Is the above claim true? Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. Consider the organisms in question, moss and slugs. 2. Analyze whether moss and slugs have any known biological relationships. 3. Research debunking or reinforcing the claim. 4. Assess the legitimacy of the sources of information. 5. Form a conclusion based on the available evidence. Step 1: Mosses are non-vascular plants that typically grow in damp or shady locations. Slugs are common mollusks that can sometimes be found in similar environments.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. PAUL GIGOT, HOST: This week on the \\"Journal Editorial Report,\\" as the president unveils his gun control agenda, we'll look at the good, the bad and the probably unconstitutional. Plus, from immigration to deficit reduction, what else is on his second-term to-do list. And is compromise or confrontation the real goal? Plus, the suicide of an Internet activist has his family crying foul. Was Aaron Swartz a victim of government intimidation and a run-away federal prosecutor? PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: While there's no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try it. GIGOT: Welcome to the \\"Journal Editorial Report.\\" I'm Paul Gigot. That was President Obama rolling out the administration's plan to curb gun violence. The president outlined 23 executive actions, including steps to make more federal data available from background checks and increased access to mental health services. And he called on Congress to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban and prohibit high-capacity gun magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. So, what's likely to get passed and what difference will it make? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; Political Diary editor, Jason Riley; and Washington columnist, Kim Strassel. So, Dan, just as a hypothetical, let's assume that everything the president is proposing becomes law. What difference would it make? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, it's not quite a hypothetical, Paul. The president just said, if we can save just one life, if we have to do this. From 1994, to 2004, we had the law banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. The National Research Council and the Centers for Disease Control took a deep look at the effect of that law and their conclusion was it was impossible to determine whether it had reduced any crime in the United States. In 2005, the National Research Council looked again. Their conclusion was that the government's collection of data about guns is so poor, that it's impossible to understand whether any good is coming of these laws. You'd hate to reduce it to something as bureaucratic as the federal government's inability to track these guns, but that is about what it comes down to. There is just no evidence that those laws make any difference. JASON RILEY, POLITICAL DIARY EDITOR: In fact, Paul, gun violence has fallen since the assault weapons ban expired. GIGOT: In 2004 was it, I think? RILEY: In 2004. So, the relevant question is that these are proposals being put forward in response to Sandy Hook and gun violence overall in the country. So, will they address that problem? The universal background check would have been passed by the person who bought the gun used in Connecticut. GIGOT: Well, let me argue that some the things he's proposed on mental health, for example, easing the law called HIPAA, which is a federal privacy law, if you ease that and allow people, like administrators in schools or doctors and medical officers, to be able to share information when they see some kid who seems to be troubled, and identify him and maybe push him into assisted treatment, that kind of thing would help, seems to me. HENNINGER: It would definitely help. That side of it is the piece we haven't had much of a conversation about. GIGOT: It's almost like an afterthought. The president offered it, but may be the most effective. HENNINGER: But the Newtown events, the Virginia Techs, the sort of killing in the theaters in Colorado by these violently mentally ill people really is not related to gun control. It's about what you're describing, which is monitoring and ensuring that those people are taking their medication, and that's what's been a weak part of the system until perhaps now. RILEY: Let's also keep in mindless that than 3 percent of gun crimes in this country involve the assault weapons that the president wants to ban. GIGOT: Most of them are handguns actually. GIGOT: So why isn't he proposing then to ban handguns? If most people, who are victims of gun violence, are killed by handguns, why not ban handguns. HENNINGER: Because the banned guns, they are illegal on the streets of Chicago and New York -- HENNINGER: -- in gang crimes. RILEY: There is a Second Amendment there, right. GIGOT: And that was found in 2008, the Heller case -- GIGOT: -- which expressly involved handguns and guns in common use. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article from the \\"Journal Editorial Report,\\" dated January 19, 2013, primarily revolves around the gun control agenda of former President Barack Obama. Following the unveiling of his ambitious plan, the article debates the potential consequences, probing into the beneficial, harmful, and possibly unconstitutional aspects in a bid to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Obama, in his second term, addressed the nation on gun violence and discussed executive actions to curb it. His plan comprised of 23 executive actions, focusing on two main aspects: improving the availability of federal background check data and enhancing access to mental health services. Notably, he urged the Congress to reintroduce the federal ban on assault weapons and proposed a prohibition on high-capacity gun magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. However, the effectiveness of these proposals is put into question in the discussion that follows. Citing two studies conducted by the National Research Council and the Centers for Disease Control, one of the panelists, Dan Henninger, argued that the impact of similar legislations in the past has proven to be inconclusive. Moreover, since the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004, Jason Riley pointed out that gun violence has significantly decreased. The panelists also highlighted the need to address mental health concerning gun violence. The easing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was proposed, allowing administrators and medical personnel to share critical information about potential troubled individuals and possibly direct them towards timely assistance. But despite a considerable part of gun violence being perpetrated using handguns, the article noted that Obama did not propose any regulations for them. The panelists examined this, with the argument that handguns are most often used in illegal activities in cities like Chicago and New York. However, they acknowledged that any restriction would have to adhere to the Second Amendment, as dictated by the landmark 2008 Heller case. In conclusion, the most important parts of this article are the description and critical analysis of former President Barack Obama's gun control agenda. The outlined executive actions, the debate over their effectiveness, the consideration of mental health implications within the context of gun violence, and the constitutional restrictions concerning any potential regulation of handguns are all key aspects addressed."},{"instruction":"Q:WHITE HOUSE — A debate over patriotism and the right of free expression is continuing in the United States with President Donald Trump extending his criticism of professional athletes who decline to stand for the national anthem.

Democrats on Tuesday captured the House of Representatives and are set to exert a major institutional check on President Trump, while breaking the Republican monopoly on power and ushering in a younger, more female and more racially diverse political generation. But the GOP solidified their Senate majority after an acerbic midterm election that enshrined America's deep divides and shaped a highly contentious battleground for the stirring 2020 presidential race. Stick with CNN Politics as we sort through the changed political landscape. ||||| Republicans retained control of the Senate on Tuesday, ousting Democratic incumbents in Indiana and North Dakota and handing President Donald Trump a triumph by ensuring they will remain as guardians of his conservative agenda for two more years. Despite Trump's deeply polarizing effect on voters, the GOP harnessed his rock-solid popularity with hard-right voters in rural, deep-red states. They held onto seats in the South, Midwest and West and ensured at least a 50-50 Senate — enough to give Republicans control because Vice President Mike Pence as president of the Senate would tip the balance to the GOP. Republicans paved their path to victory by defeating Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. They also held on to competitive seats in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz fended off Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the well-financed liberal darling, and in Tennessee, where Rep. Marsha Blackburn prevailed. The GOP Senate victory was magnified because Democrats stood a solid chance of wresting control of the House from Republicans. That would give the Senate the role of blocking House-passed Democratic initiatives on everything from health care to the potential repeal of tax cuts on the wealthy that the GOP enacted last year. It would also leave the Senate as the showcase for the GOP's goals of tax and spending cuts, trade, immigration restrictions, curbs on Obama's health care law and judicial nominations. Republicans entered the night commanding the Senate only narrowly, 51-49. But a crucial piece of math was in their favor Tuesday: The Democrats and their two independent allies were defending 26 seats, Republicans just nine. Blackburn, a conservative who is also an ardent Trump backer, defeated former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, 74. Bredesen had promised a bipartisan approach if elected and had won the endorsement of music star Taylor Swift. Heitkamp lost to GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, whom Trump persuaded to seek the Senate seat. Heitkamp was hurt late in her campaign by an ad that mistakenly named some women as victims of sexual abuse. The night's news wasn't completely disastrous for Democrats. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin was re-elected in West Virginia, a state Trump captured by 42 percentage points in his 2016 election triumph. Democratic incumbents also prevailed in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Midwestern states that Trump carried narrowly two years ago. Overall, Democrats were defending seats in 10 states that Trump took in 2016, including five he won by at least a huge 19 percentage points. Trump prevailed in Indiana by 19 points. Tuesday's midterm elections were among the most bitter in years. Democrats' longshot prospects for capturing a Senate majority were pinned on expectations that their supporters, roused by revulsion toward Trump, would surge to the polls. Fueling their intensity have been Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and policies, his efforts to dismantle health care protections enacted under President Barack Obama and the #MeToo movement's fury over sexual harassment. \\"Ever since President Trump has been in office, it has just been not the country that I am used to or that I thought I would be in,\\" said Sarah Roth, 22, a Democratic voter from Minnetonka, Minnesota. \\"And so this really was my opportunity to help this country in changing who is making the decisions.\\" Democrats also had history on their side: 2002 was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats. Republicans were banking on those dynamics being offset by a vibrant economy and by a president whose insult-laden approach to political discourse was as stirring for conservative voters as it was infuriating to liberals. Trump's racially tinged anti-immigrant rhetoric, while unpopular among college-educated urban and suburban voters, seemed helpful in deeply conservative areas. \\"I believe he values immigration, but he wants to make sure we're safe,\\" said Tina Newby of Wetland, Michigan, a GOP voter. \\"I like the fact that he is not a politician, and I forgive some of the socially incorrect or politically incorrect things that he says.\\" With so much at stake, Trump campaigned in over a dozen states with Senate elections since Labor Day, visiting some multiple times. He himself has characterized the election as a referendum on his presidency. AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press, highlighted the effect Trump was having on voters. Nearly 4 in 10 said they were casting ballots to express opposition to him, while just 1 in 4 said their vote was an expression of support for the president. In other results, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democrats Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar were easily re-elected. Along with Sherrod Brown, a pro-labor lawmaker re-elected in Ohio, the four are considered potential 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. GOP hopes of gaining a seat from New Jersey were dashed when Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez won a third Senate term. Menendez won in the heavily Democratic state despite a federal bribery indictment that prosecutors dropped this year after a mistrial. Also victorious was Republican Mitt Romney, the vanquished 2012 GOP presidential candidate who grabbed the Utah seat being vacated by the retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch. Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, his party's defeated 2016 vice presidential candidate, won re-election to the Senate. Amid the recent rash of letter bombs and the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, Trump issued alarming and often unfounded warnings about caravans of migrants crossing Mexico toward the U.S., blaming Democrats, without evidence, for the threat he claimed they pose. AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago ___ AP reporters Jeff Baenen in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and John Flesher in Traverse City, Michigan, contributed. ||||| Conservative Rep.

If it continues to eat at the same rate, in how many more days will its total consumption be 104 pounds? Option A: 8 Option B: 7 Option C: 16 Option D: 10 Option E: none of the above","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions to find the rate at which the animal is consuming food. First, we'll find the rate at which the animal is consuming food per day: 39 pounds of food in 6 days = 39/6 = 6.5 pounds of food per day. Now, we want to find how many more days it will take for the animal to consume a total of 104 pounds. To do this, we can use the same rate we found earlier: Total consumption = (rate of consumption) * (number of days) 104 pounds = 6.5 pounds/day * (number of days) To find the number of days, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6.5 pounds/day: 104 pounds / 6.5 pounds/day = number of days 16 = number of days However, this represents the total number of days for the animal to reach 104 pounds of food consumption. Since we've been asked to find how many more days it will take, we need to subtract the 6 days already passed: 16 - 6 = 10 Thus, it will take the animal 10 more days to consume a total of 104 pounds of food. The correct answer is Option D: 10."},{"instruction":"The elegant luxury villa is situated in a peaceful wooden area on the hills around Fucecchio (Florence), in Lower Valdarno,and is surrounded by century-old oak and pine trees.

When you press down on the pedal, it should move smoothly and spring up right each time. If you’re having a hard time moving the pedal with any consistency, then the clutch fluid level has likely run low. It could also be from air getting into the clutch fluid reservoir. The fluid lubricates the clutch so it responds when you use it to control the car’s speed. Without it, the mechanical components wear out at a much faster rate. Air bubbles prevent the clutch from engaging properly and are often caused by leaks. If you have replaced the clutch fluid recently, that could also cause air to get into the reservoir. Starting with the car in first gear, press down on the clutch to build up speed. Press it again when the engine reaches about 2,000 RPM and shift into second gear. Watch for anything out of the ordinary, such as the vehicle lurching, a stuck clutch, or a grinding noise. Visit a mechanic right away to solve most of these problems. For something like a stuck clutch, check the fluid level first. A drained reservoir will prevent the clutch from working. Transmission problems are very serious and difficult to repair at home. Don’t ignore signs like grinding gears or a clutch that won’t work at all. . Fresh clutch fluid has a clear yellow coloring. It darkens, turning red or black, over time. If the fluid looks dirty, bleed it from the clutch valve underneath your vehicle. If it still looks clear, simply top off the reservoir tank as needed with new fluid. Bleeding the valve requires you to jack up the vehicle’s front end and get under it. Once you find the valve, you attach a rubber hose to it and press the clutch to drive out the fluid. However, keep the tank full by adding new fluid after every couple of presses. If you’re uncertain about doing this on your own, contact a mechanic to have them deal with the clutch fluid. Jacking up a car is dangerous when it isn’t done properly. Like any other car parts, the components responsible for operating the clutch wear out over time. Open the engine bay and examine the clutch fluid reservoir. Have a friend press the clutch pedal down while you keep an eye on the fluid level. Check the reservoir tank and the parts around it for leaked fluid. If you notice a leak, get an identical replacement part or take the vehicle to a professional right away. You may not notice small leaks right away. One easy way to spot hidden leaks is by noting the fluid level, then checking it again after several days. If it has changed by a noticeable amount, then your vehicle needs repairs. The slave cylinder is a small component located above the transmission on your engine. To find it, follow the cables running from the clutch reservoir to the engine. Have a friend press the clutch pedal a few times while you watch for the slave cylinder to move. Check it for leaks or bubbles as well. If the cylinder doesn’t move, it has to be replaced. Take the vehicle to a mechanic. Leaks can be fixed by replacing parts. Have a mechanic do it if you are unable to do it on your own. If you do it on your own, you will need to bleed out the clutch valve afterward.","output":"The process of examining and maintaining the clutch system involves several steps, which include checking the clutch pedal movement, assessing the clutch fluid level, and addressing any issues such as leaks or air bubbles. The clutch pedal movement is crucial for smooth operation, and any inconsistencies may be a sign of low clutch fluid or air trapped in the reservoir. Clutch fluid lubricates the clutch, preventing wear on mechanical components, and can be affected by factors like leaks or a recent fluid change. Checking the gear shifting for any unusual behavior, such as lurching, a stuck clutch, or grinding noises, is essential for identifying potential transmission problems. If any of these issues occur, a prompt visit to a mechanic is advised. Clutch fluid levels should be monitored and topped up or replaced if it appears dirty or dark. As bleeding the clutch valve may be a risky process for inexperienced individuals, consulting a mechanic is always recommended. Investigating possible leaks involves observing the clutch fluid reservoir and surrounding components, and taking note of any discrepancies in fluid levels over a few days. If leaks are detected, replacement parts may be needed or professional help sought. Additionally, monitoring the slave cylinder for movement and checking for leaks or bubbles is essential to ensure proper clutch operation. If the cylinder is not moving, a mechanic should be consulted to replace the component. In summary, maintaining the clutch system involves careful observation of the clutch pedal, fluid levels, and accompanying components, alongside addressing any issues that may arise to ensure smooth, safe driving. When in doubt or facing complex repairs, professional assistance from a mechanic is always the best course of action."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Paragraph: Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli are involved in diarrhea in 2 to 8-week old calves. The virulence factors of these bacteria include: (i) the secretion of proteins (i.e. EspB) involved in microvilli effacement, (ii) the production of the intimin, a 94 kDa outer membrane protein encoded by the eaeA gene and involved in the intimate attachment of bacteria to epithelial cell and (iii) the production of verotoxins: VT1 and/or VT2. We investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by genetic amplification. Using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5% of calves who died from diarrhea presented EaeA E. coli strains and secondly that 19% of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage. However, using colony hybridization and genetic amplification, we identified EaeA strains in 91% of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems. In 66% of the calves, there was a correlation between the presence of AEEC and diarrhea. At the pathotype level, most of the EaeA isolates were negative for VT probes. In VT bacteria, the majority were VT1. The number of VT positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves. This underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease. Moreover, only 25% of the bovine AEEC were positive with the EaeB probe. Surprisingly, the proportion of EaeB strains was significantly higher in healthy calves than in other populations. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Computer systems manage and protect increasingly high value information and assets across the enterprise . Meanwhile , hackers grow in number and resourcefulness . Commercial virtualization solutions add to the already fertile attack surface of enterprise operating systems . What may happen before a computer system is hacked ?","output":"Before a computer system is hacked, several events and circumstances take place that contribute to creating the opportunity for the hacker to exploit vulnerabilities and eventually gain unauthorized access or control. These events include: 1. Identifying Vulnerabilities: Hackers often start by researching and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the computer system, either by analyzing the software code or by looking for known security issues in public domain databases and forums. This step enables them to understand the weaknesses in the system which they can exploit. 2. Information Gathering: The next step usually involves gathering information on the target system or organization. This can include data about user accounts, network architecture, software types and versions, and other valuable details that can help the attacker in gaining access to the system. In some cases, this may involve an attacker doing reconnaissance, or \\"footprinting,\\" to determine potential entry points for the attack. 3. Planning the Attack: Hackers typically devise a strategy to exploit the identified vulnerabilities and create the necessary tools for the attack. This may include writing custom malware or scripts, creating phishing emails to trick users into revealing login credentials, exploiting known vulnerabilities or bugs in the software, and creating botnets, among other methods. 4. Testing and Improvisation: Hackers often test their attack methods and tools in isolated environments to minimize detection and maximize their chances of success. This process may involve tweaking and adjusting their attack methodologies as they uncover new information, as well as identifying ways to bypass security measures in place on the target system. 5. Gaining Initial Access: The attacker may employ a variety of tactics to gain initial access to the target system. This could include actions like social engineering or phishing to trick users into revealing their access credentials or clicking on a malicious link, exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, or utilizing other hacking techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks or SQL injection attacks. 6. Establishing Persistence: Once initial access is achieved, hackers often attempt to establish persistence by deploying malware, backdoors, or other means to maintain their foothold within the target environment. This enables them to carry out their objectives without being detected or removed by security teams. 7. Evading Detection: To avoid detection, attackers may use techniques like hiding their activities behind encryption or obfuscation, utilizing anti-forensic tactics to erase their tracks, or leveraging tools that evade security controls like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Before a computer system is actually hacked, these activities typically occur in the background, often without the knowledge of the systems' owners or security teams, creating the foundation for a successful cyber attack."},{"instruction":"Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.

President Barack Obama has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through Congress, but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else. The midterm elections will be extraordinarily important for the composition of Congress. If Republicans can expand their numbers in the House and Senate, they might develop enough muscle to stifle Obama from accomplishing anything else. It could also be enough to put pressure on moderate Democrats to further undercut the legislative gains of the first term by enacting spending cuts and weakening the regulatory apparatus of programs like Dodd-Frank. On the other hand, if Democrats do well they can improve their standing in the House and place more pressure on Republicans to make compromises. Besides the composition of Congress, the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election. The shape of the campaigns will start to clarify what the Republicans intend to stand for and whether they can put forth ideas that excite, rather than turn off, voters outside the reddest parts of the country. The rebellion taking place within the GOP has been growing more intense. Many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat. Many Republicans privately agreed when former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said the GOP ought to be \\"closed for repairs\\" until next year, and in the meantime, \\"spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda.\\" Since 2010, Republicans invested almost everything in the issue of deficit reduction and saying no to everything that came out of the White House. The bet hasn't been paying off. At a certain point, voters seem to have lost interest in the message and, now that the long-term budget picture is doing much better while the economics of austerity has come under fire, the issue is gaining even less voter traction. The midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for Republicans to show voters they have something more to say, and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the White House. Democrats face a similar challenge. They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-Obama age. Many Democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan's record and essentially promised to do more of the same, just in kinder and gentler fashion. Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008? Voters want to hear what Democrats have to say about federal investments in the nation's economic future, about how to handle climate change and how to build on Obama's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security. If Democrats can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on, they could not only bolster their numbers on the Hill but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters. There are also questions about the mood of the electorate. Everyone will have a close eye on the immigrant vote. Although the turnout is much smaller in midterm elections, given the heat of the immigration debates, it will be significant to see if the energy levels are still high among immigrants for the Democrats and how much Republicans have been able to improve their standing with some high-profile party members like Marco Rubio coming out for reform. It will also be important to see whether any kind of anti-immigrant backlash sets in, similar to what Democrats saw against civil rights in 1966 following the race riots in Watts and other cities. The outcome of the debate over immigration legislation in the House will have a big effect. The aftermath of the recent controversies will also be significant. Right now the political cycle is in full scandal swing. The midterms will provide some sense of whether those stories have legs, either detrimentally for Democrats as Republicans suffered in 1974 after Watergate or whether a backlash sets in against the GOP, as New Gingrich and his allies suffered in 1998 amid the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Finally, the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff. In 1966, former Vice President Richard Nixon seized the national spotlight, campaigning for Republicans across the nation, and making it clear, through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on Lyndon Johnson, or any other Democrat. This year, candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to use this moment, with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field, for the same advantage. It will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down, such as the right-wing drift of the GOP -- which could hurt the chances of the Republican candidates in 2016, regardless of how charismatic and talented they are. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The upcoming midterm campaigns and elections are crucial for both Democrats and Republicans in determining the composition of Congress and providing insights into the challenges faced by each party. The outcome of these elections could either give Republicans more leverage to hinder President Obama's accomplishments or enable Democrats to strengthen their stance in the House. For Republicans, the midterm elections provide an opportunity to display their ideas and future agenda to voters and demonstrate how they differentiate from the current administration. They need to shift their focus from deficit reduction and develop a more attractive message that will engage voters outside of their core constituencies. The rebellion within the GOP highlights the internal struggles and calls for change, emphasizing that the party should reevaluate their agenda and come up with fresh, innovative ideas. On the other hand, Democrats face the challenge of defining their party's agenda in the upcoming post-Obama era. They must determine whether they will continue with the current policies or offer a more transformative agenda that addresses new challenges faced in 2016 and beyond. Democrats also need to focus on issues like federal investments, climate change, and civil liberties in order to create a strong platform for future candidates. The mood of the electorate, particularly the immigrant vote, will play a significant role in these midterm elections. It is essential for both parties to consider their stance on immigration and avoid any potential backlash. The controversies surrounding the recent political scandals may also have an impact on the outcome of these elections, either negatively affecting the Democrats or creating a backlash against the GOP. Lastly, the midterm elections serve as a platform for future presidential candidates to showcase their potential. Potential candidates like Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie will seize this opportunity to establish themselves as strong contenders and demonstrate their ideas and policies to the electorate. The midterm elections are a critical point where both parties must address their challenges and reevaluate their agendas, ultimately shaping the political landscape for the upcoming years."},{"instruction":"What is instafinancials.com?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...

Officials and witnesses reported widespread destruction across various districts, particularly in the northwestern regions of the country, with homes and infrastructure being severely damaged from the powerful gales and heavy rainfall. Struggling to manage the aftermath of the storms, Bangladesh has called for national support to help those affected by this deadly weather event. Originating from the Bay of Bengal, these storms swept across Bangladesh with relentless intensity, causing panic and fear among the citizens. The government’s meteorological office warned that the cyclonic winds, which reached speeds of more than 50 mph, posed a significant danger to those caught in the storms' path. The most severely affected areas as of now include the districts of Rangpur, Kurigram, Sirajganj, and Bogra. Among the tragic deaths within these districts was a schoolgirl who was fatally struck by a falling tree. Rangpur Division has reported at least five deaths and over 25 injured individuals, while other districts continue their efforts to assess the full scope of the destruction and discover any further casualties or injuries. In the midst of this disaster, brave volunteers, local government personnel, and emergency responders have arrived in these hard-hit districts to search for survivors and provide initial aid to the injured. The sheer magnitude and destruction of the storms have rendered these operations extremely challenging, requiring additional external resources in order to coordinate and effectively carry out life-saving measures. Bangladesh is no stranger to extreme weather events, and its climate, coupled with its dense population, extensive low-lying lands, and fragile infrastructure, renders the nation highly vulnerable to such natural catastrophes. In 2020, the country was hit by Cyclone Amphan, causing the deaths of at least 26 people and leaving thousands without shelter. The aftermath of these recent storms underscores the urgent need for not only immediate response and aid but also long-term planning and investment in disaster risk reduction. Early warning systems, capacity building within emergency services, resilient infrastructure, and focused climate change adaption efforts are all vital to minimize the risks and impacts of future weather events. Furthermore, increased international efforts to mitigate climate change are crucial for the well-being and safety of nations such as Bangladesh. As rescue and recovery operations continue, the government of Bangladesh and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have appealed for immediate assistance from the international community. Aid in the form of emergency medical supplies, temporary shelter, food, water, and resources for rebuilding is desperately needed to assist those affected by the storms. The people and government of Bangladesh are uniting in the face of this tragedy, demonstrating their adaptability, resilience, and determination to overcome these devastating storms. It is of utmost importance that the international community supports Bangladesh during this difficult time, providing not only immediate aid but also investing in long-term partnerships and collaborative initiatives to strengthen the country's preparation for future weather events and reduce the suffering caused by these deadly disasters."},{"instruction":"We'll bomb them, and then come down here to Libya and bomb the rest of the guys.

They quickly identified the lethal substance involved as Mephedrone, a drug that was made illegal in 2010. Since its ban, this narcotic has been responsible for several deaths and hospitalizations, leading law enforcement to crack down on those responsible for its distribution. Step 2: Provide context regarding Mephedrone Mephedrone, or meow-meow, is a synthetic stimulant that belongs to a group of drugs called cathinones. It had been legally sold as a 'legal high' before being classified as a Class B drug in 2010, due to its dangerous effects. The drug has been linked to numerous cases of severe physical and mental health issues, including heart problems, anxiety, and depression. Step 3: Discuss police raids and arrests In an effort to trace the source of the Mephedrone which caused the two fatalities, police conducted a series of orchestrated raids, resulting in the arrest of 12 individuals. Among them was Paula White, a former director at Chester City FC. It has been alleged that White was connected to a website that specialized in selling 'legal highs', although it is not yet known if she had direct involvement in the distribution of Mephedrone. Step 4: Highlight the seizure of White's Aston Martin During the raids, police seized several assets from the suspects, including a £120,000 Aston Martin belonging to Paula White. The luxury vehicle, along with other possessions, has been taken by law enforcement as evidence in their ongoing investigation. The seizure of the car represents the seriousness with which authorities are treating this case, and the high-profile nature of those involved. Conclusion: As the investigation continues, the police will be working hard to uncover the full extent of this dangerous drug operation and bring those responsible to justice. Meanwhile, the tragic deaths of the two clubbers serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of Mephedrone and other 'legal highs', emphasizing the need for continued vigilance in the fight against these deadly substances."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

Physical reasoning tasks often require people to apply their knowledge of the real world and physical properties to make predictions, plan strategies, or solve complex situations. Here is a detailed example of a physical reasoning task: Task Name: The Weighted Bridge Challenge Objective: The goal of this task is to safely transport a set of differently weighted objects across a fragile bridge without causing the bridge to collapse. Materials Required: 1. A makeshift bridge (e.g., a plank of wood or a thick piece of cardboard) that can hold a limited amount of weight before collapsing. 2. A set of objects with different weights, such as small sandbags, boxes, or containers filled with varying materials like rice, sand, water, etc. Label each object with its weight for clarity. 3. A weighing scale or a pre-determined weight limit for the bridge. 4. A stopwatch or timer for setting a time limit, if desired. Procedure: 1. Establish the weight limit for the bridge by either testing it beforehand or setting an arbitrary limit. Communicate this limit to the participant. 2. Lay out the differently weighted objects that need to be transported across the bridge. 3. Explain the task to the participant and inform them that they must develop a strategy for safely transporting all the objects across the bridge without exceeding the weight limit and without making multiple trips with the same object. 4. If you'd like to add a competitive element or additional challenge, set a time limit for completing the task. 5. The participant will assess the weights of the objects and the limit of the bridge, and develop their strategy for moving them safely across. As they plan, they will need to mentally manipulate the items and determine their order and configuration, considering factors such as weight, distribution, and balance. The Weighted Bridge Challenge tests a person's ability to perform physical reasoning by requiring them to analyze the situation, estimate and assess weights, understand the physical properties and risks, and develop a strategy to safely transport the objects. This task incorporates problem-solving, logical thinking, and awareness of physics principles, making it a well-rounded test of one's physical reasoning abilities."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer.

Problem:Abstract: We evaluated certain histochemical tests for their ability to detect premalignant mucosa in the dimethylhydrazine model of colonic carcinogenesis. Biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure, rectum, and any visualized tumors were taken. The specimens were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to detect neutral mucins, high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins, fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin, and fluoresceinated Ulex europeus agglutinin. None of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa. However, Ulex europeus agglutinin, which bound to only 3% of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study, bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals, reaching a maximum of 90% positivity by 13-16 wk. Moreover, Ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93% of tumors. Mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum (but not the splenic flexure) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals, but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia. We conclude that Ulex europeus agglutinin binding is a consistent feature of premalignant colonic mucosa in dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?

Levantine Arabic is part of the broader group of dialects known as Eastern Arabic dialects, spoken from Syria to Yemen and Oman. Palestinian Arabic has three main sub-dialects, each distributed in a region of Palestine, including Rural, Urban, and Bedouin. Palestinian Arabic, like other regional Arabic variants, has its own unique characteristics that differentiate it from standard Arabic and other dialects. While the core grammar and vocabulary are still Arabic, there are many specific local words, accents, and dialectical features that make it distinct, and it is heavily influenced by the culture and history of Palestine. The rural dialect in Palestine, often spoken in villages and small towns, tends to be closer to standard Arabic; it retains more classical Arabic features. On the other hand, the urban dialect, which is common in cities like Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, and Nablus, has absorbed influences from different cultures and languages, including Aramaic, Egyptian Arabic, and others. The bedouin dialect is mostly spoken by the tribes living in the Negev desert and the west part of the Dead Sea. Of course, Modern Standard Arabic, the form taught in schools and used in the media and literature, is understood by virtually everyone in Palestine. It's important to understand that this is not necessarily the language used in daily life by average Palestinians. There's often a significant gap between the official, classical language and the colloquial, everyday language used by people on the street. The influence of other languages is also noticeable in Palestinian Arabic, with a significant number of borrowed words from English and Hebrew due to the long periods of interaction and conflict. Additionally, the influence of Turkish and Persian is evident, as a result of the Ottoman rule over Palestine for four centuries. In summary, the type of Arabic spoken in Palestine is Palestinian Arabic, which is a blend of historical, cultural, and regional influences. This dialect, like all Arabic dialects, is unique but rooted in the broader framework of the Arabic language. It shows the rich history and diversity of the people who speak it."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Nicky for the following movie plot: In 1973, sports handicapper and mafia associate Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is sent to Las Vegas to run the Teamsters Union-funded Tangiers Casino on behalf of the Chicago Outfit, which secretly controls the Teamsters, while Philip Green (Kevin Pollak) serves as the mob's frontman.

Do you have any tips for making a small rowhouse particularly \\"open\\" feeling with lots of people around? Thanks as always for your chats, which are a great resource for me. If it's during the day, I would just make sure all of your curtains are drawns, shades and blinds pulled up and shutters open, to get as much natural light in the house as possible. Put some fresh flowers around, too. Otherwise, sounds like you're all set. – May 19, 2011 11:06 AM I have an end row house in NW w/vintage, contemporary and quasi traditional pieces. My one fireplace is in the dinning room with built in cabinets. Above the fireplace, the wall and the wall facing the fireplace is a goldenrod/mustard color. The side walls are off-white. The brick is the original to the 1908 house. What are your thoughts? Also, what are your thoughts on a fireplace in the dinning room and not in the living room. I'm envious of your dining room fireplace! How cozy to eat and entertain in the winter with a fire roaring in the background. My thoughts on what you describe: paint all the walls the same color, built-ins includedm especially if the room is small. – May 19, 2011 11:10 AM Good morning! I have a collection of antique children's ABC plates and some large feather edge platters. I would like to hang them on my dining room wall, but I am concerned that the spirng-loaded hangers might damage the plates. Any suggestions? Many many collectors have used the spring-loaded hangers over the years. I personally have several brown and white transferware platters in my kitchen hung with these gadgets. I would not worry about damaging them. Your collections sounds lovely by the way and what a great way to add your personal style to your room. – May 19, 2011 11:10 AM Not to open this up for discussion again, but I was recently in my cousin's home. She had fake flowers everywhere and I have to say they just did not look good and made the rooms look really fusty. How hard can it be to buy a five dollar bouquet of daisies at the grocery store each week? (If you have the money, of course). I just don't think that fake flowers add anything to a room except clutter. I agree with you. I think they are dust collectors. But plenty of people love them. – May 19, 2011 11:18 AM If you have easy to move furniture, try rearranging the furniture to leave an \\"aisle\\" to allow flow from the front to the back of the house.

Also make sure there is adequate seating so that people have a way to socialize without standing in the walkways. – May 19, 2011 11:19 AM I recently visited some relatives and stayed in a wide range of guest rooms. Of course, I was happy to enjoy everyone's hospitality and so glad they opened their homes to me. But it did make me realize that I need to lie down on my own guest bed to see if the light on the nightstand shines in my eyes when I'm trying to read. And I have to say that I really dislike futons. (BTW, the best guest bedroom was the one with the view of the ocean--awoke each morning and lay in bed watching the waves crash on the shore.) Everyone should make a habit of spending an occasional night in their guest room to make sure it's comfortable and to make note of anything it lacks. Lighting is especially important. – May 19, 2011 11:22 AM And paint the fireplace brick a contrasting color that works with the rest of the decor.

The family says this small room is their most cozy, favorite hangout. – May 19, 2011 11:22 AM I'm thinking, yet again, about paint my family room. The problem is that the space is open from the kitchen, a small dining area and the family room. I want to differentiate the areas without it looking like I've lost a battle with a box of crayolas. Yout don't have to rely on paint to differentiate between the spaces. You can use area rugs, furniture, window treatments, etc. – May 19, 2011 11:24 AM What advice would you give someone that is new (and clueless) with vintage furnishings and markets? It's best to just dive in. Keep in mind that you don't have to comprimise on quality just because it's vintage. For instance, I have a \\"butt\\" test for vintage seating. ALWAYS sit in it before you buy. Look for wobbles and sturdiness in tables. Know what your budget and stick to it.

Try to keep them on bookshelves or on your mantel. – May 19, 2011 11:31 AM I have two matching, floor to ceiling (almost), bookshelves from Restoration Hardware in my dining room. The wood of the shelves and my table is rustic, and reclaimed, ashy colored. What do I put on the shelves? Books seem wrong for a dining room, but my crystal and fine china seems wrong too--too formal for such casual wood and open shelf display. Suggestions, please? (P.S. The shelf height is fixed around 20 inches apart.) Have you ever thought about using your china serving pieces as display instead of your crystal. Platters and bowls look a bit more rustic and substantial than crystal. Make sure to add a bit of texture with faux plants and natural pieces like shells, whatever your theme is. Go ahead and mix in some books to add height and interest. – May 19, 2011 11:32 AM Rather than think the choice is between fake flower and real flowers, how about having a living potted plant (one time cost) if buying fresh flowers every week is not in the budget? Much prettier than fake flowers and comparably priced. Yes! Great suggestion. Thank you. – May 19, 2011 11:33 AM I love flea markets, really I do! But shopping them can be overwhelming because amidst the treasure is, well, a lot of crap. How do you become a discerning shopper and bring home the items you don't regret, but cherish, later? It's best to make a list of the items/furniture you are looking for along with measurements before you leave the house. Make sure to look the piece over carefully before buying it. I have two rules, if you LOVE it, buy it! You will always find room for it. However, if you're not sure, walk AWAY! Don't talk yourself into a piece because it's a good deal. There will always be more stuff to buy! – May 19, 2011 11:35 AM Does anyone have experience with Pantone paints? (Am interested in a specific blue -- Pantone 287). I know there are retailers (Monarch, for one) but do not live near one. The paint is pricey and would love to know if anyone has used it. Terri and I have not used it, but it is a very well respected brand. Anyone out there want to chime in? – May 19, 2011 11:36 AM I saw on one of the HGTV shows, if you want variety for rooms that are visible to each other, select different shades from the same paint chip. You can make the room with the most windows the darkest shade and then use lighter shades for rooms with less natural light. And sometimes the colors look quite different when painted on walls, but they are still complementary. Yes. This is a good idea. Thanks for sharing it. – May 19, 2011 11:36 AM Just adding my 2 cents from what a previous poster said, I just brought a real houseplant for 2.98 at my super Walmart & if taken care of properly will last for yrs. Maybe she should buy her friend a real plant & see how long before she throws out those dust collectors for the real deal. – May 19, 2011 11:37 AM Our guest room has a queen size futon couch. To make it more comfortable, after we replaced our queen size bed, I keep the mattress in the basement and when I am expecting guests, I open the futon, put the mattress from the basement on the futon and then make the bed. Much more comfortable and doesn't cost anything, other than sweat labor to get the mattress back upstairs. If you don't want a full mattress, you can get thick mattress pads (Ikea has some that are like 2 inches thick) that roll up and are easier to maneuver. Very considerate of your overnight guests. – May 19, 2011 11:37 AM As part of our den redo, we plan to buy a flat-screen TV. We're having a hard time finding a cabinet to put it on, and to put the components into. I think the problem is size: We can only accommodate 42 inches of width and don't want a high, armoire type piece.

Separated them out into three vases by keeping the same colors together (a la Martha Stewart's directions). They are just finally dying now. And I didn't have to dust them. Although I will say that I like fake flowers that aren't trying to be real, like the ones made of paper or wood. You make a good point. Buy a mixed bouquet for under 10 and fill a number of vases. I do not personally like paper or wood flowers. – May 19, 2011 11:39 AM We're remodeling our (extremely small) master bathroom in our 1917 home in DC - any suggestions for a design/style direction (e.g. finishes, tile, etc.) to make the space appear larger? Two words: classic and white. – May 19, 2011 11:40 AM I forwarded you a photo of the multi-colored brick of my 1940s house for you to suggest colors for shutters and trim. Currently all white. I also have a front porch with columns. Lots of multi-colored Victorians and Sears craft houses in the neighborhood, so I am tempted to go bold. Terri and I think you should either go with teal blue or a sage green to go with the Craftsman style of your neighborhood. Meanwhile, the best way to see what might look good with your brick is to drive around the neighborhood and look for houses like yours and see what colors they have used. It really helps to visualize the colors and see what strikes you as fun and good looking. – May 19, 2011 11:42 AM Are there any good online places (I'm in Boston) to buy ready made something other than the solid-or-just-faintly-striped-curtains-like-they-have-at-bed-bath-and-beyond at a pretty cheap pricepoint? My rented apartment needs something with pattern and color and summer-ness since I can't paint the white walls and it will apparently never stop raining here. West Elm has nice options. Try Anthropologie, too. – May 19, 2011 11:43 AM Can we please just agree to disagree? Taste is a subjective thing and while you may not like faux plants/flowers, I do for a myriad of reasons. I happen to dislike traditional furniture much more than faux plants, but I don't make it a point to try to dissuade someone who likes it from decorating with it. If you don't like them, don't decorate with them. How about everyone just do what makes them happy in their houses and not care what anyone else thinks. – May 19, 2011 11:45 AM If I have real flowers, my cats will nip at them and pull the vase over, creating a mess. They leave fake flowers alone. I rotate mine for each season and keep them clean. Not to mention, I have a lovely garden outside where I can enjoy fresh flowers. My cat has no interest in cut flowers. Thank goodness! – May 19, 2011 11:48 AM I think you can only give a gift from a thrift store or flea market if you've really put thought into it. If I see extra pieces of a friend's china or glassware or see a horribly wonderful Xmas sweater for a snarky friend, I snatch them up, but I wouldn't give a random, used cookbook as a hostess gift (unless maybe it was out of print, and I knew the hostess was searching for it!). You give really wise advice here. Love the idea of finding a friend's china or glassware pattern. – May 19, 2011 11:49 AM Just wanted to share a few vintage shopping points!

Free swatches. I'm currently drooling over the sheers with dragonflies on them. And I apologize for reopening the fake flowers vs real flowers debate again. Mea culpa. – May 19, 2011 11:54 AM Why is outdoor furniture so expensive? I want to buy a dining set and a small seating set, but it will cost thousands of dollars, it seems. Has anyone found a reasonable place to buy outdoor furniture that has quality options? My last set from Target was beautiful, but faded and rusted. Any unique sources that I would have not yet considered? I feel like I've looked everywhere and to get all of the furniture I want for 1800 or less is impossible. Thanks for any insights that you have to offer! Retail furniture can be expensive! Trying vintage! Look for sound wicker and metal furniture. Make sure to give it a good scrub! Don't skip this step! Use Rust-o-leum (love it) indoor/outdoor spray paint. At least 2 coats! Great seating at a great price! – May 19, 2011 11:54 AM Then there'd be no need for a Home column in the paper, lol!

The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\".

He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia. Diplo was born on November 10, 1978, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. He is of German and English descent. The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape his production style. He spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic Miami bass. He began attending the University of Central Florida in 1997, and then moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at Temple University, where he first garnered attention as a DJ. After frequently running into fellow DJ Low Budget, the two began throwing parties under the Hooked on Hollertronix moniker in 2003 as a way of maintaining control of what they were able to play during DJ gigs in Philadelphia. The success of these parties allowed the two to release mixtapes, both separate and together, gathering acclaim across the country. One such mixtape, Never Scared, was named one of the New York Times top ten albums of 2003, and the Hollertronix name became synonymous with parties featuring guests like Maluca Mala, Bun B, Spank Rock, M.I.A., among others. Hollertronix's sound has been described as \\"disparate genres to be smashed together for maximum attention-grabbing impact\\" an aesthetic which takes from the \\"organic, cohesive, whole\\" aesthetic of acts such as Bun B, Lil Jon, Drama, M.I.A., Bjork, Busta Rhymes, and others. Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, Florida, which was released on the Ninja Tune imprint, Big Dada Records. The album Florida was pressed twice, first with a CD and the second with a CD and DVD. The DVD was created by System D-128, another artist who has collaborated with Diplo on some audio and video projects. Before Florida's DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called Diplo: \\"Banned in Libya\\" which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called \\"Thingamajawn\\" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the Florida DVD, \\"Banned in Libya\\" is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called baile funk, or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (Favela on Blast, Favela Strikes Back), which served to bring the Brazilian dance music of the ghettos to the United States. It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built \\"The Mausoleum,\\" a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia. Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, Boys Noize, Nicos Gun, and more. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did he get his big break?","output":"Diplo got his big break after he started hosting parties with fellow DJ Low Budget under the name Hooked on Hollertronix in 2003.

As BBC Scotland's Kevin Keane explains, it takes a lot of planning to remove the topside, and a whole lot more for the jacket and seabed storage tanks. To do the job, the double-hulled, Swiss-owned Pieter Shelte has recently arrived in the North Sea from South Korea, capable of lifting 48,000 tonnes of topside, and a 25,000 tonne jacket. (Its name, crewing and Panamanian flag are rather less awe-inspiring to the RMT trade union, which points out it is named after a Nazi war criminal). Now, multiply that Brent Delta by 475 other offshore installations, 5,000 wells, 10,000km of pipelines and 15 onshore installations. And more are now being installed east and west of Shetland, which will need removed after a few more decades. I was writing about this big economic opportunity in the world's biggest scrapyard more than four years ago, and about the giant ships being built to lift equipment. When I wrote that, the estimated cost of decommissioning had just risen from £19bn to £27bn. It has most recently been put at £37bn, spread out until 2040. But it has been slow to get started, while the oil price has remained high. Oil & Gas UK, representing the industry, published its projections before the rapid slide in the price of Brent crude, and it reckoned that the £900m spend on decommissioning last year will rise to an annual average of £1.3bn for the rest of this decade, peaking at £1.7bn next year. That schedule may change a lot if fields are becoming less economic. The boss of BP has today said that he's heard, anecdotally, a third of North Sea fields are now running at a loss. BP has confirmed plans to cut back harshly on its capital expenditure plans for this year, down by between £2.6bn and £4bn to less than £14bn. The value of its global reserves has been slashed by £2bn, and those of fellow UK energy company BG Group by £4bn. For these big oil companies, the North Sea is among the more mature and least profitable of basins. In trying to cut costs, at least two companies plan a rota change from working two weeks on and two weeks off, to a three-week turnaround. And where fields are getting old, much more decommissioning could be brought forward. Who gets the work? Teesside seems to be in the lead. Shell intends to send its equipment for breaking up and recycling on a quay at Hartlepool yard. Norwegian yards are also poised to grab a share. The facilities, supply chain and expertise can be found in Scotland, but they appear to be lagging somewhat. The argument that the decommissioning boom will be brought forward depends on that oil price remaining low. Yet it's bouncing back. Having fallen close to 45 last month, it's now trading above 56. \\"People are very, very skittish,\\" according to one trader. If there's one explanation for the rise, it is the self-correcting nature of the oil glut. Oil exporters, led by Saudi Arabia, have kept pumping rather than cutting supply to support price. The price fell. Data published last Friday showed the industry quickly cut back on the number of shale rigs at work in North America. That should feed through to falling supply in about nine months, as pressure runs down in the shale seams. For BP and others, there's less money being put into exploration, and that will feed through to less supply in a few years. It's expected that some expensive fields will be plugged earlier than planned. So taken together, there are lots of reasons why supply will fall. And so the price can be expected to rise again. However, don't expect it to be without bumps along the road. The harsh winter in America is boosting demand for heating oil. There are huge inventories being built up, with marine tankers now being used to store oil in anticipation of a higher price, and that in itself depresses the price. If the price lifts to about 70 per barrel, you can expect those fracking rigs to become viable once more, and they can quickly be put back to work. While the price will surely remain volatile, that seems a more comfortable equilibrium price on which exporting companies can get along with their American competitors. It's unfortunate for the North Sea, meanwhile that the long-term break even point for a significant number of oil fields is above 70. And after this week's Aberdeen summit of oil industry leaders and Scotland's two governments, it's worth remembering that all the talk of tax cuts in next months' Budget may be not only too late, but of little consequence. If oil fields are not profitable, then there is no profit on which to levy tax. Summary:","output":"Royal Dutch Shell is outlining plans to dismantle its Brent field platforms, after enduring nearly 40 years of harsh conditions in the North Sea. Decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure is a complex project requiring significant planning and costs. The Brent field decommissioning process involves the use of the Swiss-owned Pieter Shelte, a double-hulled vessel capable of lifting 48,000 tonnes of topside and a 25,000 tonne jacket. This is only one of the 475 offshore installations, 5,000 wells, 10,000 km of pipelines, and 15 onshore facilities that will require dismantling in the coming years. Decommissioning is estimated to cost around £37 billion, stretched out until 2040. Decommissioning will become more common as oil fields become less profitable. Teesside and Norwegian yards are expected to lead the race in receiving decommissioning work, while Scottish facilities lag behind. The future of decommissioning projects largely depends on oil price fluctuations and the resulting profitability of oil fields."},{"instruction":"ReelTime.com is an Internet-based video on demand provider located in Seattle Washington.

A YouGov UK poll in The Times newspaper showed 48% support for the Conservatives and 24% for Labour. Mr Jones suggested that the primary concern in this campaign is the state of public services in England. He acknowledged that Labour faces significant challenges but noted the party had faced major difficulties in the past.

Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.

The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. Context: The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines. During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown. Question: Was there a population of these cities? Answer:","output":"Yes, there was a population in the cities of the Maya civilization during the Preclassic period. The development of sedentary communities, establishment of settlements, and growth of small villages into cities, as seen with Nakbe, El Mirador, and Tikal, are indications that there were populations inhabiting these cities. These populations engaged in agriculture, cultivating staple crops, and participated in the cultural aspects such as the creation of pottery, fired clay figurines, and the development of the early Maya script."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: the city council of los angeles is expected to hold a discussion next week on whether to endorse a proposed statewide moratorium on digital billboards , which are considered a safety risk to drivers , officials said friday .

Can any one get any government college through MAT? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address completely different topics. Let me break both questions down and explain the subjects they are referring to: Question 1: \\"Can I use the Pac-man character with teeth for my own game?\\" This question is about the legality and copyright issue of using a specific character, the Pac-man, in a personal game project. Steps to address this question: 1. Research the ownership and copyright of the Pac-man character. 2. Determine if there are any licensing options available for using the character. 3. Consult legal resources or professionals to confirm the possibility of using the character in a personal game project without violating copyright. Question 2: \\"Can anyone get any government college through MAT?\\" This question is related to education, specifically asking about the possibility of securing admission in a government college by means of the Management Aptitude Test (MAT) scores. Steps to address this question: 1. Identify the government colleges that accept MAT scores during their admission process. 2. Understand minimum score requirements and other eligibility criteria at the respective colleges. 3. Research the admission process of the selected colleges and prepare accordingly. Since both questions talk about unrelated subjects: one about using a character in their game while the other one about college admissions via an aptitude test, they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"13 Nisan'dan bu yana Balkanlar'daki spor, eğlence ve diğer kültürel etkinliklere genel bakış.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors. Answer:","output":"Poe"},{"instruction":"Where would you find food packaged in MRE's? Options: - fairgrounds - picnic - neighbor's house - supermarket - military base Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"1. MRE's, or Meals Ready-to-Eat, are typically used for military purposes and not commonly found in civilian settings. 2. Fairgrounds and picnics are public events or locations where food is often purchased or prepared individually; MRE's are not likely to be found here. 3. A neighbor's house is unlikely to have MRE's, since they are not standard household food items. 4. Supermarkets primarily sell consumer food products, and MRE's are not typically found on their shelves. 5. Military bases store and distribute MRE's for the personnel, as these meals are designed to be portable, long-lasting, and nutritious for soldiers in the field.

There's a large contraption at the center that appears to be a time machine. Benjamin eagerly shares his invention with Olivia. --- Benjamin: Olivia! I'm so glad you could make it. I have something truly incredible to show you! Olivia: Hey, Benjamin. With all the excitement in your voice, this must be something extraordinary. What do you have there? Benjamin: You see that machine right there at the center of the room? That, my dear friend, is the world's first fully-functioning time machine. Just imagine the possibilities! Olivia: Wow! I've always been fascinated by time travel theories, but never have I thought I'd actually encounter a time machine. How does it work? Benjamin: It relies on a combination of quantum mechanics and advanced engineering to warp the fabric of spacetime. By manipulating this fabric, we can move forward or backward in time, within the confines of this very machine. Olivia: That sounds astounding, yet hard to believe. Have you tested it? Benjamin: Yes, I've done a few tests, and the results have been remarkable. I traveled to the future and witnessed some mind-boggling technological advancements. Of course, I didn't go too far. I didn't want to spoil the surprise or alter the course of history. Olivia: This sounds almost too good to be true. But isn't time travel dangerous? What if you create a paradox, or worse, disrupt the space-time continuum? Benjamin: While those are valid concerns, I've carefully designed the machine to minimize any potential risks. I've spent countless hours studying temporal physics to make sure we can navigate time safely. Of course, there's always room for uncertainties, but that's the nature of any scientific endeavor! Olivia: I'm absolutely taken aback by your achievement. But tell me, what do you plan to do with this newly-acquired power? Benjamin: The applications are vast. Initially, I want to explore historical events, confirm the accuracy of our records, and perhaps solve some age-old mysteries. But on a larger scale, the ability to experience firsthand the significant events of the past could provide us with valuable insights to navigate our present and create a better future. Olivia: I agree, the past holds lessons that can help us understand our world now. But there's something that keeps bothering me - the ethical aspect, I mean. Who decides which events to venture into? How do we ensure that we don't exploit this potent knowledge? Benjamin: You do have a point. Responsible time travel would indeed require strict ethical guidelines. I'm hoping that by involving a group of trustworthy experts, we can collaboratively address these questions and create a framework for responsible exploration. I'd be more than happy to include you in that team, Olivia. Olivia: I appreciate the offer, and I must admit, I'm curious to see how this develops. It's truly a groundbreaking discovery that might redefine our relationship with time. I'll consider your proposal and let you know soon. Benjamin: That's wonderful to hear! I understand the significance of this project, and I'm glad to have you with me on this mind-bending journey. Together, we'll tread carefully through the annals of time and reshape humanity's understanding of its past—and maybe even its future. --- With Olivia intrigued but unsure, Benjamin and she begin a fascinating journey exploring the mysteries of time.

Ask people to speak directly and honestly to you without using sarcasm. When you speak with others, put most of your energy on listening to what they say and understanding them. If you're unclear about something, ask a question. Overall, be curious in your interactions and avoid jumping to conclusions. If you start to doubt what the person is doing or saying, ask a question. However, don't be accusing. For example, if your partner is going out and you're feeling suspicious, ask, “Do you know what time you'll be back? I was hoping we could spend some time together tonight.” If you generally tend to be untrusting toward people, this likely affects your ability to have friendships and relationships. While it's true some people shouldn't be trusted, it doesn't mean that everyone is not trustworthy. Think about what it costs you when you doubt someone; their time, their presence, their love, and perhaps even their friendship. For example, if someone calls and says they will be late, then it simply means they are running late and nothing more. Even if there is a pattern of lateness, it doesn't mean they're up to something else based solely on this one trait, however much you dislike it. If you're having a hard time believing someone, say to yourself, “I am choosing to believe they are telling me the truth.” Maybe an ex cheated on you and now you're wary of dating or being with someone new for fear they may also betray you. Living in the past is not a healthy way to direct your present and future behavior. Avoid letting past bad experiences cloud your present judgment, and learn how to stop yourself from falling into automatic suspicious responses whenever a similar situation arises. Rebuilding trust starts with you, not anybody else. Learn from your past experiences and improve your resilience, but use the past like a stepping stone rather than a weight dragging you down. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of good communication skills and trust in maintaining healthy relationships. It suggests practicing active listening, asking direct questions, and being curious in interactions to avoid jumping to conclusions. The article also encourages individuals to recognize the costs of doubting others and to not let past bad experiences cloud present judgment. Building trust and overcoming insecurities in relationships require personal growth, learning from past experiences, and focusing on the present."},{"instruction":"Orlando City SC were an American professional soccer team based in Orlando, Florida, United States that was the precursor to Orlando City SC. The team played in USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer pyramid from 2010 to 2014, until discontinuing in favor of Orlando's Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise in 2015 which is owned by the same principals. Can we draw the following conclusion? Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Orlando City SC was dissolved in 2015. The team initially known as Orlando City Soccer Club, played in the USL Pro, which was the third tier of the American soccer pyramid from 2010 to 2014. Orlando City SC was the precursor to the Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise, which was established in Orlando in 2015. The founders and ownership group behind Orlando City SC had ambitions to bring professional soccer to a higher level, and they saw the MLS as the right platform for this goal. The MLS launched an expansion initiative in the early 2010s, and Orlando City SC actively pursued a spot in the top-tier league. The ownership group, led by Flavio Augusto da Silva and Phil Rawlins, worked diligently to secure the necessary financial and political commitments, including plans for a new soccer-specific stadium in downtown Orlando. Eventually, the efforts of the ownership group paid off. In November 2013, MLS Commissioner Don Garber announced that Orlando City SC would become the league's 21st franchise, set to begin its first MLS season in 2015. The transition from USL Pro to MLS meant radical changes to the organization, including a new team roster and a rebranding effort in terms of identity and team colors. This rebranding marked the end of the previous Orlando City SC and led to the birth of the new MLS franchise team under the same name. Therefore, with the ambitions of playing in the top-tier league being realized through the establishment of the Major League Soccer expansion franchise, the previous version of Orlando City SC that had competed in the USL Pro from 2010 to 2014 no longer existed and was effectively dissolved in 2015. The current Orlando City SC that plays in the MLS is structurally different from the earlier version, although the name and some core elements have been retained in order to maintain continuity and build upon the growing fan base and soccer community in Orlando."},{"instruction":"After his cousin Joe dies , Layne Vassimer and his girlfriend Macy , along with their friends Stephen , Maurice , Iris and Katrina , decide to clean up Joe's house with the intention of selling it .

Here is a hypothesis: The UAW members at Caterpillar learned nothing. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the given premise, it is essential to analyze the structure and logical relationship between both statements. Let's first break down the premise and hypothesis to understand them better. Premise: \\"As the UAW (United Auto Workers) members at Caterpillar have learned, if the stakes are high enough, Wall Street can be very, very patient.\\" - This statement suggests that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned that Wall Street can display immense patience when the stakes are high. Hypothesis: \\"The UAW members at Caterpillar learned nothing.\\" - This statement contradicts the premise and implies that the UAW members at Caterpillar have not learned anything. In the context of logical reasoning, a conclusion can be derived when the premise leads to or supports the validity of the hypothesis. In this case, we can observe that the premise and the hypothesis are in direct opposition to each other. The premise affirms that the UAW members at Caterpillar have learned about Wall Street's patience, while the hypothesis negates this idea by claiming that they have learned nothing. Given the contradictory nature of the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. In fact, if we assume the premise to be accurate, it inherently rejects the hypothesis. In other words, if it is true that the UAW members at Caterpillar learned about Wall Street's patience, it cannot also be correct that they learned nothing."},{"instruction":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

The experience of driving on a beautiful, picturesque road surrounded by natural landscapes such as mountains, forests, or coastlines can be therapeutic for some people, helping them unwind and escape their daily routine. There are a few reasons behind this calming effect: 1. Engaging the senses: A scenic drive stimulates the senses, as the person can visually take in the stunning views and landscapes, smell the fresh air, and listen to the sounds of nature. This engagement of multiple senses can help a person feel more grounded and present in the moment, which contributes to relaxation. 2. Reduced mental clutter: When driving on a scenic route, one can focus on the beauty of the surroundings without being distracted by the noise and clutter of urban landscapes. This reduction of visual and auditory stressors can help a person clear their mind and achieve a sense of mental tranquility. 3. Personal enjoyment: For many people, driving can be an enjoyable and even meditative activity. When that activity is combined with scenic beauty, the pleasure of the experience is amplified, leading to an overall reduction in stress and increased relaxation. 4. Connection to nature: Humans have an inherent connection to nature, and being surrounded by it can have a positive impact on physical and mental wellbeing. A scenic drive allows individuals to reconnect with the natural world, which can help to reduce stress and anxiety, promote relaxation, and boost mood. 5. An opportunity to reflect: A scenic drive provides the perfect opportunity for quiet reflection and self-exploration, as the calm and serene surroundings give the person the space to think deeply about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, ultimately promoting relaxation. In summary, a scenic drive along a beautiful highway offers a unique, multifaceted experience that engages the senses, allows for personal connection, and promotes relaxation. A break from the hustle and bustle of daily life, driving through scenic landscapes can provide much-needed stress relief and mental clarity for many individuals, making \\"relaxation\\" the most suitable answer in this context."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Nothing I can think of. I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess.

The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.

The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

Regarding the follow-up sentence, it seems to be contradictory with the provided information. The initial text establishes that the Armour School District 21-1 has an elementary school, middle school, and high school. It does not provide any information on the existence of additional schools within the district that may or may not have these levels of education.

In fact, the premise suggests the opposite. Let's examine this in greater detail by breaking it down into key components and analyzing their implications on service quality. 1. Increase in Postal Density: The premise states that there is an increase in postal density. Postal density can be defined as the number of postal items processed or delivered within a unit area, such as households served or geographical regions covered. An increase in postal density implies that the postal system is processing more postal items within that specified area. 2. Reduction in Quality of Service: The premise connects the increase in postal density with a \\"reduction in the quality of service.\\" This implies that, with a higher postal density, the postal system may face challenges in maintaining its standard level of service quality. The reasoning behind this could be that higher postal density puts increased strain on resources, such as personnel and infrastructure, resulting in potential for bottlenecks, delays and other challenges in providing timely and efficient postal services. 3. Incompatibility with Universal Service Obligations: Universal Service Obligations (USO) are the fundamental rules and provisions that postal service providers must adhere to, in order to ensure their services are accessible, affordable and meet a certain standard for all customers. The premise suggests that the reduction in quality of service due to an increase in postal density may not be compatible with these obligations. This could mean that the postal system would be struggling to provide adequate service to customers in line with defined USOs, as a result of increased postal density. Considering these key points, the premise suggests that an increase in postal density would lead to a decline in the quality of postal services, which would not be in accordance with the universal service obligations defined in a country. This contradicts the hypothesis that an increase in postal density would result in an improvement in service quality. The given premise presents that with higher postal density, it becomes increasingly challenging for postal systems to maintain or improve their service quality while adhering to their universal service obligations."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: With wood chippers Type PC942P and PC942PI with the patentpendingTotalSystem we have taken a major step in producing a machine that makes uniform chips for direct use in automatic stokers and pellet furnaces with no prior sorting of the wood","output":"With wood chippers, Type PC942P and PC942PI, with the patent-pending Total System, we have taken a major step in producing a machine that makes uniform chips for direct use in automatic stokers and pellet furnaces with no prior sorting of the wood.

We investigated the roles of the uncoupling proteins (UCPs) UCPI, -2, and -3 in a murine model of cachexia, the MAC16 adenocarcinoma. Weight fell to 24% below that of non-tumor-bearing controls (P < 0.01) 18 days after MAC16 inoculation, with significant reductions in fat-pad mass (-67%; P < 0.01) and muscle mass (-20%; P < 0.01). Food intake was 26-60% lower (P < 0.01) than in controls on days 17-18. Non-tumor-bearing mice, pair-fed to match MAC16-induced hypophagia, showed less weight loss (10% below controls, P < 0.01; 16% above MAC-16, P < 0.01) and smaller decreases in fat-pad mass (21% below controls, P < 0.01). Core temperature in MAC16 mice was significantly lower (-2.4 degrees C, P < 0.01) than in controls, and pair-feeding had no effect. MAC16 mice showed significantly higher UCP1 mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) than in controls (+63%, P < 0.01), and pair-feeding had no effect. UCP2 and -3 expression in BAT did not differ significantly between groups. By contrast, UCP2 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle were comparably increased in both MAC16 and pair-fed groups (respectively, 183 and 163% above controls; both, P < 0.05), with no significant difference between these two groups. Similarly, UCP3 mRNA was significantly higher than controls in both MAC16 (+163%, P < 0.05) and pair-fed (+253%, P < 0.01) groups, with no significant difference between the two experimental groups. Overexpression of UCP1 in BAT in MAC16-bearing mice may be an adaptive response to hypothermia, which is apparently induced by tumor products; increased thermogenesis in BAT could increase total energy expenditure and, thus, contribute to tissue wasting. Increased UCP2 and -3 expression in muscle are both attributable to reduced food intake and may be involved in lipid utilization during lipolysis in MAC16-induced cachexia..

U.S. hacks computers in China, NSA leaker Snowden tells paper.","output":"Title: The NSA Surveillance Controversy: EU Concerns, Public Opinion, and Denials Introduction The National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance practices have been a matter of controversy and debate since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013. Recently, an EU commissioner has raised concerns about the targeting of European citizens, while a Gallup poll highlights the divisive opinions of Americans regarding Snowden's actions. Amidst denials from the NSA chief that the agency can tap any U.S. phone, Snowden has also claimed that the United States hacks computers in China. In this article, we address these key points and explore their implications. Body 1. EU Concerns: U.S. Targeting European Citizens A European Union commissioner is keen to ascertain whether the United States purposefully targeted European citizens through its surveillance programs. This concern is based on the far-reaching surveillance network the American security agency seemingly possesses. Furthermore, evidence of such potential breaches could severely impact diplomatic relations between the two international entities and prompt the EU to take appropriate action. As a result, the EU seeks to investigate these allegations and protect its citizens' privacy rights. 2. Gallup Poll: Americans Split Over Snowden's Actions The wide-ranging effects of Edward Snowden's revelations have left Americans with divided opinions. A recent Gallup poll found that the country is almost equally split over whether Snowden's actions were justified. These differing opinions not only highlight the complexity of the NSA surveillance controversy but also raise crucial questions about the fine line between protecting national security and individual privacy. As it stands, the debate on Edward Snowden's actions continues to be a hot topic within the United States. 3. NSA Chief's Denial: Rejecting Claims of Unrestrained Phone Tapping Despite the widespread outrage towards NSA surveillance practices, the agency's chief has firmly denied allegations that the NSA possesses the ability to tap any U.S. phone. According to official statements, the agency operates under stringent legal constraints and only carries out surveillance when necessary to protect national security. The NSA chief's rebuttal highlights the significance of accurate information and is intended to mitigate concerns over the indiscriminate surveillance of American citizens. 4. U.S. Hacks Computers in China: Snowden's Additional Claims Edward Snowden's revelations do not only concern the United States' domestic actions. The NSA whistleblower has also claimed that the U.S. government actively hacks computers in China, potentially further straining diplomatic relations. These allegations, if proven true, may have significant repercussions on the complex world of cyber security and diplomacy. As nations continue to grapple with the ethical considerations associated with espionage and surveillance, Snowden's claims serve as a stark reminder of the global reach of powerful intelligence agencies. Conclusion The NSA surveillance controversy probes deep into ethical questions concerning privacy, national security, and geopolitical relationships. With ongoing concerns from the EU commissioner, contradictory opinions from American citizens, denials from the NSA chief, and revelations about U.S. hacking activities in China, the debate surrounding the NSA's surveillance practices remains as relevant and pressing as ever. As technology continues to progress and shape the landscape of global intelligence, questions of accountability, transparency, and restraint will inevitably persist."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: And William Martinez, 28, who cut his medical school studies short because he couldn't afford the 39,000 in loans after two years of graduate school and four years of college.

These changes are referred to as phase transitions, and they cause water to take on different forms, including solid, liquid, and gas. The other options provided, such as \\"melts\\", \\"wet clothes\\", \\"move mountains\\", and \\"thin blood\\", do not directly relate to the question of what happens to water at different temperatures. At various temperature ranges, water can: 1. Freeze: When the temperature drops below the freezing point (0 °C or 32 °F), liquid water turns into ice, a crystalline solid. This phase transition is called freezing or solidification. 2. Melt: When the temperature rises above the melting point (0 °C or 32 °F), ice (solid) turns back into liquid water. This phase transition is called melting. 3. Evaporate: When the temperature increases and reaches water's boiling point (100 °C or 212 °F at sea level), liquid water turns into water vapor, a gas. At temperatures below the boiling point, water can still evaporate, albeit at a slower rate. Evaporation is the process in which molecules on the surface of the liquid absorb energy and escape into the air as a gas. 4. Condense: When water vapor, a gas, cools down to a temperature below its dew point, it turns back into liquid water. This phase transition is called condensation. 5. Sublimate: In some cases, under specific conditions of temperature and pressure, water can go directly from the solid phase (ice) to the gas phase (water vapor) without becoming a liquid first. This process is called sublimation. 6. Deposit: Similarly, under certain conditions, water vapor can transition directly to its solid form (ice) without passing through the liquid phase. This process is called deposition. In summary, water can take on several forms, including solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor), depending on the temperature. These phase transitions make \\"take several forms\\" the most appropriate answer choice to the question."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1] Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5] Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.

Gary Herbert speaks during an interview in Salt Lake City. The Utah governor is considering whether to sign a bill that would make Utah the first state to require... (Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The governor has signed a bill that makes Utah the first state to require doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later. The bill signed by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert Monday is based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. \\"The governor is adamantly pro-life. He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child,\\" Herbert spokesman Jon Cox said. Many doctors in Utah and across the country are concerned that the requirement could increase the health risks to women by giving them unnecessary heavy sedation in order to protect a fetus from pain that it may or may not feel. Dr. Sean Esplin of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah said anesthesia or an analgesic would need to go through the woman in order to reach the fetus. Doctors could give a woman general anesthesia, which would make her unconscious and likely require a breathing tube, or a heavy dose of narcotics. No other U.S. state has passed this same law, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the abortion-rights nonprofit Guttmacher Institute. Montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries, including abortions, performed after 20 or more weeks of gestation, but its Democratic governor vetoed the measure. Twelve states ban abortions after around 20 weeks of gestation, while a handful of other states give women the option of having anesthesia. Previous Utah law gave women the choice to have anesthesia during an abortion. The new law by Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, targets a small subset of women who have elective abortions beginning at 20 weeks. State law normally allows abortions until viability, which is at about 22 weeks. But it could affect women in many other medical situations. Utah law defines abortions in part as \\"the intentional termination or attempted termination of human pregnancy after implantation of a fertilized ovum through a medical procedure carried out by a physician or through a substance used under the direction of a physician.\\" David Turok of the University of Utah's obstetrics and gynecology department said that could apply to instances in which a woman is past her due date so the doctor induces labor or there's a problem with the pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia, so it's safer to deliver the baby early. These common procedures could now require general anesthesia, he said. \\"You never give those medicines if you don't have to,\\" Turok said. Laura Bunker of the conservative group United Families International said if there is any chance a fetus feels pain at 20 weeks, doctors should do everything possible to make sure they are comfortable. The new law would not apply to women who must have an abortion because their life is at risk or the fetus will not survive outside the womb. Utah Medical Association CEO Michelle McOmber said her organization feels neutral toward the legislation. The association convinced Bramble to change its language from saying a fetus \\"is capable of experiencing pain,\\" to it \\"may be capable of experiencing pain.\\" She said the association would have preferred that the proposal stated it is inconclusive whether or not the fetus feels pain. Bramble initially sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks entirely, but he changed course after the Legislature's attorneys warned him that any such measure would likely be unconstitutional. ||||| Weeks after last menstruation Usually when fetus is deemed viable When fetus is considered full term Fertilization 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ... 36 37 38 39 40 Mississippi’s law is based on the fetal pain assertion.

This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion. Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks’ gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005. Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks’ gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony. Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures. ||||| Gov. Gary Herbert (R-Utah) signed a bill that makes Utah the first state to mandate anesthesia use in abortions at 20 weeks or later. Supporters say it prevents the fetus from pain, but some decry the evidence as unfounded and say it could complicate procedures. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) A woman in Utah is allowed to have an abortion at 20 weeks. But does she have to give her fetus painkillers in the process? Yes, the state said Monday, when it became the only state in the nation to require doctors to give anesthesia to women undergoing abortions at 20 weeks or later. Advocates of the law say that the regulation prevents fetuses from suffering during abortions. But doctors in Utah and elsewhere say there’s no proof that fetuses are able to feel anything at that point in pregnancy, and that sedating women during the procedure puts them at risk of complications. “You’re now mandating [women] take that risk, based on inconclusive and biased evidence. You don’t understand what you’re legislating,” Dr. Sean Esplin, a doctor with Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, testified at committee hearing on the bill earlier this month. The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Curt Bramble (R-Provo), said he initially hoped to ban abortions after 20 weeks, but he was told that such a law would probably challenged on constitutional grounds. This measure was next best option, he told the Salt Lake Tribune; it requires doctors to take steps to “eliminate or alleviate organic pain to the unborn child” except for in cases when the abortion is necessary to prevent the health of the mother, when the fetus suffers from a deadly congenital defect, or when the administration of anesthetic might put the mother at risk. “In this quote ‘medical procedure,’ let’s call it what it is. It’s killing babies. And if we’re going to kill that baby, we ought to protect it from pain,” Bramble said. This is a new twist on an old argument: For years, antiabortion advocates have used the fetal pain argument to justify bans on abortion 20 weeks after conception. According to the National Right to Life Committee, “pain-capable unborn protection” laws are currently on the books in 12 states (though they’re being challenged in two). But the idea that 20-week-old fetuses can feel anything is disputed; a 2005 review of more than 300 studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester (28 weeks). Utah generally does not allow abortions after the point of viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. Esplin told the Associated Press that the new law means that any anesthetic or analgesic will have to be administered to the mother; women having abortions will either be placed under general anesthesia — meaning they’re unconscious and hooked up to a breathing tube — or sedated with a heavy dose of narcotics. Previously, women were given a choice to be anesthetized. General anesthesia carries its own side effects and risks, and doctors say they try to avoid it except in cases where it’s absolutely necessary. “You never give those medicines if you don’t have to,” David Turok of the University of Utah’s obstetrics and gynecology department told the AP. Turok and some lawmakers have expressed concern that the rule could be interpreted as mandating that pregnant women be anesthetized for all procedures that happen after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Utah law defines abortions as “the intentional termination or attempted termination of human pregnancy” through a medical procedure carried out by or ordered by a physician — loosely interpreted, that could include instances of induced labor, such as when a woman is past her due date. State Sen. Brian Shiozawa (R-Cottonwood Heights), who is also an emergency room doctor, told the Deseret News earlier this month that if the law was passed, “you can forget natural birth and labor” because there’s probably pain to a fetus coming down the birth canal as well. In an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, Shiozawa said he is “all for” changing the statutes on abortion. But this bill, he added, was “cumbersome” for women and their doctors. The new law makes Utah the only state in the country where women must undergo anesthesia to have an abortion. The Montana legislature passed a similar law last year, but it was vetoed by the state’s democratic governor Steve Bullock. Utah’s governor, Gary Herbert (R), who signed the bill into law Monday, said last month that rather than get into a debate about abortion, he just wanted to address the question: “If we’re going to have abortion, what is the most humane way to do it?” “Fetuses have a heartbeat after about five weeks. And the idea of just being callous about that should cause all of humanity concern” regardless of their stance on abortion, he continued. Though the new law is controversial, its impact will likely be limited, Karrie Galloway, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Utah, told the Salt Lake Tribune. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, only 17 Utah women had abortions after 20 weeks. Planned Parenthood is the only provider in the state that provides abortions during the window covered by the law. But Galloway said the idea that lawmakers with no medical knowledge are dictating what women and their doctors can do “is what’s infuriating.” “I mean, we have fetal medical specialists speaking and they were discounted by a citizen who said, ‘I read it on the Internet and therefore it must be true,'” she said. “That’s how we do policy here in Utah.” ||||| Thie March 10, 2016 file photo Utah Gov.

Gary Herbert signed a bill that requires doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion 20 weeks into their pregnancy or later — the first law of its kind in the USA. Among other provisions, SB 0234 requires doctors who perform abortions to administer an anesthetic on women who are at least 20 weeks pregnant, suggesting it would reduce or eliminate pain a fetus may be feeling. \\"The governor is adamantly pro-life,\\" said Jon Cox, spokesman for the Republican governor, in an emailed statement. \\"He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child.\\" At the center of the debate in the Legislature was the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point.

Curt Bramble (R), the legislation's sponsor. \\"I think the message is clear that abortion is an abomination.\\" In this March 2, 2014, file photo, Sen.

Utah's Senate on Friday, March 4, 2016, will debate a proposal that would require doctors to administer anesthesia before an abortion performed after 20 weeks gestation, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. State law currently gives women the choice to have anesthesia for the fetus to reduce potential pain during abortion. Anesthesia would be mandatory under the legislation sponsored by Republican Sen. Curt Bramble. (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP) Unlike several states, Utah does not ban abortions, but it has several provisions that pro-choice advocates say complicate the process for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies. A woman looking to get an abortion must get counseling in person before making the final decision and then wait 72 hours before getting the procedure done. Public funding is available for abortion in cases of rape, incest or when necessary to save the woman or prevent long-lasting damage to her physical health, according to the abortion-rights nonprofit the Guttmacher Institute. The state Senate amended the bill before passing it earlier this month to make sure the anesthesia was not mandated in cases where it could hurt the mother. Many doctors in Utah and throughout the country are concerned that the plan could pose a risk to women because fetal anesthesia is unnecessary. “You’re telling women that they have to have something that’s going to increase their risk based on a conclusion that is not true,” Dr. Sean Esplin of Intermountain Healthcare in Utah told the Associated Press. But supporters of the law say a fetus should be protected if there’s even a chance it can feel pain. Bramble believes the evidence suggesting a fetus can feel pain by 20 weeks outweighs opponents' arguments. The law makes sense in Utah, he said, where convicts sentenced to death and animals facing euthanasia receive anesthetics. \\"We go to extraordinary lengths in Utah to prevent the pain of an individual sentenced to death,\\" he said. \\"With euthanasia, we make every effort to not inflict pain on that animal....(mandating anesthesia) it is consistent with other policies we have in the state of Utah.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MxfXsS ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Utah has become the first US state to require doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later; the bill is based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point.

A: Answer:","output":"The part of a plant that protects the plant cell, maintains its shape, and prevents excessive uptake of water is called the cell wall. The cell wall is a rigid, semi-permeable, and non-living structure that surrounds the plant cell, providing mechanical support and maintaining cellular integrity. It is composed of complex carbohydrates, mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, as well as a small amount of proteins. These components are organized in a network-like structure, giving the cell wall its strength and flexibility. The primary functions of the cell wall in plant cells include: 1. Protection: The cell wall serves as a physical barrier against external factors such as mechanical stress, pathogens, and herbivores. It safeguards the delicate and sensitive cytoplasmic components, helping plants resist damage and infections. 2. Structural support: One of the main roles of the cell wall is to provide mechanical support and maintain the shape of plant cells. The rigidity of the cell wall, particularly in combination with the pressure exerted by the central vacuole, allows plant cells to maintain their shape, resist compression, and grow upright, even under the weight of the plant itself. 3. Regulation of water uptake: The cell wall plays a vital role in controlling the amount of water that enters the cell through a process known as osmosis. The semi-permeable nature of the cell wall ensures that only a certain amount of water can be absorbed by the plant cell, thus preventing excessive uptake of water that could cause the cell to burst. This regulation of water uptake also helps to maintain the turgor pressure inside the cell, which is crucial for its proper functioning and growth. 4. Cell expansion and growth: As plant cells grow, their cell walls must expand accordingly to accommodate the increasing size and volume. The cell wall is dynamic and can be modified through the actions of various enzymes that break and re-form the bonds between the wall components, allowing the cell wall to stretch as the cell grows. This ability to expand is essential for plant cell growth, elongation, and differentiation. 5. Cell-to-cell communication and adhesion: The cell wall also plays a role in cell-to-cell communication and adhesion, enabling the exchange of nutrients and signaling molecules between adjacent plant cells. Channels called plasmodesmata span across the cell walls and connect the cytoplasm of neighboring cells, facilitating this cell-to-cell communication. In summary, the plant cell wall is a dynamic and essential structure that supports, protects, and regulates plant cells, assisting with various functions such as maintaining cellular integrity, controlling water uptake, facilitating growth, and enabling cell-to-cell communication. Its unique composition and organization allow it to perform these critical roles and contribute to the overall growth and development of plants."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you are given a statement and an explanation giving you further knowledge about an entity in the statement.

Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) . - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

Usage: In the example tweet, the user is ironically asking what PTI does apart from \\"whining\\". This question is intended to imply that PTI only whines, which is a form of irony due to the speaker's inverted intent. Thus, the tweet would be labeled as \\"polarity\\". Part #3: Label the tweets based on the irony they have. Usage: Look at the previous step where we identify the kind of irony. In this case, the tweet was labeled as \\"polarity\\" because it represents an instance where irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Part #4: Consider \\"situational\\" irony. Usage: If a tweet read \\"I can’t wait to be stuck in rush hour traffic!\\" This would be situational irony because the situation defies expectations (people don't usually look forward to traffic). Part #5: Consider \\"other\\" types of irony. Usage: If a tweet said something like \\"How beautiful this deserted wasteland is!\\" it may be neither polarity irony nor situational. It could be considered dramatic irony, for instance. This wouldn't fit into the two previous categories and thereby would be labeled as \\"other\\".

Tripoli, with its metropolitan area, has a population of about 1.1 million people. The city is located in the northwestern part of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean and forming a bay. Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks. - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions. - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake. - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war . - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes. - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron. - George Downie (19 January 1778 11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies.

The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance. He retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary... What object entity has the relation of 'military rank' with the subject 'thomas macdonough'?

By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames.

Jan. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., whose skill at hyping new products helped make it the world’s most valuable technology company, became a victim of its own success after a botched introduction of its iPhone 4S in China led it to suspend sales. Would-be customers who waited overnight as temperatures dropped below minus 9 degrees Celsius reacted with fury after the company’s main store in Beijing’s Sanlitun district failed to open. The company sold out of the handsets at stores that did open and later halted sales of all iPhones at its five retail outlets in the country “for the time being,” spokeswoman Carolyn Wu said by phone. Apple had advertised that the store would open at 7 a.m. At 7:15 a.m., people began chanting “Open the door!” and “Liars!” after an unidentified man said over a bullhorn that the phone wouldn’t go on sale today, without giving an explanation. The store stayed closed “for safety reasons,” Wu said. Beijing police temporarily cordoned off the shop after it was pelted with eggs by the crowd. “This is a debacle,” Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group, a Shanghai-based retail advising company, said in a phone interview today. “Everybody knows there will be massive numbers of people when Apple has this kind of a launch. This shows very poor retail management ability.” ‘Very Angry’ Elsewhere in the capital, the introduction went more smoothly. At Apple’s store in the Xidan neighborhood, the company handed out 1,000 tickets good for the purchase of a maximum two iPhone 4S handsets each. In Shanghai, a store in the Pudong district opened an hour early to accommodate the waiting crowds before selling out of the phones immediately. “I’m very angry,” said Li Yun, 59, a retiree who said she tried to buy the device on behalf of her daughter at the People’s Square store in Shanghai. “They had said they would start selling the iPhone 4S at 7 a.m. but I was told they were already sold out by the time I got here at 6 a.m.” About 60 migrant workers, hired by resellers to line up last night outside Apple’s store in Beijing’s Xidan, weren’t paid the 120 yuan (19) they were promised because they failed to get an iPhone 4S after the 12-hour wait, according to several of them, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. They came by bus from a labor market in the suburbs and received only a 10-yuan food allowance, they said. Expansion Slowed The crush of crowds at the stores is a reflection of the company’s decision to slow the opening of outlets in China, Rein said. Apple in February 2010 announced a plan for 25 stores in China over two years, then slowed the expansion. Including the Hong Kong shop, which started selling the iPhone 4s on Nov. 11, there are six in the country. “There isn’t enough product in enough retail points,” Rein said. “If they had more points of sale, it would disperse the crowds.” Hundreds of people lined up outside the store in Hong Kong’s IFC Mall for several nights when the new iPhone went on sale, prompting police to use metal barricades to keep order. Apple has more than 300 outlets worldwide and planned to sell the latest iPhone model through its three stores in Shanghai, two in Beijing, the two main cities in the world’s largest mobile-phone market. Second-Largest Market The Cupertino, California-based company sold 5.6 million iPhones in China in the first nine months of last year, giving it a 10.4 percent share of the smartphone market in the third quarter, according to research company Gartner Inc. Apple’s Wu earlier declined to comment on the outlook for iPhone 4S sales in China. Apple’s stores in China generate the highest traffic and highest revenue of any of the company’s stores in the world, on average, Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said last January. The maker of Macintosh computers and the iPad tablet increased its revenue in China to 13 billion in the year ended Sept. 24, from 3 billion a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in October. China accounted for 16 percent of Apple’s revenue in the fiscal fourth-quarter, making it the company’s biggest national market after the U.S. Foxconn Suicides Today’s confrontation wasn’t the first during a product introduction at the Sanlitun store, which opened in 2008 as Apple’s first in the country. In May, the store was temporarily closed when a group that lined up outside to buy the iPad 2 “became unruly,” Wu of Apple said at the time. Four people were injured and a glass door to the shop was smashed, the China Daily reported. The violence adds to challenges for Apple in China, where company supplier Foxconn Technology Group was hit by a series of employee suicides. The Taipei-based company installed safety nets on buildings, raised pay and hired counselors in 2010 after at least 10 workers killed themselves. Apple also commissioned a review by a team of suicide-prevention experts. China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest carrier, is the only one of the country’s three service providers offering the iPhone with a service contract. The company sent a text message to subscribers trumpeting free home delivery of the new handset through its online store. Yellow Bulls “Buy the iPhone 4S without lining up!” China Unicom said in a text sent to subscribers in Beijing. Unicom’s online shop made the device available at midnight, the text said. While Apple suspended iPhone 4s sales at its China shops, the handsets remain available on its website as well as from Unicom and resellers, Wu said. Sophia Tso, a spokeswoman at China Unicom in Hong Kong, didn’t immediately reply to messages left by phone and e-mail seeking comment. The Unicom site lists the 16-gigabyte model for 5,880 yuan (932), with different levels of subsidies. The handset is free to users committing to a three-year plan for 286 yuan a month or a two-year plan costing 386 yuan a month, the website said. The crowd around Apple’s main Beijing store diminished after police lifted the cordon and the doors remained closed. Some waited a while longer for a chance to buy the phone, which includes voice recognition software that doesn’t work with Mandarin, before giving up. “We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees,” Wu said. The fracas outside the store was caused by yellow bulls, a euphemism for people who buy the phones for sale at a markup, Tony Si, an 18-year-old bartender, said outside the store. The disorder, police response and store closing was their fault, not Apple’s, though he is still disappointed, he said. “I’m angry because they said they’d sell it, and now they aren’t selling it,” Si said. --Edmond Lococo, with assistance from Margaret Conley and Stephanie Wong in Shanghai, Shiyin Chen in Singapore, Feifei Shen and Bloomberg News in Beijing and Mark Lee in Hong Kong.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) (Associated Press) Apple reacted to the scuffle by postponing iPhone 4S sales in its mainland China stores to protect the safety of customers and employees. It said the phone still will be sold online and through its local carrier. Customers including migrant workers hired by scalpers in teams of 20 to 30 to buy iPhones for resale at a markup to Chinese gadget fans waited overnight in freezing weather at the Apple store in Beijing's east side Sanlitun district. The crowd erupted after the store failed to open on schedule at 7 a.m. Some threw eggs and shouted at employees through the windows. A person with a megaphone announced the sale was canceled. Police ordered the crowd to leave and sealed off the area with yellow tape. Employees posted a sign saying the iPhone 4S was out of stock. \\"We were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd, and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, iPhone will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being,\\" said Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu. Other Apple stores in China opened Friday and Wu said iPhone 4S quickly sold out. She said the phone still will be sold in China through Apple's online store, its local carrier China Unicom Ltd. and retailers that are authorized resellers. Wu declined to comment on what Apple might know about scalpers buying iPhones for resale. China is Apple's fastest-growing market and \\"an area of enormous opportunity,\\" CEO Tim Cook said in October. He said quarterly sales were up nearly four times over a year earlier and accounted for one-sixth of Apple's global sales. Apple's iPhones are hugely popular in China and stores are mobbed for the release of new products. iPhones are manufactured in China by an Apple contractor but new models are released in other countries first. That has helped to fuel a thriving \\"gray market\\" in China for phones smuggled in from Hong Kong and other markets. Last May, the Sanlitun store was closed for several hours after a scuffle between an employee and a customer during the release of the iPhone 4, the previous model in the series. Customers began gathering Thursday afternoon outside the Sanlitun store. People in the crowd said the number grew to as many as 2,000 overnight but many left before dawn after word spread that the store opening would be cancelled. There were about 350 people left when the protest erupted after 7 a.m. \\"On the one hand there is poor organization and on the other there were just too many people,\\" said a man outside the Sanlitun store Friday, who would give only his surname, Miao. \\"I don't think they prepared well enough.\\" Another man who refused to give his name said he was a migrant laborer who was paid 100 yuan (15) to wait in line overnight. Others in the crowd said scalpers had organized groups of 20 to 30 migrant workers to buy phones or hold places in line. Organizers held colored balloons aloft to identify themselves to their workers. Others said they were waiting to buy the phone for themselves. \\"I just like the 4S,\\" said Zhu Xiaodong, a Beijing resident. He said he was upgrading from the previous iPhone 4 model. ___ Associated Press videographer David Wivell and researcher Zhao Liang contributed. ___ Online: Apple Inc.: http:://http://www.apple.com ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Apple's iPhone 4S launch in China was met with chaos on January 13th, 2012, as the main store in Beijing's Sanlitun district failed to open, resulting in would-be customers reacting furiously.

The Others are divided into two camps, with each Other either allied with the forces of Light or the forces of Darkness, and the prologue recounts a great battle between the two sides. Geser, the Lord of the Light, realized that the two forces would eventually annihilate each other. He stopped the battle and offered a truce to the forces of Darkness, led by Zavulon. To make sure each side honored its side of the agreement, the Light would have a \\"Night Watch\\" to monitor the forces of Darkness at night, and the Darkness would have a \\"Day Watch\\" to police the forces of Light during the day.

Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains. Question: Is refraining from touching a hot stoce a common sense or culturally-relative standard?","output":"Refraining from touching a hot stove is a common sense rule.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years. Question: \\"Why does the government have problems with finances?\\" Answer: \\"The board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct. The question asked why the government has problems with finances, but the answer provided only explains why the board quit funding the legal service in July. The answer does not address the broader issue of government financial problems."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: As any homemaker who has tried to keep order at the dinner table knows, there is far more to a family meal than food. Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families to find out just how much more. Lewis and his co-worker carried out their study by videotaping the families while they are having ordinary meals in their own homes. They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children. But as the number of children gets larger,conversation gives way to the parents' efforts to control the loud noise they make. That can have an important effect on the children. \\"In general the more question-asking the parents do, the higher the children's IQ scores,\\"Lewis says. \\" And the more children there are, the less question-asking there is. \\" The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings . Lewis found that in families with three or four children, dinner conversation is likely to center on the oldest child, who has the most to talk about, and the youngest, who needs the most attention. \\" _ \\"says Lewis.

Woods), the younger, stupider brother of Les (Michael Shanks), can't help himself from stealing a rare snake that's been kept in a jar by a Native American snake dealer (Ben Cardinal), and which has to follow some rules: don't let it out of the jar, then don't let it eat anything anything living, and never fear the heart of the snake. Before you can say, \\"That's sort of like Gremlins,\\" the snake is out of the jar, it eats something living (a lot, actually), and... Well, for the never fear the heart of the snake part, it'll take a little while. Oh, yeah: as soon as the snake is out of the jar, it starts growing. And growing. And growing. From this point on, it's a pretty paint-by-number story: the sheriff doesn't believe the story that Les is saying, the mayor doesn't want to stop the local fair the whole city will attend as they didn't have anything better to do, two bizarre hunters who live in the woods want to get the snake \\"their way,\\" a bunch of sheriff's assistants with no name hang around waiting to become snake nibbles, and so on and so forth.

The Kooks are an English pop rock band formed in 2004 in Brighton. The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/rhythm guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty, and the founding drummer was Paul Garred. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008. The Kooks have mentioned drawing on a number of varied sources to create their sound, listing the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Chris de Burgh among influences on songwriting style and musical presentation over the course of their four albums. The band's debut album Inside In/Inside Out was touted as a typical Britpop record, and was influenced by the Libertines, Thin Lizzy, the Police and containing elements of the 60s British pop movement. Pritchard's lyrical style was compared to that of a \\"younger, less pathetic version of Pete Doherty's mush-mouth style\\". The band themselves felt the album was not consistent in its direction. \\"The first record was definitely genre-hopping. [...] The first album was finding its feet, it was gadabout\\", said Harris in an interview for The Sunday Business Post. On the follow-up Konk, the band attempted to find a more mature and polished sound. Drawing on a much wider choice of material for the album (about 80 to 90 new songs had been accumulated within the band's repertoire by this stage), the band began to incorporate more a hard-edged rock focus into their music. Critics drew comparisons to the work of The Kinks throughout the album, it being recorded at the studio owned by Ray Davies. Also noted were the band's growing similarities in musical direction to The Fratellis and the Arctic Monkeys. \\"I think we've made a dynamic album\\", Pritchard said. \\"Every song has its own character. It's a good pop album.\\" The most recent album, Listen, includes much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as \\"percussion sonnets\\". \\"The first couple albums I made I never really thought about rhythms, I focused on the recording and the lyrics\\", Pritchard said.

Sentence 1: \\"Automatic transmission became standard; manual, with or without overdrive, was an option in 1967.\\" This sentence means that in 1967, automatic transmission became the standard, while manual transmission (with or without overdrive) was an optional choice. Sentence 2: \\"Automatic transmission became standard, manually, with or without overdrive, was an option in 1967.\\" In this sentence, the main difference is the addition of the word \\"manually.\\" It's unclear if \\"manually\\" is referring to the process of making the automatic transmission standard or if it's intended as an alternative wording for \\"manual transmission.\\" However, the sentence structure is awkward, making it difficult to interpret its intended meaning with certainty.

By around 3 in the afternoon , she really can not take the pain much further , and we requested the epidural procedure to be performed for my wife . Do not disturb . Question Why are they giving the narrator 's wife so much medicine ? Possible answers: Pick your answer from: -None of the above choices .. -To make her comfortable .. -To make her healthier .. -To make her better .. The answer:","output":"The narrator's wife is being given so much medicine in order to induce labor and manage the pain associated with childbirth. In this context, the induction process involves administering medication to stimulate contractions and accelerate the birth of the baby. This is typically done when the woman is past her due date, if there are concerns about the mother or baby's health, or if labor has not started naturally. As the dosage of the induction medication is increased, it is not uncommon for the woman to experience increasing discomfort and pain. This is because the medication is designed to cause contractions, which are necessary for the baby to be born but can be quite painful. In response to the increasing pain, the couple requested an epidural procedure for pain relief. An epidural is a type of regional anesthesia that is commonly used during labor and childbirth to provide relief from pain and discomfort. It involves administering anesthetic medication through a catheter that is inserted into the epidural space in the lower back. This numbs the nerves responsible for transmitting pain signals from the uterus and birth canal, providing a significant reduction in pain while still allowing the woman to maintain some sensation and movement. The primary goal of these medical interventions, including the induction medications and the epidural, is to ensure a safe and timely delivery for both the mother and baby. While the induction is intended to accelerate labor and facilitate birth, the epidural is designed to help the mother manage pain and remain as comfortable as possible during the process. In summary, the primary reason for giving the narrator's wife so much medicine is to make her comfortable and facilitate a safe and effective childbirth experience."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Many car manufacturers have expanded their product lines to include EV models or have plans to do so in the coming years. Public charging stations have become more accessible, and the cost of EVs has come down. Government incentives also play a vital role in driving the adoption of electric vehicles among consumers. Step 1: Identify a situation to generate a hypothesis. Since the context is about electric vehicles, their popularity, and various factors contributing to their adoption, a suitable situation could be the impact of public charging stations on EV adoption. Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis related to the situation. The hypothesis for this situation could be: \\"An increase in the number and accessibility of public EV charging stations will lead to increased adoption of electric vehicles.\\" Step 3: Justify the hypothesis. The hypothesis is based on the premise that having more public charging stations can reduce range anxiety among potential EV owners, making electric vehicles a more attractive and practical transportation option. Accessibility to charging stations can directly influence consumers' decision-making process, potentially increasing the likelihood of them opting for an EV over a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What name does Goldfarb sign into the race under? Roger Moore Answer:","output":"Title: The Race: Goldfarb's Gambit Genre: Action/Adventure, Comedy Plot: Jack Goldfarb, a talented street racer, struggles to make ends meet as he dreams of making it big on the professional racing circuit. Living in a small town in Nevada, he spends his days working as a mechanic and his nights partaking in underground street races, holding an unbroken winning streak. One day, as Jack is working on his 1968 Ford Mustang, an anonymous letter arrives in the mail. It's an invitation for him to participate in The Royale Race, a prestigious, yet dangerously illegal racing event where the greatest drivers from around the world come to compete, with bets placed by international billionaires. The winner of this race will take home a cash grand prize of 10 million. The location of the race changes each year, and it is only revealed to those who are invited. This year, the race will take place in the breathtaking Swiss Alps within the next month. Seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Jack begins training rigorously to sharpen his driving skills. He visits his estranged older brother, Bobby, to seek guidance from an experienced racer. Bobby agrees to help and together, they prepare Jack and his Mustang for the treacherous terrain of the Alps. As the day of the race approaches, Jack learns of a cunning rival racer and the reigning champion, Victor Maverick. Victor only participates in the race under an alias which is rumored to be a famous name from the racing world. This year, the mysterious racer is rumored to use the name of Roger Moore. Jack, after considering different strategic moves, decides to take up the false identity of Roger Moore and register under it. He believes that by stealing his rival's alias, it will unnerve and intimidate Victor to think an even more skillful racer has taken his place. Jack starts referring to himself and signs into the race under the name of Roger Moore. The day of the race arrives, and the participants are introduced. Under the alias of Roger Moore, Jack lines up at the starting line with the rest of the racers, anxiously waiting for the green flag. Victor Maverick takes notice of \\"Roger Moore\\" and feels the pressure and frustration boiling inside. The race begins, and the competitors speed through the treacherous twists and turns of the Swiss Alps. The anxiety, skill, and intensity only escalate with each passing mile. Jack faces numerous challenges along the way – sabotages by rival racers, extreme weather conditions, and deceptive shortcuts that lead to dangerous drop-offs. However, his determination and brotherly bond with Bobby fuel his unwavering focus. As the finish line approaches, the rivalry between Jack and Victor reaches its culmination. A fierce duel between their vehicles leads to Victor losing control and crashing, leaving Jack ahead of the pack. Jack crosses the finish line first, claiming the title and the grand prize. In the aftermath, Jack reveals his true identity as Jack Goldfarb, earning the respect of the fellow racers, international racing community, and fans. He uses the prize money to build a better life for himself and his brother while pledging to race under his own name from that point onwards, becoming a true icon in the world of racing. The Race: Goldfarb's Gambit becomes a thrilling tale of ambition, strategy, deception, and the power of family bonds, with Jack realizing that his true identity is far more valuable than any alias."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man in yellow pants and wearing no shirt is being watched by many people.\\" can we conclude that \\"A shirtless man is being watched by a crowd.\\"?

Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review has a mixed opinion of the movie. On the positive side, it recognizes the special examination of contrasting personalities, the ironies of success and failure, and the wider appeal of the lessons of genius versus accessibility in the film.

A:","output":"Tengo 105 años."},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. Answer this question please: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation. Step 1: Understand the given background on the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect explains how solar energy easily penetrates greenhouse gases in short wavelengths, while Earth, being cooler, radiates heat in far infrared range (longer wavelengths). Greenhouse gases partially absorb the longer wavelengths, trapping some solar heat and returning it to Earth, which impacts global temperature. Step 2: Analyze the provided information about the two time periods. Time A reflects the sixteenth century with less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Time B reflects the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Step 3: Apply the greenhouse effect concept to the two time periods. In Time A, fewer greenhouse gases were present in the atmosphere, which means less heat would be trapped in the form of terrestrial radiation. In Time B, the higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would lead to more terrestrial radiation being trapped and absorbed. Step 4: Conclude which period sees more trapped terrestrial radiation. Since Time B has more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it would see more trapped terrestrial radiation as compared to Time A."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Can we conclude from \\"A dog with long hair and a red vest runs in the grass.\\" that \\"The cat eats sand.\\"?

Electrical hazards are often a common risk in their line of work, accounting for a considerable number of injuries and fatalities. In this article, we will focus on the personal journey of a scaffolder who had to have his leg and hands amputated after suffering an unfortunate electric shock and how he dealt with the additional surgery to remove his left foot. The Incident The scaffolder, known for his strong work ethic and commitment to his trade, was going about his usual tasks on a construction site. The job required him to handle metal rods that served as structural frameworks for the building. Unbeknownst to him, an exposed high-voltage wire had come into dangerously close proximity to his workspace. When disaster struck, the scaffolder's world changed in an instant. In an unfortunate split second, an electrical current surged through his body as he inadvertently made contact with the exposed wire. His co-workers responded quickly, alerting emergency services and trying to provide first aid until the professionals arrived at the scene. The man was rushed to the hospital, where doctors assessed and treated his extensive injuries. Amputation and Recovery Despite the best efforts of the medical team, it became evident that the severity of his injuries would require the amputation of his leg and both his hands.

A. bottom out B. cross ocean C. collide D. cross river E. carry people The best answer is The answer is:","output":"B. cross ocean and E. carry people A variety of ships navigate the oceans for different purposes, including cruising, research, defense, and transportation. Ships other than cargo ships perform several functions when they are in the ocean, including crossing oceans and carrying people. A) Bottom out: This is not the primary purpose of any ship. \\"Bottom out\\" refers to a ship hitting the ocean floor, but this is an undesirable event and not a goal when vessels are at sea. Hence, this is not the best answer. B) Cross ocean: Ships that are not cargo ships still cross oceans, connecting different continents and countries. These can include passenger ships, ferry boats carrying vehicles and people, and cruise ships that offer luxurious vacations. Military and research vessels may also be crossing oceans for various activities related to exploration or defense. Therefore, this is one of the best answers. C) Collide: Collisions between ships are accidents and not the primary purpose of any sailing vessel. While collisions can happen, it is not ideal, and ships work to avoid such situations. Shipping lanes, maritime regulations, and electronic aids all contribute to the prevention of ship-to-ship collisions. Consequently, this is not the best answer. D) Cross river: Some ships do cross rivers, but this answer is too specific and not applicable to all ships sailing in the ocean. Riverboats and ferries are designed to navigate rivers, but ships like cruise liners, military vessels, and research ships mainly operate in ocean waters. Thus, this answer does not fully address the scope of the question. E) Carry people: Many ships on the ocean transport people, either as passengers or crew members. Passenger ships, ferries, and cruise ships are designed to carry people from one place to another across the ocean. Also, military vessels and research ships have personnel on board in order to complete assigned missions or scientific research. So, this is one of the best answers. In summary, non-cargo ships in the ocean primarily serve to cross oceans (B) and carry people (E) for various purposes such as transportation, vacation, defense, and research. While other answers may touch on specific types of ships or refer to undesirable events (bottoming out and collisions), they do not accurately represent the primary functions of non-cargo ships in the ocean."},{"instruction":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

The super bout between Mayweather and","output":"Manny Pacquiao in 2015 was a prime example of the negotiations and organization required from boxing promoters. In Mayweather's case, he was promoted by his own company, Mayweather Promotions, and Top Rank represented Pacquiao. Here are the steps that Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, would need to take to organize and market a fight in Nevada: 1. Identify the fighters: The first step is to identify the fighters who will be participating in the event. This includes considering their records, popularity, and potential draw for attracting viewers and ticket buyers. Based on these factors, Mayweather would select the fighters that would participate in the boxing event he wants to promote. 2. Secure the venue: With the fighters selected, Mayweather would need to book a venue for the event. In Las Vegas, popular options include the MGM Grand Garden Arena or the T-Mobile Arena. He would need to negotiate rental fees, event dates, and secure necessary permits. 3. Set the fight date: Scheduling the event date is crucial. It needs to be a date that works for the fighters, the venue, and ideally, does not conflict with other major sporting events that could deter viewers. Mayweather would coordinate with all parties to finalize an agreeable date for the fight. 4. Negotiate fighter contracts: As a promoter, Mayweather would need to negotiate and finalize contracts with the fighters. This includes determining fighter purses, the division of pay-per-view revenue, and other terms related to the event and fighter compensation. 5. Coordinate with sanctioning bodies: Mayweather would need to work with the Nevada Athletic Commission and the relevant boxing sanctioning organizations, such as the WBC or WBA, to ensure that the fight is sanctioned and abides by all necessary rules and regulations. 6. Marketing and promotion: With fighters, venue, and date confirmed, Mayweather would need to develop and execute a marketing strategy to promote the event. This could include creating promotional materials such as posters, promotional videos, and press releases, as well as coordinating press conferences or media days for additional exposure. 7. Event logistics: Mayweather, as a promoter, would be responsible for handling all event logistics, such as hiring staff and providing security, ticket sales, and accommodations for fighters and their teams. Promoters also arrange for important services like medical staff, ring announcers, and referees. 8. Insure fighters and testing: Mayweather would need to have all fighters insured against injury, as well as arrange and pay for any necessary drug testing as required by the sanctioning bodies. 9. Post-event: After the event, Mayweather would be responsible for any post-fight tasks, such as settling any financial matters, paying fighters and staff, and filing required reports with the Nevada Athletic Commission. By following these steps, Floyd Mayweather, now with a promoter's license, can effectively organize and market a fight event in Nevada and create memorable moments for fight fans worldwide."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Furthermore, it has ruled that nothing less than an act of Parliament will do. That means that MPs and members of the House of Lords will get to vote on whether it happens. They will also get the chance to try to amend the bill as it passes through the various legislative stages. In principle, this could delay the process. However, in practice it is thought unlikely that Theresa May's end of March deadline will be missed. The government wanted to trigger Article 50 using the Royal Prerogative, which is a set of powers that used to be held by the monarch but now reside with government ministers. That would have meant it could have done so at a time of its choosing and without consulting Parliament at all. The decision that it must specifically pass a bill is significant. Some other procedures would have meant fewer stages in Parliament and no chance to make amendments. A full bill means that both houses of Parliament must agree and amendments are possible. To become an act of Parliament a bill must pass several stages in both the Commons and the Lords. That often takes months of debate, but it doesn't necessarily have to. Emergency legislation can be passed within a single day if everyone agrees it is urgent. The bill to trigger Article 50 won't be that quick, but it needn't take too long. For one thing, it is likely to be a very short bill with only one or two clauses. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that his MPs should not seek to block Article 50. Ken Clarke is expected to be the only Conservative who will vote against it. So the numbers look to be in place to ensure a smooth passage for the bill in the House of Commons. But more MPs may back attempts to amend the bill, for example, by adding conditions about the sort of Brexit the government should negotiate. In principle, the House of Lords could be different. The government does not have a majority and many peers remain strongly opposed to Brexit. However, there is recognition that Parliament voted overwhelmingly to hold a referendum and that the referendum delivered a clear, albeit close, result. Members of the House of Lords, who are not elected, realise that any attempt to frustrate Brexit could be regarded as undemocratic.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. and the situation: Dan studied two islands. Loon island had a very stable environment, and there weren't many diverse species of plants and animals. Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Answer the following question: Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits? The answer is:","output":"Wolf Island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits. To better understand this conclusion, let's take a closer look at the distinct characteristics of each island. Loon Island is characterized by a stable environment, which implies that the conditions remain relatively consistent over time. There are fewer diverse species of plants and animals, suggesting that the existing species might have already adapted to the static environmental conditions. As a result, the pressure for further development or significant changes to their existing traits is limited. In this scenario, natural selection might not play a significant role in shaping the various species, since the environment does not demand significant adaptations. On the other hand, Wolf Island has a vast variety of species, which is a strong indicator that natural selection has been actively shaping the organisms living there. The process of natural selection generally promotes the survival of individuals with advantageous heritable traits as they are better equipped to adapt to their environment. This means that through generations, species on Wolf Island have evolved, retaining beneficial traits while discarding those that are less favorable. Since there is evidence of active natural selection on Wolf Island, it can be inferred that the animals living there have gone through a dynamic process of adapting and changing. These adaptations would result in the development and propagation of more beneficial heritable traits. As a result, the animals on Wolf Island are more likely to exhibit a higher number of beneficial heritable traits when compared to those on Loon Island. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Wolf Island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits due to its diverse species and the active role of natural selection in shaping its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon.

He is especially despised by PFC. Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway (John Agar), the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC.

His rigorous training methods make him unpopular among the squad, especially with PFC. Peter Conway and PFC. Al Thomas. The movie showcases the battle in Tarawa, where the men slowly realize the importance of Stryker's training methods throughout various challenging situations. However, the question asks for the number of Japanese that must be battled in Iwo Jima. The movie portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima as one of the most significant battles in which the Marines participate. This battle was an actual historical event that took place between February 19, 1945, and March 26, 1945, involving the United States and Japan. The Japanese forces present on the island of Iwo Jima consisted of approximately 21,000 men. These forces were primarily located in hidden bunkers and tunnels throughout the island, making it a well-fortified defense point. The American forces invading the island consisted of around 70,000 Marines. In the movie, the events leading up to the Battle of Iwo Jima are focused on the Marines and their training, rather than providing an exact count of the Japanese forces they would come up against in battle. During the battle itself, the squad led by Sergeant Stryker would likely face numerous Japanese soldiers, but the movie does not provide specific numbers. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to the question regarding how many Japanese must be battled in Iwo Jima based solely on the context of the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima.\\" In real-life events, the U.S. Marines faced around 21,000 Japanese soldiers, but it is important to note that this figure applies to the overall battle and not specifically to the squad depicted in the movie."},{"instruction":"This article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music?, what is it ?

The review highlights two key things: it is affectionately goofy and a satire. Let's deconstruct these elements for a better understanding: 1. Affectionately goofy - The use of the word \\"affectionately\\" suggests that the movie has a certain warmth and that the goofiness is endearing and charming to the viewer. Goofy refers to the silly, lighthearted humor present in the movie. By stating that the movie is affectionately goofy, the critic implies that they enjoyed the humor and appreciated the warmhearted approach to it. 2.

Options: - happiness for - new laws - protest - change in leadership - cultural revolution The answer is \\"cultural revolution\\" because Answer:","output":"When a coup-de-etat occurs with the intention of transforming society, the most suitable option among the given choices is \\"change in leadership.\\" Let's evaluate each step taken to arrive at this conclusion. 1. Analyzing the question: The question presents an event (coup-de-etat) that happens with the aim of modifying society. We need to determine the appropriate response or outcome from the given options. 2. Examining each option: - Happiness for: Happiness as a result of a coup is potentially vague and not directly connected to the transformation of society. - New laws: While new laws can be part of the societal change process, they are not the primary driving force by themselves. - Protest: Protests can lead to change, but they are not an outcome or result in the context of a coup-de-etat seeking societal change. - Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat often involves the removal of existing leaders and the establishment of new ones. This factor could significantly impact societal change and aligns with the given context. - Cultural revolution: Although a cultural revolution can lead to changes in society, it is typically broader in nature and not a direct consequence of a coup-de-etat specifically aimed to change society. 3. Justifying the choice: Upon examining and comparing the options, \\"change in leadership\\" is most closely related to a coup-de-etat aimed at transforming society. New leadership can initiate the necessary changes through policymaking and decision-making, enabling the desired societal changes to take place."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Si es necesario, reinicie la diapositiva mediante clic en el botón de Deshacer.","output":"If necessary, restart the slide by clicking on the Undo button."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Susan Selky is a well-known English professor at Columbia University. She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop... Answer:","output":"Considering the various elements of the movie plot, a possible question to generate about this story could be: How do the characters in the film deal with grief, guilt, and the uncertainty surrounding the disappearance of Alex, and how do these emotions impact their relationships and actions throughout the film? This question encourages an exploration of the emotional aspects of the story, focusing on the characters' reactions and personal growth in response to the challenging circumstances. Specifically, the question addresses the complexities of the relationships between Susan, Graham, Menetti, and other characters while they cope with the uncertainty of Alex's disappearance. Analyzing Susan's character, we can observe how she faces public scrutiny and criticism for allowing her son to walk to school alone. Despite this pressure, she remains determined to find her son and navigates the emotionally challenging situation by cooperating with the authorities and facing media attention. Her resilience and hope throughout the investigation reveal her character's strength and highlight how she bears the emotional burden of being a mother searching for her missing child. Graham, Susan's estranged husband, copes with the guilt of not being present for his son's life and tries to take matters into his own hands by investigating the ransom call. His vigilante-like actions and subsequent hospitalization further strain his relationship with Susan and the authorities, specifically Lieutenant Menetti. However, these events also demonstrate his need to find a sense of control in the face of uncertainty and the emotional weight of the situation. Lieutenant Menetti, the central figure of the investigation, experiences mounting pressure in the form of time constraints, budget cuts, and competing caseloads while attempting to solve the Selky case. Menetti's prioritization of Alex's disappearance displays his commitment to helping Susan find closure, even as his resources are limited and priorities shift to new cases. His character embodies the persistence and determination of police officers in solving such mysteries. In conclusion, exploring the emotions and dynamics of the main characters in the film, in the context of Alex's disappearance, allows for a deep understanding of how grief, guilt, and uncertainty impact the characters' lives and decisions. Moreover, it emphasizes the human element in such tragic circumstances and highlights how people cope with adversity and seek closure and answers."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Ernest William Gimson, a renowned British architect and furniture designer, was born on the 21st of December, 1864, in Leicester, England. He played a significant role in the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain and left a lasting impact on the world of design and architecture. Gimson grew up in a prosperous family; his father was an engineer and his mother was the sister of the renowned biologist, Thomas Henry Huxley. His family's background provided the necessary grounding in both the arts and sciences. He attended the local school in Leicester and went on to study engineering at the Royal Indian Engineering College in London. In 1884, Gimson was drawn to the Arts and Crafts movement led by William Morris, who emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and the integrity of materials in design. This new inspiration led to Gimson's pursuit of a career in architecture. He started as an apprentice under the guidance of John Dando Sedding, a leading figure in the movement, before establishing his own practice in 1890 in partnership with fellow architect and designer Sidney Barnsley. Throughout his career, Gimson enjoyed success in both architectural and furniture design, leaving a significant mark on British craftsmanship. He respected tradition but simultaneously pushed the boundaries of design by experimenting with new techniques and materials. Among his most notable architectural projects were the additions to Pinbury Park in Gloucestershire and the Stoneywell Cottage in Leicestershire. In 1902, Gimson opened a furniture workshop with master craftsman Ernest Smith to create handmade items that are known for their unique details and classic simplicity. Pieces crafted during this time include cabinetry, chairs, and other home furnishings, embodying the \\"truth-to-materials\\" principle he admired. He also took up embroidery, developing an interest in traditional English needlework techniques and incorporating them into his textiles. Gimson's life took an unfortunate turn in 1914 due to the onset of World War I. Although his furniture workshop was repurposed for wartime production, his health started to decline, causing the workshop to close its doors. Ernest William Gimson passed away on the 12th of August, 1919, at his home in Sapperton, England. Today, he is remembered as a prominent figure in the British Arts and Crafts movement, whose dedication to craftsmanship and deep understanding of nature, materials, and aesthetics left a lasting influence on the design world. Gimson's work has been preserved and showcased in various museums and exhibitions, further cementing his significant contribution to the cultural fabric of Britain."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Owls' hunting behavior is primarily influenced by biological and environmental factors, such as their highly developed senses of hearing and vision, and the availability of prey in their habitat. The grinding of coal is an unrelated industrial process that does not have any direct connection to owls or their hunting behavior. While it is possible that coal mining and related activities could have indirect effects on some owls through habitat destruction or pollution, the specific scenario of coal not being grindable does not influence owls' ability to hunt at night.

This is in direct contrast to the hermit's intended lifestyle and living arrangement. 3. The given question highlights that the hermit's living space is located \\"on the hill.\\" This geographical context reinforces the idea of the hermit seeking seclusion in a natural environment. A hill is an unlikely place for an apartment, hotel, condo, or loft, making \\"dwelling\\" the most suitable option in this situation.

The game was broadcast on NBC Sunday Night Football, the ninth consecutive year that a Bears-Packers was held in prime time. Entering the game, Jay Cutler had struggled against the Packers, with a 67.0 passer rating, the lowest against any team. He also had thrown 13 touchdowns against 19 interceptions, and heading into the game, led the league in turnovers with 12, which led to 44 total points by opponents. However, the Bears' rushing attack took on the Packers' worst-ranked run defense, which had allowed 153.5 yards per game on 32.1 rushing attempts. The offense had to avoid long-distance drives, as they were ranked 29th in the NFL in points scored outside the red zone with 31. On defense, the Bears' rushing defense faced a Green Bay rushing game that was one of ten teams in the NFL to average less than 100 yards per game with 97.5 yards on 24.3 attempt, which ranked 26th, ahead of the Bears by one spot. However, the Packers also averaged 4.02 yards per carry and 4.3 yards per carry on first down. The Bears' pass defense also had to face Aaron Rodgers, who ranked third in the league with 8.22 yards per pass. In addition, the team had to be wary in the event they attempted to blitz; Rodgers had the highest passer rating against the blitz with 130.71, along with eight touchdowns and one interception. Over their previous five games, the Packers had scored an average of 33.6 points, while the Bears had allowed 32 average points in their last five games. The Packers were seven-point favorites, and the game's over/under of 53.5 points is the highest total of week ten games. Terrance Mitchell, Khaseem Greene, Darryl Sharpton, Eben Britton, Blake Annen, David Bass, and DeDe Lattimore were the inactives for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and received, but punted after their first drive. From their own 29-yard line, the Packers drove to the Bears' one, where Rodgers threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Bostick. On the second play of the Bears' next drive, Cutler was intercepted by Micah Hyde, and the Packers converted the turnover into a Rodgers' four-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Quarless. After the Bears were forced to punt again, the Packers' drive (which lasted into the second quarter) ended with Rodgers throwing a 73-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson, and scored again after the Bears punted for the fourth consecutive time, this time on Rodgers' 40-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On Chicago's next possession, the offense reached the Packers' four-yard line, but on 4th down, Cutler's pass to Alshon Jeffery was incomplete, and from their own five-yard line, the Packers eventually scored on Rodgers' 56-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Lacy. Chicago's next drive again led to zero points, with Cutler being sacked on 4th down by Morgan Burnett. The Packers reclaimed the ball on their 43-yard line, but two plays later, reached the Bears' seven-yard line after Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference of 53 yards. However, Randall Cobb fumbled after being stripped by Lance Briggs, Ryan Mundy recovering in the endzone. However, the Bears would give the ball back with Cutler being strip-sacked by Julius Peppers at the Bears' 37-yard line. The Packers would extend their lead to 42-0 with Rodgers throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. The Bears ended the first half with a kneel. In the third quarter, the Packers punted for the first time in the game, the ball being returned for no gain at the Bears' 30-yard line, but would be pushed back to the 15-yard line due to Teddy Williams' personal foul penalty. After the Bears went three-and-out, Pat O'Donnell's punt was kicked by Jarrett Boykin and recovered by O'Donnell; the block was officially recorded as a fumble, and as a result, the Bears were considered to have turned the ball on downs. The Packers would score on Mason Crosby's 20-yard field goal. Despite a chance to tie the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a game, Rodgers was pulled for the Packers' third drive of the quarter for Matt Flynn. The Bears scored their first points of the game off Cutler's 45-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. Crosby would kick another field goal, this time a 52-yarder, to make the score 48-7. After both teams exchanged punts, the Bears' drive, which went into the final quarter, reached the Packers' 18-yard line, but Cutler's pass for Matt Forte hit Kyle Long's head, and bounced into Casey Hayward's hands, who scored on the 82-yard return. On the ensuing kickoff, with blocking along the Bears' sideline, Chris Williams scored on the 101-yard return to make the score 55-14. After the Packers punted again, Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler for the Bears' final drive, but was sacked by Sam Barrington on 4th down; the Packers would run out the clock to end the game. The 42 points allowed in the first half was a franchise record, and the six touchdown passes allowed in the half was an NFL record.

The ghouls relentlessly search for human flesh to consume and thrive upon. A group of unlikely heroes unites to uncover the origin and purpose of these unearthly beings to save the town from complete eradication. Act I: Whispering Creek, a peaceful town surrounded by thick forests, is home to families who have lived there for generations. Rowena, a young independent investigative journalist, moves to town after inheriting her late grandmother's house. Intrigued by the town's dark history, Rowena begins digging through dusty archives at the local library. She meets Oliver, a librarian with a keen interest in the town's folklore. One night, a series of disturbances are reported at the local cemetery. The town sheriff, Alex, hesitant to involve the eccentric outsiders, grudgingly asks for Rowena and Oliver's help. They soon discover that ghouls have risen from their slumber within the Earth's depths and have started feasting on human flesh. The first victim is discovered at the cemetery, horribly mutilated and drained of all life. Act II: As the gravity of the situation sets in, the town comes together under the leadership of Sheriff Alex to devise a plan to combat the ghouls. Local legends narrate the sealing of the ghouls long ago by a band of powerful mystics where they were trapped in the underground caverns, away from human contact. However, recent mining activities have unleashed the ghouls, awakening them from their dormant state. As the feast on human flesh continues, the ghouls grow more powerful and exhibit horrifying abilities to manipulate shadows and darkness. Rowena, Oliver, and Alex come across an ancient grimoire in her grandmother's belongings that contains crucial information regarding the ghoul's weaknesses and methods to reseal them. Meanwhile, tensions rise as townspeople start disappearing one by one, including the Mayor of Whispering Creek. Act III: Armed with the information from the grimoire, Rowena, Oliver, Alex, and a small group of remaining townspeople face the ghoulish horde during the night of the new moon, when the ghouls are at their weakest. The battle is brutal and unforgiving. The heroes use traditional methods such as holy water, sacred talismans, and incantations to weaken the ghouls. Melinda, a local medic, saves the day when she discovers that a rare herb found in the surrounding forests, 'lunarsbane,' weakens the ghouls when ingested and renders them vulnerable. With the help of a community effort, the majority of the ghouls are tracked down and eliminated. The spirits of the fallen town members are honored in a ceremony led by Oliver. However, a few of the strongest ghouls manage to escape into the night. Act IV: In a final stand, Rowena, Oliver, and Alex track down the remaining ghouls to their underground lair, where they discover the Mayor has become the 'Ghoul Master' - a human who has embraced the dark powers controlling the ghouls to take revenge on the town he felt had betrayed him. Through a combination of knowledge, bravery, and teamwork, the heroes defeat the ghouls and the Ghoul Master. Using the grimoire, they enact the sealing ritual, sacrificing a part of their own life force to ensure that the ghouls remain trapped for good. As the battle is won, the three heroes vow to keep the people of Whispering Creek safe from such evil in the future. The town begins to rebuild, grateful for the return of peace and relative normalcy. Rowena decides to call Whispering Creek her permanent home, and together with Oliver and Alex, they form an alliance to safeguard their community from any supernatural threats lurking in the shadows."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: We are dedicated to providing Sterling Colorado Dog Bite Injury lawyers and law firms with quality white-hat online marketing services that will improve their brand, increase their web visibility, and generate more online business..","output":"Nos dedicamos a proporcionar a los abogados y bufetes de abogados especializados en lesiones por mordedura de perro en Sterling, Colorado, servicios de marketing en línea de calidad y con buenas prácticas que mejorarán su marca, aumentarán su visibilidad en la web y generarán más negocios en línea.

Unfortunately, the experience I had at Sunshine Café left me feeling underwhelmed and frustrated. Upon arrival at the café, the exterior looked promising with its cheerful décor and inviting atmosphere. A sign over the entrance boasted of locally-grown and fresh ingredients in their menu items, and individuals leaving the café appeared to be in high spirits. It was with great excitement that I decided to give the place a try. Little did I know what awaited me inside. As I walked into the café, the first thing I noticed was the overpowering smell of stale cooking oil. While I understand that various dishes prepared in a café can require the use of oil, the space should have had proper ventilation to prevent such an unpleasant odor. Already feeling a sense of unease, I nevertheless proceeded to take a seat and peruse the menu. The menu was extensive, with a wide selection of dishes, desserts, and drinks, which was impressive at first glance. However, closer inspection revealed that many of the items were unappetizingly titled, with uncreative and unappealing descriptions. In fact, the wording was so vague that it was difficult to discern what ingredients were used or how the dish was prepared. As a result, I had a tough time making a decision on what to order. Before I could flag down a server to inquire more about the confusing menu items, I was left waiting for a significant amount of time. It seemed as though the wait staff were more preoccupied with socializing among themselves than attending to the customers around them. When a server finally took my order, the interaction felt rushed, indifferent, and lacking any semblance of genuine hospitality. I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple pasta dish with a side salad and a cappuccino. When my food eventually arrived, a full 40 minutes after I placed my order, the presentation was lackluster. The portion size of my pasta was meager at best, and the side salad – wilted. Additionally, my drink was served lukewarm, with an unimpressive foam pattern that seemed hastily poured. As I took a bite of my pasta, I was sorely disappointed with the mediocre taste and unevenly cooked noodles. The sauce lacked depth and showed no signs of the purported \\"bold flavors\\" mentioned on the menu. The side salad was equally unappetizing with a generic dressing that resembled more a plain oil than a vinaigrette. The cappuccino was passable, but certainly not worth the inflated price. To add insult to injury, the cleanliness of the establishment left much to be desired. The floors appeared unkempt, with food debris and litter scattered around. The restroom facilities were also far from hygienic, with a noticeable lack of basic supplies such as toilet paper and hand soap. In conclusion, my visit to Sunshine Café was an unfortunate disappointment. I cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment to others based on the subpar food quality, slow service, unclean environment, and overall lack of attentiveness. Though my friends and colleagues may have had positive experiences here, it would seem that something serious has changed at Sunshine Café for the worse, and I do hope they can turn it around for future patrons."},{"instruction":"Käsittelemme komissiolle osoitettuja kysymyksiä.

Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election. This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican. \\"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening. Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using 84,000 in taxpayer funds. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the 84,000 involved in the settlement. The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold. The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination. Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \\"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\\" All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career. Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary. Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C. Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign. Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment. Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out. But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior. In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation. Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble. Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest. A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\\" And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson. “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.” “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.” Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Photo: Handout Photo Photo: Handout Photo Image 1 of / 59 Caption Close U.S. Rep. Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \\"sexualized commentary\\" in his Capitol Hill office. The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint. ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office. Now Playing: Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress. Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for 84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay. Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \\"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\\" she said on CNN Thursday. Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit. Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican. Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \\"poor performance.\\" Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint. Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold. SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation. Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing. The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now. \\"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case. After details of their 84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute. But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March. Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact. In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \\"sexual fantasies\\" and \\"wet dreams\\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her. Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \\"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\\" Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \\"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\\" Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \\"anger issues.\\" She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized. Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter. According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \\"differently.\\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \\"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\\" The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \\"nothing to add.\\" In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \\"independent investigative team\\" to address the two women's concerns. \\"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement. \\"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\\" Daniels said. Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \\"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\\" Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \\"full compliance with office policy and the law.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’” Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said. As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an 84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation. A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work. ||||| Summary:","output":"US Rep.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less trees blocking the sun happens, how will it affect the plant takes in more carbon dioxide. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Photosynthesis is the process through which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process can be affected by various factors, including light availability, the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), and water. The process of photosynthesis can be summarized as follows: 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant. 2. The light energy is trapped and used to excite electrons in the chlorophyll molecules. 3. The plant absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the environment through tiny pores known as stomata. 4. The plant also takes up water (H2O) through its roots. 5. Using the light energy, the plant converts the water and carbon dioxide into glucose (C6H12O6) and releases oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned considers a scenario where there are fewer trees blocking the sun, essentially increasing light availability for the plant. Consequently, the plant would receive more sunlight, which could potentially increase the rate of photosynthesis. However, the increased photosynthesis rate would also depend on the availability of carbon dioxide and water, which are the other critical components of this process. If a plant receives a higher light intensity resulting from fewer trees blocking the sun, it may not necessarily take in more carbon dioxide unless the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere around the plant rises as well. The stomata, which regulate the uptake of CO2, respond to various environmental factors like humidity, CO2 concentrations, and temperature, among others. While an abundance of sunlight may improve the energy availability for photosynthesis, the plant may not absorb more CO2 if the other factors remain constant. However, if the increased sunlight were accompanied by elevated CO2 levels, the plant would likely take in more CO2, leading to a higher photosynthesis rate. Nevertheless, this increase would still be limited by other factors, such as water availability, temperature, and nutrients, ensuring that the overall effect on the photosynthetic process is complex and influenced by multiple environmental variables. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you suggested could potentially impact the process of photosynthesis only if it influences other crucial factors, such as CO2 concentration and water availability. Increased sunlight alone may not have a significant direct effect, but it can contribute to indirect consequences on plant growth, development, and overall performance."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One day a lady saw a mouse running across her kitchen floor.

The study found 16 to 24-year-olds are among the least literate and numerate in the world, lagging behind those in countries including Estonia, Poland and the Slovak Republic. England came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Damning report: An international study has found that the UK's young people are 'among the least literate and numerate in the developed world' (file picture) The figures showed many Japanese school leavers are more advanced than English university graduates. The OECD said England was the only country where the oldest age group studied (55-65) had a higher proficiency in literacy and numeracy than the youngest (16-24) after other factors such as sex, socio-economic background and type of occupation were taken into account. The organisation warned England would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken. The Tories said the report exposed the failings of Labour during its 13 years in power. ‘These are Labour’s children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations,’ said skills and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock. Labour came to power in 1997 after Tony Blair pledged his priority would be ‘education, education, education’. England was the only country in developed world in which those aged 55-65 performed better than 16-24-year-olds. Today's. findings show that the billions poured into education by Labour failed. to push up standards of literacy and numeracy, critics have said. The. Government has claimed that the OECD's research underlines who. 'Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a. diet of dumbing down and low expectations.' Official. figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown that. Labour’s spending on education rose from £35.3billion in 2000 to. £63.9billion in 2009. Yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations. Last year a different report found despite Tony Blair declaring his priorities as ‘education, education,. education’ when he swept to power in 1997, a huge increase in spending. on schools led to ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’. The OECD study – Education at a Glance – found that expenditure on. UK primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of GDP. increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009, higher than. the OECD average of four per cent. At the same time, there has been ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report said. Spending in the sector soared by 78. per cent from £50billion to £89billion by the time the party lost the. election in 2010. During this period, GCSE and A-level grades rose every. year, which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down. Andreas. Schleicher, of the OECD, said young adults had more qualifications than. those nearing retirement, but not greater abilities. This indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills. The finding ‘doesn’t look good for the UK’, Mr Schleicher said. The 466-page study was the first carried out by the OECD into the work skills of 16 to 65-year-olds, establishing their abilities in literacy, numeracy and problem solving. A total of 166,000 were interviewed in 24 countries, including 9,000 in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales were not covered. The study found a quarter of adults in England (8.5million) have the maths skills of a ten-year-old, with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers. Literacy levels are also below average, with 16.4 per cent of adults (5.8million) reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school. Just 42.4 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving. This was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 50.7 per cent, and 21 behind the best-performing country, South Korea. Not moving forward: This chart from the report shows how Britain's young people and older people are roughly at the same level, whereas countries like Korea are showing huge improvement between generations. Picture of Britain: This graph shows how the UK compared to other industrial nations when it came to numeracy. Interesting: Countries like Japan, Netherlands and Sweden were the top performing in terms of literacy, even though children start school often years later than British youngsters. England produced 8 per cent of the world’s most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s. This has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue. The report said the ‘talent pool of highly skilled adults in England... is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries’ in the next few decades. The slide could be reversed only if ‘significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people’. England also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood. One positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent, resulting in high productivity and wages. The Coalition has taken steps to improve education, demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher. The number of top GCSE and A-level grades has now decreased for the past two years. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The OECD report highlights what our members tell us – that young people don’t have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly. We need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age.’ The shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, defended Labour’s record, saying it ‘drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010’. Failed? The Government said today this generation of young people are 'Labour's children' 'force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations' Mike Harris, of the Institute of Directors, said the report ‘underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers’ real-world experience of interviewing and employing people’. Former Labour education and employment secretary David Blunkett questioned the OECD’s methodology and said the report ‘warranted united action, not party political point scoring’. Education has undergone massive change since Labour began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965. In 1988 GCSEs replaced O-levels and the National Curriculum was introduced, and in 1997 Labour abolished the Assisted Places Scheme awarding free places at fee-paying schools to gifted children from low or middle-income families. The academy schools programme began in 2000, with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control. In 2010 the Coalition launched free schools, which are similar to academies but can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, charities. Participants in the skills survey were asked to answer a series of questions testing their numeracy, literacy and problem solving. Here are some examples:. NUMERACY. LITERACY. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a report that says young people in England are not doing as well as their grandparents in reading and math. This is a big problem because it's important for young people to have good skills in order to get good jobs and help their country succeed. England is ranked 22nd out of 24 countries for reading skills and 21st for math skills. The report suggests that the education system needs to improve so that young people can do better in the future."},{"instruction":"Is it mandatory to stay for 11 months in a rented house if the rental agreement was made for 11 months? What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different aspects of a rental situation. The first question is about the obligations of a tenant who has signed an 11-month rental agreement, while the second question pertains to the potential disadvantages faced by the house owner if a rental agreement is made for a period longer than 11 months. Question 1: Is it mandatory to stay for 11 months in a rented house if the rental agreement was made for 11 months? Answer: It is not mandatory for a tenant to stay in a rented house for the entire duration of an 11-month rental agreement. However, the agreement serves as a legally binding contract between the landlord and the tenant that stipulates the terms of the tenancy, including the duration of the lease and the conditions for lease termination. While it is not mandatory to stay for the entire lease term, it is expected that both parties honor the agreement and its terms. In the event that a tenant wishes or needs to vacate the premises before the 11 months are up, proper communication with the landlord is essential. Tenants should review the lease terms and identify specific conditions that deal with early termination of the lease. Typically, there may be an early termination clause that may require the tenant to provide notice in advance or pay a termination fee, which could be equivalent to one or two months' rent. However, the specifics of notice period and termination fee may vary depending on the rental agreement. Question 2: What are the disadvantages faced by the house owner when a rent agreement for a period of more than 11 months is made? Answer: A rental agreement for a period of more than 11 months may impose certain disadvantages on the house owner, though these disadvantages may vary depending on the regulations and laws of the specific jurisdiction. Some potential disadvantages may include the following: 1. Legal and tax implications: In certain jurisdictions, rental agreements longer than 11 months are considered long-term leases and may have different legal, tax, and stamp duty obligations than short-term leases. This may involve extra paperwork and result in higher taxation. 2. Lower flexibility: A longer lease term can limit the landlord's flexibility in adjusting rent according to changing market conditions or their own financial needs. If the rental market is experiencing growth, it may be more difficult for the landlord to increase rents if they are locked into a long-term lease agreement. 3. Difficulty in evicting problematic tenants: If a lease term is longer than 11 months, the house owner may face more difficulties in evicting a problematic tenant. Long-term lease agreements may offer stronger legal protections for tenants, making it harder for landlords to resolve issues without resorting to time-consuming and costly court proceedings. 4. Reduced ability to sell or renovate: A long-term rental agreement may limit the house owner's ability to renovate, sell, or move back into the property if circumstances change. Longer leases can complicate the selling process, especially if potential buyers want vacant possession of the property. It is important to note that these disadvantages are not universal, as laws and regulations vary between jurisdictions. House owners should consult with local legal and real estate professionals to understand the implications of a specific rental agreement term in their area."},{"instruction":"Agriculture minister argues case for opening US border to live &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; NEW YORK (CP) - Agriculture Minister Andy Mitchell came away empty-handed Saturday after arguing the case for reopening the Canada-US border to live cattle exports in a meeting with his American counterpart.

In the 1930s, Walton's relationship with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked them as much as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.Walton's first major composition after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300.After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered the work in the US under...

Sentence A: The dog chased the cat. Sentence B: The cat was chased by the dog. Stream-of-consciousness explanation: To determine which sentence demonstrates a passive voice sentence structure, we first need to understand the difference between active and passive voice. In an active voice sentence, the subject of the sentence performs the action, while in a passive voice sentence, the subject is acted upon. Looking at Sentence A, \\"The dog chased the cat,\\" the subject, \\"the dog,\\" is performing the action, \\"chased,\\" on the object, \\"the cat.\\" Because the subject is taking direct action, this sentence is in the active voice. Now let's analyze Sentence B, \\"The cat was chased by the dog.\\" Here, the subject, \\"the cat,\\" is not performing the action. Instead, the action, \\"was chased,\\" is being done to the subject by the agent, \\"the dog.\\" This construction shows that the subject is being acted upon, indicating the use of a passive voice sentence structure. Therefore, Sentence B is the passive voice sentence in this example."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want.","output":"Once upon a time, in a beautiful garden, there lived two best friends named Butterfly and Bee.

Breaking the habit is a matter of correcting the behavior when you notice you’re doing it. Breath through your nose instead of your mouth whenever you notice that you’re doing it. If you’re having issues breathing through your nose because it’s a habit, you can leave written reminders for yourself. Write “breathing” on sticky notes and place them on your computer or inside of books to remind yourself to use your nose to breathe. If your nose is stuffed from allergies or a cold, over-the-counter nasal sprays may be able to clear your nostrils and help your breath through your nose. Purchase the spray from a drugstore and read the directions before using it. Clear your nose first by blowing it, then carefully place the end of the nozzle into your nostril and press down on the applicator to spray the solution into your nose. Sheets and carpets can harbor pet dander and dust and can make allergies worse. Cleaning them once a week will prevent dust buildup and can make it easier to breathe through your nose. If you sleep with your pet, you should try to sleep without them to see if that clears up your nose. Upholstered furniture is more likely to trap dirt and dust. Use leather, wooden, or vinyl furniture instead. Breathe through your nose for 2-3 minutes straight, then close your mouth, inhale deeply, and pinch your nose with your fingers. When you can't hold your breath any longer, slowly start to exhale through your nose. Continue to do this several times until you clear your nose. Many exercises like running, biking, and yoga require good breathing technique. If you get trained by a professional, they will give you the techniques you need to breathe properly through your nose. Look for classes locally and talk to your trainer about your mouth breathing problem.","output":"Mouth breathing may be due to structural causes, mouth issues, or simply a habit. To break this habit, one must consciously correct their behavior and ensure they breathe through their nose. A helpful tip involves leaving written reminders to maintain awareness of proper breathing. Sticky notes placed on frequently-used items like computers or books may serve as reminders to breathe through the nose. For individuals struggling with nasal blockage due to allergies or cold, over-the-counter nasal sprays can alleviate symptoms. These sprays may be purchased at drugstores, and users should follow the directions carefully for a proper application. Blowing the nose before applying the spray aids in clearing the nostrils. Regular cleaning of sheets and carpets, especially for individuals prone to allergies, is important in minimizing dust and pet dander accumulation. It is recommended to clean these items once a week and consider sleeping without pets to improve nasal breathing. Additionally, using furniture made of leather, wood, or vinyl – materials less likely to harbor dust – can also contribute to a healthier environment. To clear a stuffed nose, practice breathing through the nose for 2-3 minutes, close the mouth, inhale deeply, and pinch the nose. Upon reaching the limit of breath-holding, exhale slowly through the nose, repeating the process until the nose clears. Incorporating healthy nasal breathing into exercise routines like running, biking, and yoga is also beneficial. Professional trainers can provide guidance on integrating the correct breathing techniques during these activities. Consulting with local classes and trainers, while informing them of the mouth-breathing issue, will provide tailored support and help in developing proper nasal breathing techniques."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Abrothrix longipilis, also known as the long-haired grass mouse or long-haired akodont, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae.

Sentence: These are both species of mouse.","output":"While the statement \\"These are both species of mouse\\" might be considered somewhat correct in colloquial terms, it is important to provide a more precise and detailed explanation within a biological context. The text describes Abrothrix longipilis, the long-haired grass mouse or long-haired akodont, which is a species of rodent belonging to the family Cricetidae. It is found in central and southern Argentina and Chile. Abrothrix sanborni, mentioned in the text as the \\"southern Chilean,\\" is another species of rodent within the same family. The text suggests that Abrothrix sanborni may not be distinct from Abrothrix longipilis, which implies that they could potentially be the same species.

For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too. Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag. So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her.

However, it is later revealed that Anna is deaf, and her lack of interaction with others is likely due to this communication barrier rather than any arrogance or aloofness.

After her parents divorced, she lived with her mother. When her father died in 1977, 9-year-old Lisa Marie became joint heir to his estate with her grandfather Vernon Presley and her great-grandmother Minnie Mae Presley. Following the deaths of Vernon in 1979 and Minnie Mae in 1980, she became the sole heir and inherited Graceland. Lisa Marie Presley was indoctrinated into the Church of Scientology in 1977 by her mother, Priscilla. Priscilla had discovered books pertaining to Scientology among the belongings of her ex-husband, Elvis Presley, after his death on August 16, 1977. In October 1997, Presley, along with friend and fellow Memphian and Scientologist Isaac Hayes, opened the Literacy, Education and Ability Program (LEAP). LEAP is run by Applied Scholastics, a group run by Scientologists. On January 5, 2002, Presley received the Humanitarian Award from the World Literacy Crusade for her efforts to help children across America learn valuable skills for study and improve their lives. Lisa Marie Presley received her award from Isaac Hayes, Chaka Khan and Yolanda King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr. World Literacy Crusade is regarded by critics as a front group for the Church of Scientology. On September 26 of that same year Lisa Marie Presley addressed a Congressional hearing in opposition to the use of medication in treating ADHD, stating: \\"I have spoken to children who have been forced to take a cocaine-like stimulant to control their behavior; I have shared their sense of sheer desperation. Children have been wrenched from their family's care simply because their parents favored an alternative, drug-free approach to addressing educational and behavioral problems. The psychotropic drugging of millions of children has to stop.\\" These views reflected her beliefs as a Scientologist. Addressing the Committee as the International Spokesperson for Children's Rights, for the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a group run by Scientologists, Presley expressed her view that parents should be informed about alternatives to drugs so they may \\"make an informed choice about their child's educational and medical needs\\".

Of course, after all the engagement and wedding stuff, Takahashi got a bonus prize: The Guinness World Record for “largest GPS drawing” ever. As exciting as that must have been, it probably wore off quickly when Takahashi realized he would have to spend every day convincing his now-wife that his trip wasn’t at all about getting his name in the history books. Good luck with that, buddy! |||||Summary:","output":"Yasushi Takahashi, a Japanese artist, created the largest GPS drawing in the world, which spans 7,163.67 km (4,451 miles) long, in order to propose to his girlfriend. The drawing spelled out 'Marry Me' across the length of Japan, with a heart covering the island of Hokkaido. The massive proposal was completed on June 9, 2010, and happily, his girlfriend said 'yes'. Takahashi's incredible feat began in 2008 when he quit his job and set out on a six-month journey across Japan using cars, ferries, and his feet. He carried a GPS tracker with him to record his movements, which would eventually form the characters \\"Marry Me\\" and a heart pierced by an arrow. The artist's painstaking efforts not only resulted in a successful marriage proposal but also a Guinness World Record for the largest GPS drawing in history. While it is unclear where his girlfriend was during the entire process, the end result was a truly unforgettable and unique experience for both of them. Takahashi's extraordinary proposal set the bar high for romantic gestures and proved that love knows no bounds or distances. His commitment showcased a level of dedication and creativity rarely seen in modern-day proposals. Although achieving the Guinness World Record must have been thrilling, the real focus was on his love for his partner and his willingness to go the extra mile (or thousands of miles) for her."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Galician.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you. Question: The narrator was thankful: Options: A. during the time she treated her body badly B. not enough information C. after she treated her body badly D. before she treated her body badly === The correct answer is A:","output":"C. after she treated her body badly"},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- An 11-mile stretch of the Mississippi River near Greenville, Mississippi, was closed Monday to most vessel traffic because of low water levels, idling nearly a hundred boats and barges in the stream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. \\"We are allowing a limited number of vessels based on size\\" to attempt to pass, said New Orleans-based Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Tippets, adding that the closure was affecting 97 vessels Monday afternoon and was halting both northbound and southbound traffic.

According to their belief, the Quran is the divine word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. Although the physical writing of the Quran was done by human scribes under Muhammad's guidance, Muslims believe that the content and the message within the Quran came directly from God.

With a new family member on the way, they needed more space not only for the baby's room, but also to accommodate friends and family who would surely come to visit the newest addition to their family. Step 1: Assessing their needs regarding space and amenities. Before making any decisions, they carefully assessed their needs and determined that a house with a minimum of three bedrooms, a spacious living area, and a yard would be ideal. Step 2: Setting a budget. Budgeting was crucial to ensure they could afford a new home without incurring too much debt. They took into account their current savings, monthly income, and the potential costs involved in raising a child. Step 3: Researching potential neighborhoods. They researched various neighborhoods, considering factors like proximity to schools, safety, and community amenities such as parks and playgrounds. They wanted to ensure they chose a great place to raise their child. Step 4: Hiring a real estate agent. To streamline the home buying process, they hired a real estate agent who had expertise in the neighborhoods they were interested in. The agent helped them find a suitable home that met their requirements and budget. Step 5: Viewing multiple homes. Over the course of a few weeks, they visited several houses with their agent, carefully weighing the pros and cons of each property. They considered factors like room layout, potential for renovations, and the overall feel of the neighborhood. Step 6: Making an offer and negotiating. Once they found the perfect house for their growing family, they made an offer through their real estate agent. After some back-and-forth negotiations, the price was settled, and they signed a purchase agreement. Step 7: Securing financing. They applied for a mortgage, and, due to their solid credit history and financial stability, they were approved for a loan that covered the purchase price of the house. Step 8: Inspecting the house. Before closing the deal, they hired a professional home inspector to thoroughly evaluate the property and identify any potential issues. This ensured they wouldn't encounter any costly surprises down the road. Step 9: Closing the deal and moving in. After all necessary inspections and paperwork were completed, they closed on the house and began the moving process. They packed up their belongings from the apartment and hired a moving company to transport everything to their new home. Step 10: Settling into their new home and preparing for the baby. After moving in and unpacking, they began nesting for the arrival of their baby. They set up a cozy nursery and started purchasing all essential baby items.

But a court martial last month in Colchester heard the blow was aimed at his colleague's head. Farrell, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, was convicted of attempted murder. The court heard claims that Mr Horbury was the \\"ringleader\\" of a gang of trainees who were bullying Farrell, which had culminated in the attack on 13 November. Farrell said he had no intention of hitting him with the knife and just wanted to scare him to make him leave him alone. He said on the night in question he was verbally bullied and went out to a smoking area to calm down, but \\"lost it\\" when he came back and saw Mr Horbury \\"smirking\\" at him. The court heard \\"it was only by chance\\" Mr Horbury was not killed. He managed to dodge the blow by rolling out of the way. Sentencing Farrell at Colchester Garrison, Vice-Judge Advocate General Michael Hunter told him: \\"You reacted in the way you did because you were being verbally bullied and because you couldn't take it.\\" Describing it as an \\"unusual\\" case in which nobody was injured, he said: \\"Following that blow, instead of retrieving the knife and continuing your actions you took no further action. \\"You did nothing.

Die strukturelle Transformation hat in vielerlei Hinsicht eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Analyse und Erforschung der modernen politischen Systeme gespielt. Die Kritik an der Demokratie in westfälischen Staaten basiert auf der Idee, dass nationale politische Ordnungen und Souveränität immer noch das vorherrschende Paradigma darstellen, während sie gleichzeitig verkennen, wie sich diese Ordnungen in einer sich verändernden globalen Landschaft in Bezug auf nationale Identität, Demokratie und Legitimität entwickeln und transformieren. Die strukturelle Transformation zielt darauf ab, tiefere Fragen zur Funktionsweise von Demokratie in westfälischen Staaten zu stellen, indem sie sich mit Themen wie sozialer Ungleichheit, Globalisierung, technologischem Wandel und der Verschiebung der geopolitischen Machtverhältnisse auseinandersetzt. Diese Fragen werden oft übersehen oder ignoriert, da sie nicht so leicht in das traditionelle Verständnis von Demokratie und politischer Ordnung passen. Im Detail versucht die Strukturelle Transformation, die Spannungen und Widersprüche zwischen den verschiedenen politischen und sozialen Akteuren innerhalb eines Staates zu untersuchen. Einerseits gibt es die traditionellen politischen Eliten, die versuchen, ihre Macht und Hegemonie aufrechtzuerhalten, indem sie bestehende Hierarchien und Institutionen bewahren. Andererseits gibt es soziale Gruppen und Bewegungen, die durch ihre eigenen Kämpfe und Forderungen die bestehenden politischen und sozialen Machtverhältnisse herausfordern. Die Analyse dieser Dynamiken erlaubt es uns, ein besseres Verständnis dafür zu entwickeln, wie das demokratische Leben in westfälischen Staaten gestaltet wird, wie es sich verändert, und welche Bedeutung dies für die Beteiligung der Bürgerinnen und Bürger hat. Durch die Betrachtung von Themen wie sozialer Ungleichheit und der Rolle von politischen Eliten kann die Strukturelle Transformation dazu beitragen, kritische Perspektiven zu entwickeln, die die bestehenden politischen Systeme in Frage stellen und alternative Visionen einer gerechteren und sozial verantwortlicheren politischen Ordnung fördern. Insgesamt trägt die Strukturelle Transformation zur Kritik an der tatsächlich existierenden Demokratie in westfälischen Staaten bei, indem sie uns dazu anregt, über die Grenzen und Möglichkeiten der politischen Ordnung im 21.

The Nintendo DS or simply, DS, is a 32-bit dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo. The device went on sale in North America on November 21, 2004. The DS, short for \\"Developers' System\\" or \\"Dual Screen\\", introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one featuring a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity. Both screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-closed Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony's PlayStation Portable as part of the seventh generation era. It was likened to the Nintendo 64 from the 1990s, which led to several N64 ports such as \\"Super Mario 64 DS\\", \\"Diddy Kong Racing DS\\", among others. Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental, \\"third pillar\\" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to the Game Boy series. On March 2, 2006, Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi, another redesign with several hardware improvements and new features.

When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron).

A: A:","output":"Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, it provides a way to quantify the amount of disorder present in a system. It was first introduced by the physicist Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics states that in an isolated system, natural processes tend to progress in a direction that leads to an increase in disorder or randomness, also known as an increase in entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations a system can have, given its macroscopic properties such as temperature, volume, and energy. In simpler terms, it accounts for the variety of ways particles can be arranged or distributed among individual energy levels. A system with a low entropy value has only a few possible states, which means the particles are organized and structured. On the other hand, a system with a high entropy value has many possible states, which means the particles are disordered and less structured. It is crucial to note that entropy is not an inherent property of an object or a system, but rather depends on the observer's choice of macroscopic variables to describe the system. In this sense, an increase in entropy can be understood as an increase in the amount of information needed to describe a system fully. In practical applications, entropy often helps scientists and engineers understand and predict various processes that involve the transfer of heat, such as heat engines, refrigeration cycles, and heat pumps. It can also be applied in other fields, including information theory, where entropy represents the minimum amount of data required to transmit a message optimally, and in the study of complex systems, where entropy can describe the level of uncertainty or instability present in those systems. Overall, entropy is a crucial concept that allows scientists to quantify and analyze the degree of disorder in various systems. By understanding and predicting the way systems evolve from order to chaos, researchers can better understand the fundamental properties of our universe and develop more effective technologies for harnessing and controlling energy."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: A commandery consisted of a group of counties, and was headed by an Administrator.

However, with the rise of the Ottomans, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, they lost most of these, such as Cyprus and Euboea to the Turks. Between 1645 and 1669, the Venetians and the Ottomans fought a long and costly war over the last major Venetian possession in the Aegean, Crete. During this war, the Venetian commander, Francesco Morosini, came into contact with the rebellious Maniots, for a joint campaign in the Morea. In 1659, Morosini landed in the Morea, and together with the Maniots, he took Kalamata. However, he was soon after forced to return to Crete, and the Peloponnesian venture failed. In 1683, a new war broke out between Austria and the Ottomans, with a large Ottoman army advancing towards Vienna. In response to this, a Holy League was formed. After the Ottoman army was defeated in the Battle of Vienna, the Venetians decided to use the opportunity of the weakening of Ottoman power and its distraction in the Danubian front so as to reconquer its lost territories in the Aegean and Dalmatia. On 25 April 1684, the Most Serene Republic declared war on the Ottomans. Aware that she would have to rely on her own strength for success, Venice prepared for the war by securing financial and military aid in men and ships from the Knights of Malta, the Duchy of Savoy, the Papal States, and the Knights of St. Stephen. In addition, the Venetians enrolled large numbers of mercenaries from Italy and the German states, especially Saxony and Brunswick. Question: What happened second: Morosini took Kalamata or the Battle of Vienna? Answer:","output":"The second event that happened was the Battle of Vienna. To provide a clear understanding, let's look at the chronological order of these two events: 1. Morosini took Kalamata: This event occurred in 1659 when the Venetian commander, Francesco Morosini, joined forces with the rebellious Maniots for a joint campaign in the Morea. Together, they captured the city of Kalamata. 2. Battle of Vienna: This battle took place later, on September 12, 1683, between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, which had formed the Holy League with support from various European countries, including Venice. The Ottoman forces were defeated in this battle, which marked a significant turning point in the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the European powers.

Answer: Penicillin, an antibiotic discovered by Scottish biologist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, played a pivotal role during World War II by saving the lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians who were suffering from bacterial infections. Prior to the introduction of penicillin, bacterial infections were a leading cause of death in warfare, and many soldiers succumbed to their wounds or infections that were once considered untreatable. Fleming's discovery of penicillin's bacteria-killing properties led to the realization that it could be used as a powerful therapeutic agent against a wide range of bacterial infections. However, it was not until the early 1940s that its true potential for medical use was exploited, thanks to the coordinated efforts of scientists worldwide who engaged in massive research and production efforts in response to the global conflict. Under the pressure of World War II, British scientists Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, along with other researchers in the United States, developed a method of mass-producing this life-saving drug by cultivating large volumes of the Penicillium mold. As a result, by 1943, sufficient quantities of penicillin were available to treat wounded soldiers on the battlefields. The antibiotic was particularly effective in treating infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci, which were common in the war setting. The widespread use of penicillin during World War II had a profound impact on medical history. For the first time, physicians had a means to combat life-threatening bacterial infections that previously resulted in high mortality rates. The introduction of this \\"miracle drug\\" led to a dramatic decline in deaths related to pneumonia, gonorrhea, meningitis, and other bacterial infections. Moreover, the success of penicillin paved the way for the development and discovery of other antibiotics in the post-war period, such as streptomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. The era of antibiotics has made it possible to cure or manage a wide range of previously fatal conditions, significantly improving the overall quality of life and expanding life expectancy worldwide. In summary, penicillin played a vital role in World War II by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections, ultimately saving countless lives during the conflict. Its discovery and subsequent widespread use revolutionized the field of medicine by ushering in the era of antibiotics, profoundly influencing healthcare and transforming the way bacterial infections are managed and treated globally."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the last names of the two individuals who were to maintain a correspondence over thirty years? is inside the article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The last names of the two individuals who were to maintain a correspondence over thirty years are Nielsen and Busoni.

Choices: - own home - cold room - suburb - nursing home - own house The rationale to choose \\"own house\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The small dog most likely wanted its own house. This is because the context provided in the question indicates that the dog is outside, observing a warm home and a happy family. It is reasonable to assume that the dog desires a similar sense of comfort, security, and companionship within a home. The rationale for choosing \\"own house\\" instead of the other options listed is as follows: 1. Own home: \\"Own home\\" and \\"own house\\" can be considered quite similar, but \\"own house\\" specifically implies a dedicated space for the dog, whereas \\"own home\\" could refer to a shared living situation. Both options suggest the dog wants a place to call its own, but \\"own house\\" leans more towards a secure and personal space. 2. Cold room: A \\"cold room\\" does not align with the warm and happy environment the dog is observing. The dog is likely to desire the warmth and coziness of a home, rather than a cold and potentially uncomfortable space. 3. Suburb: A \\"suburb\\" is a residential area, which may include many homes, and doesn't distinctly imply a specific living situation for the dog. Additionally, a suburb doesn't necessarily guarantee the dog will find the warmth, love, and companionship it seeks. 4. Nursing home: A nursing home is a facility for elderly or disabled individuals to receive care. While dogs can provide therapeutic benefits to people in nursing homes, it's not clear from the context that the dog is seeking this type of environment specifically. In conclusion, given the context of the question, \\"own house\\" is the most suitable answer since it implies the dog's desire for a warm, secure, and loving environment to call its own."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain's rich heritage of traditional dance and music.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music any more so it's dying out. \\" is true?","output":"Step 1: Begin by analyzing the given premise. The premise states that \\"Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain's rich heritage of traditional dance and music.\\" This indicates that there is an increasing interest in traditional Spanish dance and music among people of various age groups. Step 2: Compare the hypothesis with the premise. The hypothesis states that \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music any more so it's dying out.\\" This statement suggests that the interest in traditional Spanish dance and music is decreasing and on the verge of disappearing. Step 3: Assess the logical consistency between the hypothesis and the premise. As per our analysis of the premise, there is growing interest in traditional Spanish dance and music across generations. The hypothesis contradicts this observation, as it claims that interest in this cultural manifestation is dying out. Step 4: Determine the validity of the hypothesis. Given that the hypothesis contradicts the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music any more so it's dying out.\\" is true.

Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

The warming of the planet due to greenhouse gases leads to the extinction of natural habitats, resulting in a reduction of wildlife population. With increased anthropogenic gas emissions as proposed by Jessica, the negative effects of global warming would be exacerbated, leading to a further decrease in the number of animals."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

From start to finish, the movie keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with its fascinating storyline, powerful performances, and stunning visuals. The film tells the story of two families living in South Korea: the destitute Kim family, who reside in a dingy, semi-basement apartment and struggle to make ends meet, and the wealthy Park family, who enjoy the luxuries of their magnificent modern home. As the plot unfolds, the Kims cunningly infiltrate the Park family's sacred domain by assuming the roles of indispensable employees, and in doing so, they expose the glaring disparities between the haves and the have-nots. Bong Joon-ho's direction is nothing short of spectacular. He expertly utilizes the film's set design, cinematography, and editing to create distinct visual layers that mirror the class divisions within the story. The contrast between the cramped, dimly-lit quarters of the Kims' dwelling and the bright, spacious, and pristine Park residence works to accentuate the well-established themes of social inequality and class struggle. At the heart of \\"Parasite\\" is an ensemble of outstanding performances. Song Kang-ho, who plays the Kim family patriarch, delivers a multifaceted portrayal of a desperate man forced into an increasingly precarious situation. His performance is matched by those of Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong, who effectively capture the aloofness and obliviousness of their affluent counterparts. Younger cast members, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring a fresh and dynamic energy to the film while further demonstrating the dire circumstances faced by the younger generation. While \\"Parasite\\" is often dark and tense, it's also surprisingly humorous, with sardonic wit and situational comedy helping to alleviate some of its darker elements. The humor not only bolsters the film's entertainment factor but also imbues it with an unmistakable sense of originality, setting it apart from many other features that have tackled similar themes. \\"Parasite\\" is a dazzling cinematic achievement that manages to be both a razor-sharp satire on the enduring struggles of class-based society and a thrilling, highly entertaining film in its own right. With its mesmerizing story, powerful performances, and impeccable direction, it's no wonder this film has garnered critical acclaim and a multitude of prestigious awards, including the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Picture. In conclusion, \\"Parasite\\" is an essential viewing experience for film enthusiasts and casual moviegoers alike. Its expertly crafted narrative, captivating visuals, and social commentary not only make it a compelling cinematic experience but also ensure its enduring relevance and impact for years to come."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -3*t + 13*t + 70 = 0 for t.","output":"To solve the given linear equation -3*t + 13*t + 70 = 0 for the variable t, we'll follow these steps: 1. Simplify and rewrite the equation. 2. Isolate the variable t. 3. Solve for t. Let's break down each step: Step 1: Simplify and rewrite the equation. Combine the terms with the same variable, t. -3*t + 13*t = (13 - 3) * t = 10*t So, now the simplified equation becomes: 10*t + 70 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable t. To isolate the t variable, we need to move 70 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 70 from both sides of the equation. 10*t + 70 - 70 = 0 - 70 10*t = -70 Step 3: Solve for t. Now, in order to find the value of t, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 10. 10*t / 10 = -70 / 10 t = -7 So, the solution for the given linear equation -3*t + 13*t + 70 = 0 for the variable t is: t = -7"},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Rice Boat, eatType = restaurant, food = French, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes.

Recorded originally by Willie Mae \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton on August 13, 1952, in Los Angeles and released by Peacock Records in late February 1953, \\"Hound Dog\\" was Thornton's only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Context: Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\". In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored. When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\" Philip H. Ennis sees \\"Two Hound Dogs\\", which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley & His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton's recording. While not an answer record in the traditional sense, the lyric characterized \\"Rhythm\\" and \\"Blues\\" as the titular \\"Two Hound Dogs,\\" an apparent testament to the stature of \\"Hound Dog.\\" Question: Did anyone get sued over that song?. Whats the answer?","output":"Although there were various recordings that used a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\" without attribution to Leiber and Stoller, there are no clear records of any lawsuits specifically related to these songs. It is worth noting, though, that there was a lawsuit regarding Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat,\\" which was an answer song to \\"Hound Dog.\\" In 1953, Sun Records released \\"Bear Cat\\" and faced legal action from the publishers of \\"Hound Dog,\\" who claimed copyright infringement. Sun Records and its owner, Sam Phillips, ultimately lost the case. As for the other aforementioned songs like Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy's \\"Country Boy\\", and the anonymous acetate \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\", there are no records of lawsuits tied to them in relation to \\"Hound Dog.\\" However, it's mentioned in the context of \\"Juicehead\\" that if it indeed originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it could have led to another lawsuit, given the previous legal action involving \\"Bear Cat.\\""},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Calculate the cost of the peripherals. 2. Calculate the cost of the new video card. 3. Calculate the difference in cost between the old and new video card. 4. Add the costs from steps 1-3 to the base computer cost to find the total amount spent. Step 1: Calculate the cost of the peripherals. John's computer costs 1500, and the peripherals cost 1/5 that much. So, to find the cost of these peripherals, we need to multiply: 1500 * (1/5) = 300 This means that the peripherals will cost 300. Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new video card. The base computer comes with a 300 video card, but John wants one that costs twice as much. We need to multiply the base video card's cost by 2 to find out the cost of the new video card: 300 * 2 = 600 The new video card he wants to purchase costs 600. Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the old and new video card. John will replace the base video card, so we need to find the difference in cost between the old and new video card: 600 - 300 = 300 There is a 300 difference in cost that John needs to pay for the new video card. Step 4: Add the costs from steps 1-3 to the base computer cost to find the total amount spent. Now, we will add the cost of the peripherals, the cost difference for the video card, and the cost of the base computer to find out the total amount John spent: 1500 (base computer) + 300 (peripherals) + 300 (video card difference) = 2100 John spent a total of 2100 on the new computer, the monitor and other peripherals, and the upgraded video card."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Draw a big circle to outline her upper skull.

Known for her quirky and fabulous style, Draculaura is the daughter of the legendary Count Dracula. A versatile character like her is sure to spark creativity when it comes to drawing. If you've always wanted to learn how to draw Draculaura, then this step-by-step guide will lead you through the process. Even if you're a beginner, these instructions will help you create an impressive piece of artwork featuring Draculaura in her signature look. Step 1: Outline her upper skull Begin by drawing a large circle to represent the top part of Draculaura's skull. This will serve as the base for her face. Ensure that the circle is even and smooth, as it will become the foundation for the rest of the drawing. Step 2: Add guidelines for the face Inside the circle, create two perpendicular guidelines for Draculaura's face. Draw a vertical line to divide the circle into two equal halves. This will help you find the center of her face and maintain symmetry. Then, add a horizontal line about halfway down the circle to indicate the placement of her eyes. Step 3: Complete the jaw Using the guidelines as a reference, draw the shape of Draculaura's jaw and chin. Follow the curve of the circle for her cheekbones, but then narrow it down as you approach the chin, giving her a heart-shaped face. Step 4: Add body, hair, and ears Sketch her neck by drawing two vertical lines extending from the base of her jaw. Next, draw a basic outline of her upper body, including her shoulders and torso. For her hair, draw wavy lines extending from her head, framing her face and flowing down behind her shoulders. Don't forget to add her signature bangs and two-pointed ears. Step 5: Add limbs and legs Draw the arms extending from her shoulders, with bent elbows and hands resting on her hips. Sketch the basic shape of her legs, which should be slender and elongated. Remember to draw Draculaura in her signature pose, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Step 6: Add hands Sketch the basic shape of Draculaura's hands and fingers. Her hands should be delicate and slender, with long, elegant fingers. It's essential to pay attention to detail here, as hands can be a particularly challenging aspect of drawing. Step 7: Draw the face and clothing details Now it's time to focus on Draculaura's facial features. With the help of the guidelines, draw her eyes, nose, and mouth. Give her a playful and fun expression, with arched eyebrows and a smile. Add her iconic heart-shaped beauty mark under her left eye. For her clothing, draw her fashionable outfit, typically composed of a dress or a blouse and skirt combination. Consider adding accessories like her stylish necklace, belt, and earrings. Step 8: Using a pen, draw on top of your sketch Once you're satisfied with the pencil sketch, trace the drawing with a fine-tip pen or marker. This will help emphasize the final lines and bring your illustration to life. Be careful not to smudge the ink while tracing. Step 9: Erase the pencil sketch and add details Gently erase the pencil sketch from your drawing, making sure not to damage the inked lines. This will leave you with a clean illustration of Draculaura. You can now add more details, such as textures and patterns on her clothing or refining her facial features. Step 10: Color Draculaura Finally, bring Draculaura to life by coloring her. She's known for her adore for pink and black-themed outfits, along with her two-toned hair (black and pink). Choose vibrant colors for her skin and clothing, paying attention to the shading and highlights to give depth and dimension to your drawing. Conclusion: Drawing Draculaura from Monster High can be a fun and rewarding activity, especially with the help of this detailed step-by-step guide. Practice your skills, experiment with different poses and outfits, and you'll soon find yourself creating impressive illustrations of your favorite Monster High character!"},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Je mange une pomme.

Possible A: kitchen, plate, dinning, stomach, pantry Why is \\"plate\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Plate\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. In most cultures and social settings, food is generally served, presented, and consumed from plates, making it the most relatable and accurate answer among the given options. Let's analyze each option to understand why \\"plate\\" is the best choice. 1. Kitchen: The kitchen is typically where food is prepared and cooked. While the kitchen is an essential part of the process, it is not the last place where food is before being eaten. The food must be served into a more specific vessel, like a plate or a bowl, before consumption. Therefore, the kitchen is not the most reasonable answer. 2. Plate: As mentioned earlier, the plate is where food is often served and presented before being eaten. In various cultures, food items are placed on plates to provide adequate portions for consumption, making the process of eating hygienic, clean, and organized. Plates are also used as a specific physical location for one's meal. Given these considerations, \\"plate\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense. 3. Dining: \\"Dining\\" is an activity rather than a location. It usually refers to the act of eating food or the location where people eat, such as the dining room or dining table. While dining is related to the consumption of food, it doesn't specify the precise spot where food is placed before being eaten, such as a plate. 4. Stomach: The stomach is an internal organ in humans' and certain animals' bodies involved in the digestion of food. Since the question is about the \\"last place food is before being eaten,\\" the stomach cannot be an answer aligned with human common sense. The food has already been eaten once it reaches the stomach. 5. Pantry: A pantry is a storage area, usually a room or cabinet, where food items are kept before being prepared and cooked. While it may hold food, it is not the last place food is before being eaten. The food still needs to go through the preparation, cooking, and serving processes. In conclusion, considering the given options, \\"plate\\" is the best answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most common and accurate location where food is placed before it is consumed. Plates are often used across different cultures and are integral to the act of eating, making them the most appropriate answer in this context."},{"instruction":"Cameron asked the man a favor to go get some food for his starving dog.

Make this lower case","output":"these revolutionary developments open up new possibilities in the field of additive manufacturing. Revolutionary developments in the field of additive manufacturing have opened up a plethora of new possibilities and opportunities. Additive manufacturing, also commonly known as 3D printing, has been transforming industries with its innovative techniques that allow for more efficient and customized production. A traditional manufacturing process involves cutting, shaping, and assembling materials to create a finished product, often resulting in a significant amount of waste. On the other hand, additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer by depositing materials precisely where they are needed, thus reducing waste and improving efficiency. There are several key developments in additive manufacturing that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible: 1. Advanced materials: The introduction of new and improved materials has allowed for an expansion of applications, making it possible to create stronger and lightweight products. Materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, metal alloys, and even biodegradable materials are now being used in 3D printing, unlocking a wide range of potential uses. 2. Multi-material printing: 3D printers are now capable of processing multiple materials in one build, thus creating objects with a diverse set of properties. This development has opened up new opportunities in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medicine, where the combination of materials can be used to create more effective products. 3. Improved accuracy and resolution: Technological advancements in the printing process have led to higher levels of precision and resolution in the final product. This development is especially significant in industries like aerospace, where minute details make a significant difference in terms of safety, performance, and efficiency. 4. Faster production: Innovations in the additive manufacturing process have resulted in a considerable decrease in production time. With the development of printers that can create objects at an exceedingly rapid pace, it becomes much more feasible for companies to bring their products to market more quickly. 5. Mass customization: Additive manufacturing allows for greater customization without requiring additional time or costs, giving consumers tailored products at prices comparable to those of mass-produced items. This gives companies a competitive edge, allowing them to cater to individual customer needs more effectively. 6. Reduced waste and environmental impact: As mentioned earlier, additive manufacturing significantly cuts down on waste as compared to traditional production methods. It also reduces the need for transportation of goods by allowing for localized production, which can further decrease the industry's carbon footprint. 7. Bio-printing: One of the most exciting applications of additive manufacturing is the ability to 3D print living tissue and cells. This has enormous potential in the field of regenerative medicine, paving the way for advancements such as lab-grown organs, personalized drugs, and improved prosthetics. 8.

Although it is a community gathering place, it is not a location where someone can typically receive adequate medical care for physical distress. 2. For help: The phrase \\"for help\\" is a general direction and does not specify a particular location where one should go. It is crucial to determine a specific place where someone can receive assistance for their physical distress. 3. Hospital: A hospital is a facility that provides medical care and treatment for various health issues. It is staffed by trained medical professionals who can address physical distress, diagnose issues, and administer proper care to alleviate symptoms. 4.

In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean \\"Motherfuckah\\" Jones (Foxx), an ex-con who agrees to be their \\"murder consultant\\". Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents. The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having...

Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What type of news fails to fill the gap?\\" can be derived from the given statement: \\"An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet: 'The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press': It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.\\" In this case, the type of news that fails to fill the gap is the in-depth, well-funded, and investigative journalism that existed prior to the digital revolution. The disruption of traditional sources of funding for media outlets has made it difficult for these organizations to maintain the resources and staffing necessary to conduct comprehensive reporting. While the digital revolution and the growth of the Internet have undoubtedly been beneficial for the overall accessibility of news and information, it has also led to the decline in financial support for traditional news outlets and the growth of alternative online platforms. These new platforms often lack the funding, resources, and professional expertise that their more established counterparts have, thereby reducing the overall quality and depth of reported news. This decline has several negative implications. For one, it can lead to the favoring of sensational or superficial content over more meaningful reporting due to the need to generate clicks and online ad revenue. Additionally, the absence of a strong, well-funded press makes it increasingly difficult to hold those in power accountable through in-depth investigative journalism. In summary, the type of news that fails to fill the gap is the professionally produced, high-quality investigative journalism that has been negatively impacted by the disruption of traditional funding sources in the era of digital media. New forms of internet journalism, while valuable for freedom of expression and accessibility of information, have not effectively replaced the depth and quality of content that has been lost due to the decline in support for traditional media outlets."},{"instruction":"How shall I report a question?

Analyzing the first question: \\"How shall I report a question?\\" This question asks for guidance on reporting a question, but it doesn't specify the context or platform where the question is located. 2. Analyzing the second question: \\"How do I report an inappropriate question on Quora?\\" This question asks for guidance on reporting a specific type of question (inappropriate) on a specific platform (Quora). 3. Comparing the meanings: Both questions seek guidance on reporting a question, with the primary difference being that the second question specifies the context (inappropriate question on Quora) while the first question is more general.

How much does he spend in a week if he is closed 3 days a week? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Calculate how many pounds of crab meat Johnny uses per day. Johnny makes his signature crab dish 40 times a day, and each dish uses 1.5 pounds of crab meat. Therefore: 40 dishes * 1.5 pounds/dish = 60 pounds of crab meat per day 2. Calculate the cost of crab meat per day. Crab meat sells for 8 per pound. So, the cost of crab meat Johnny uses every day is: 60 pounds * 8/pound = 480 per day 3. Calculate how many days Johnny is open for business in a week. Johnny is closed 3 days a week, so he is open: 7 days in a week - 3 closed days = 4 open days 4. Calculate the total cost of crab meat Johnny spends in a week. Since Johnny spends 480 per day on crab meat and he is open 4 days a week, his weekly crab meat expense is: 480/day * 4 days = 1920 Johnny spends 1920 on crab meat in a week when he's open 4 days."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"The occurrence of snow days can indirectly impact a step of the process that leads to the formation of more powerful hurricanes. A snow day, by definition, is a day when a significant amount of snowfall occurs, resulting in disruptions to various activities including transportation, work, and school. Snow days generally occur during cold weather conditions, and their impact on hurricane formation can be understood through the lens of the broader climate system. Hurricanes are, essentially, large-scale weather systems fueled by the transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. Certain factors and conditions are necessary for the development of powerful hurricanes, including warm ocean waters, atmospheric moisture, and favorable wind patterns. When these conditions align, the process of hurricane formation, as outlined in the question, can occur. Now, let us consider snow days and their potential connection to hurricanes. Snow days typically occur in regions and during seasons characterized by colder temperatures. The prevalence of snow days can be linked to the overall climate of a region, which is in turn influenced by factors such as ocean currents, atmospheric circulation patterns, and the distribution of heat across the Earth's surface. Climate patterns and variability can have direct and indirect effects on the factors that contribute to hurricane formation. For instance, if a region is experiencing a significant number of snow days, the climate conditions in that area are likely characterized by cold temperatures and a general reduction in heat available for the development of weather systems such as hurricanes. This may also suggest that there is a possible shift in larger-scale weather patterns, which could influence the distribution of heat and moisture across the globe. If the overall global temperature becomes cooler, hurricanes could potentially be impacted by the reduced ocean temperature, diminishing the likelihood of intense hurricane formation. However, it is important to note that the relationship between snow days and hurricane intensity is not direct, since snow days do not directly influence any of the steps in the hurricane formation process mentioned in the question. Instead, they are an outcome of specific climate conditions, which in turn can influence the factors that contribute to the development of hurricanes. It can therefore be concluded that the perturbation, in this case, comes from an indirect impact on a step of the process. In summary, the occurrence of snow days can indirectly impact the process of hurricane formation by influencing the larger climate system, which in turn affects the factors necessary for creating powerful hurricanes. The perturbation is an indirect impact on a step of the process, rather than a direct impact or having no impact at all."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? most important and exhilarating","output":"In order to determine if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral, it's crucial to look at the context. However, based just on the phrase \\"most important and exhilarating,\\" one would generally align it with a positive sentiment. The term \\"important\\" on its own is neutral - neither positive nor negative. It just states the emphasis or priority on something, indicating its high value or significance, but in terms of sentiment, it is neutral; it doesn't express a good or bad feeling. However, the term \\"exhilarating\\" is often associated with a positive sentiment. It suggests a feeling of excitement, enthusiasm, and thrill. When something is described as \\"exhilarating,\\" it often generates a feeling of joy or anticipation. In the context of the terms together, \\"most important and exhilarating,\\" there’s almost an enhancement of the positivity due to the use of the term 'most'. The statement is not just labeling something as important and exhilarating, but the most important and exhilarating, which certainly emphasizes a very high degree of positivity due to the strength of the adjectives and the superlative ‘most’. Thus, although the phrase is lacking a fuller context to provide a complete certainty, based on the words given, it can be inferred that the sentiment is positive."},{"instruction":"- Someone is infected with bacteria - That bacteria begins to grow and reproduce inside the cells - The dividing bacteria begin to make toxins - Those toxins damage your cells What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process typically involves the body's immune response. Once the bacterial toxins have damaged the body cells, the immune system is triggered to counteract the bacterial infection. This includes the body increasing the production of white blood cells, antibodies, and other mechanisms that are designed to target and destroy the bacteria and their toxins.

The industry body, the Motion Picture Practitioners Association of Nigeria (Moppan), was responding to comments from many people including other Hausa actors. One of them, Nura Hussain, took to Instagram holding a sign calling for Ms Sadau's punishment. The picture got hundreds of comments supporting his demand. In Hausa culture, any open show of romance is frowned upon, and this was where Ms Sadau slipped up. But the actress also has her fans, some of whom have tried to fight back on social media setting up online groups to show their support. She herself has apologised to anyone she may have offended, but described what she did as \\"innocuous touching\\". And she seems less than remorseful, posting repeatedly on Snapchat a photo of herself being hugged by a man on her recent visit to India, where she was when the row erupted. A typical Kannywood film: As the film opens parents are seen discussing who their successful city-dwelling son should marry. They decide on a cousin who they deem meets all their expectations of a good wife. But there's a hitch, their urban, and urbane, son is in love with an educated city lady. He wants to marry her. The family confronts their son with their choice of wife for him. The dispute generates tension and finally the parents force their son to marry the cousin. He goes through with the wedding but stays in touch with his preferred partner. They go on romantic outings during which he mentions his loveless marriage. Throughout the film, dancing and singing punctuate the action. If there is to be any suggestion of sex, the screen will go dark. Ms Sadau speaks some Hindi, like many fans of Bollywood films in the mainly Muslim northern Nigeria where Indian cinema has been appreciated for years for its conservative values. Kannywood, which took off around 2000, is similar but more restrained. Its films would never go as far as Classiq's music video and show a man and a woman hugging, but even scenes showing young people expressing love towards each other have been deemed offensive by some. But this controversy has not emerged in a vacuum. Anger towards Kannywood actors and films has been building up for some time in Nigeria and the industry has been on the defensive. Islamic clerics in the north blame them for spreading immorality and bringing it into the home. Ms Sadau's video appearance proved their point. Parents say the films and the antics of the actors divert their children's attention from more important things. The recent problems can be traced back to 2010 when a video was leaked of a Hausa actress having sex with her boyfriend. Criticism from clerics has not let up. Earlier this year the government cancelled plans to build state-of-the-art film facilities in Kano state - from where the industry gets its name - after pressure from religious leaders, who said it would promote immorality. This is why the industry is keen to see that it is upholding a strict ethical code. And it appears as if Ms Sadau has been made an example of. Moppan said it hoped the ban would serve as a deterrent to other actors and actresses who are \\"expected to be good ambassadors of the society they represent\\". Its chairman, Muhammadu Kabiru Maikaba, told the BBC Hausa service that this \\"was not the first time that she has been doing these wayward things. We have been warning her, but she still went ahead to dent out image\\". What has happened to her has grabbed the attention as she is currently one of the best known faces of Kannywood. She emerged in 2013, featuring in films alongside the industry's big names, and became famous for being adventurous and daring in her films Her profile was raised further following commercial endorsements from various companies. In 2015, she was embroiled in a row after she accused popular actor Adam Zango of sexual harassment. Mr Zango denied the accusation. But this year's row may have topped that as she has come in for some vitriolic abuse. Some of Ms Sadau's defenders have said that she is being picked on because she is a woman. They point to pictures of Kannywood actors where they are seen hugging women and argue that they have not been castigated in a similar manner. The actress has urged people to calm down and said that people should be \\"more tolerant and forgiving towards one another and to cease the senseless abuse, name calling and backbiting\\". But this row, whatever the outcome, is unlikely to be the last time that morality and ethics get debated when it comes to Kannywood movies. With the proliferation of satellite channels showing Hausa films and smartphones on which people can download clips the battle between the vanguards of morality and Kannywood may have only just begun.

Movie title: Vertical Limit Movie plot: While climbing in Monument Valley, siblings Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie Garrett (Tunney) lose their father, Royce (Stuart Wilson). After two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing, becoming a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope. Three years later, during a wildlife photo shoot for National Geographic in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan, Peter's assistant falls and breaks his leg and has to be evacuated by the Pakistani Army stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches. Peter is dropped off at K2 Base Camp and searches for Annie who is planning a summit attempt on K2, the world's second highest and most dangerous mountain. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton) who is also taking part as he wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time after his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor. Vaughn has the help of renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and other expedition members include Pakistani mountaneer Ali Nazir. The day before the climb Vaughn throws a promotional party with all the people at base camp that is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick (Glenn), reported to be the world's best climber and foremost expert on K2, who asks if it will be Vaughn or the experienced McLaren who will be making the decisions during the climb, as the team cannot have two leaders. Vaughn states that McLaren is the leader and later on explains that Wick is against him because his wife, a Sherpa guide, was one of the people who did not survive his previous expedition. During that climb, they were hit by a storm and got lost in the mountain and Wick's wife died of pulmonary edema on their way down because she forgot her supply of dexamethasone, the only medicine...

The history of football has seen its fair share of magnificent punters, capable of changing the course of a match with just the swing of their legs. Eddie Royal, a former American football player, had a successful career full of memorable punts run in for a score, warranting a closer look at his accomplishments. Who is Eddie Royal? Edward Jones \\"Eddie\\" Royal was born on May 21, 1986, in Alexandria, Virginia. A versatile footballer, Royal played both as a wide receiver and return specialist throughout his collegiate and professional career. At Westfield High School, he was an All-American punt returner and played wide receiver, cornerback, and running back. Later, he earned a scholarship to Virginia Tech, where he became a valuable asset to the Hokies football team. Moving on to his professional career, the Denver Broncos drafted Eddie Royal as the 42nd overall pick in the 2nd round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He went on to have stints with the Broncos and the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers), with his last season in 2015 with the Chicago Bears. Returning Punts for Touchdowns In the world of football, running in a punt for a score is no easy feat. However, Royal managed to make quite a name for himself with his ability to return punts for touchdowns. Throughout his professional career, he ran in three punts for a score. Here's a closer look at these incredible moments: 1. September 14, 2008 - Denver Broncos vs. San Diego Chargers In just his second game as a rookie, Royal showcased his punt-return skills. An intense encounter between the Broncos and Chargers witnessed Royal running a punt back for a 71-yard touchdown, earning him the title of AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Notably, this game ended with a controversial finish where the Broncos edged their opponents 39-38. 2. November 27, 2011 - Denver Broncos vs. San Diego Chargers Fast-forward a few years, and Royal shined again in a Broncos-Chargers encounter. This time he returned a punt for a staggering 85-yard touchdown run. In addition to the impressive punt return, he scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime, giving the Broncos a 16-13 victory. 3. September 9, 2012 - San Diego Chargers vs. Oakland Raiders Ironically, the very team that inspired Eddie Royal to break records would witness him display his prodigious talent in their colors. Royal now turned alongside the Chargers against the Oakland Raiders, where he dazzled with a 71-yard punt return touchdown, contributing significantly to the Chargers' PRICELESS_TA37-29 victory. Conclusion Eddie Royal, a player who left an indelible impact on NFL fans, showcased an exceptional ability in punt returns, amassing an impressive total of three touchdowns throughout his career. While his feats may not place him among the top punt returners in NFL history, he certainly made his mark with memorable moments and dramatic game-changers that football fans will never forget."},{"instruction":"Fragaria × vescana is a hybrid strawberry cultivar that was created in an effort to combine the best traits of the garden strawberry (\\"Fragaria\\" × \\"ananassa\\"), which has large berries and vigorous plants, with the woodland strawberry (\\"Fragaria vesca\\"), which has an exquisite flavour, but small berries.

A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder.

Israel, a country located in the Middle East, has a complex and multifaceted history that dates back thousands of years. Known as the biblical Holy Land, Israel has deep historical and religious ties to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths. This rich history has played a significant role in shaping Israel's political, cultural, and socio-economic landscape. The region known as Israel today was inhabited by ancient civilizations such as the Canaanites and Philistines. In the second millennium BCE, a group of people called the Israelites emerged, who believed they were the chosen people of God. Their history was recorded in the Hebrew Bible, forming the religious and cultural foundation for the Jewish people. Throughout ancient history, the area's strategic location led to numerous invasions and conquests by various empires such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. These successive invasions and cultural exchanges had a profound impact on the development of the region. The destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE marked the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora, when Jews were scattered across different regions and nations. During this time, the region was predominantly Christian under the Byzantine Empire, followed by the Islamic Caliphate's dominion from the 7th century onwards. The Crusades marked another tumultuous period in the region's history, as Christian Europeans sought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslims. This conflict and constant struggle for control persisted for centuries. The region eventually became part of the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century, where it remained until the end of World War I. The modern state of Israel has its roots in the 19th and 20th centuries when European Jews called for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in their ancestral lands. This movement, called Zionism, gained momentum following decades of persecution and the horrors of the Holocaust in Europe. The end of World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire provided an opportunity for the establishment of a Jewish state. The British Mandate for Palestine, granted by the League of Nations in 1922, aimed to facilitate the establishment of a Jewish national home while respecting the rights of the Arab population. Between the 1920s and 1940s, Jewish immigration to Palestine intensified due to Holocaust and increasing persecution in Europe. This immigration, combined with land purchases and the growth of the Jewish community, led to increased tensions between Jews and Arabs in the region. In 1947, the United Nations proposed the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by Arab states and Palestinian leaders. Consequently, in 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the independence of Israel, which triggered the first Arab-Israeli war. Since its establishment, Israel has faced ongoing conflict with its Arab neighbors and the broader Muslim world. The country fought several wars, including the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973. These conflicts led to territorial gains for Israel, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains central to the region's political landscape, with Palestinian demands for self-determination, statehood, and the right of return for refugees. This conflict has had a substantial impact on the socio-economic conditions of both Israelis and Palestinians and driven international efforts to broker peace agreements. Despite these challenges, Israel has developed a strong economy and vibrant society. Much of its economic success is attributed to its high-tech industries, agriculture, and innovation. Furthermore, Israel's diverse population, consisting of Jews from many different backgrounds and a significant Arab minority, has contributed to a rich cultural tapestry. In summary, the history of Israel has played a significant role in shaping its current political, cultural, and socio-economic circumstances. From ancient civilizations and religious history to modern conflicts and its position as a global leader in technology, Israel’s complex history continues to influence the development and direction of this unique Middle Eastern nation."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"Una frase en español es: \\"El gato juega con la pelota.\\" Explicación para un niño de cinco años: Escribí una oración en otro idioma llamado español, que significa \\"El gato juega con la pelota.\\" Aquí, \\"gato\\" es un animalito suave que dice \\"miau\\" y \\"pelota\\" es una cosa redonda con la que juegan los niños y los gatitos."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Where do you use a ball for exercise?

Given that the ratio of boys to girls is B, and the ratio of girls to boys is G. We can represent this as: Boys/Girls = B/1 and Girls/Boys = 1/G (since when the ratio of girls to boys is G, it means there is 1 girl for every G boys) Now, let's determine the value of 10(B + G) and figure out if it falls into any of the given categories. 10(B + G) = 10((Boys/Girls) + 1/G) Using the information that Boys/Girls = B/1, we can rewrite this equation as: 10(B + G) = 10((B/1) + (1/G)) If we let Boys = a and Girls = b, then we can rewrite the equations as: a/b = B/1 and b/a = 1/G Cross-multiplying yields: a = B*b and b = a/G Now, we can rewrite the expression 10(B + G) using these relationships: 10(B + G) = 10((a/b) + (b/a)) Let's find a common denominator for the expression inside the parentheses: 10(B + G) = 10((a^2 + b^2)/(ab)) Now we need to find an expression for 10(B + G) using only B and G. We can substitute a = B*b and b = a/G back into this equation: 10(B + G) = 10(((B*b)^2 + (a/G)^2)/(B*b * (a/G))) We can simplify the equation: 10(B + G) = 10(( (B^2b^2 + a^2/G^2)/ (aB) )) Now, let's observe the given options: (A) Equal to 3 (B) Less than 3 (C) More than 3 (D) Less than 1/3 (E) none of these We can consider some examples to check possibilities. 1. For the ratio of Boys to Girls as B = 2 and the ratio of Girls to Boys as G = 1/2: 10(B + G) = 10(2 + 1/2) = 10(5/2) = 25 In this case, 10(B + G) is more than 3. 2. For the ratio of Boys to Girls as B = 1/2 and the ratio of Girls to Boys as G = 2: 10(B + G) = 10(1/2 + 2) = 10(5/2) = 25 In this case, 10(B + G) is again more than 3. This shows that in most cases, 10(B + G) is more than 3. Therefore, the answer is: (C) More than 3"},{"instruction":"How do you say \\"The EU has no standing army.

What's the best answer to this question: is there a children's day in america?","output":"Yes, there is a Children's Day celebrated in the United States, albeit not at the national level and with varying dates and customs across different states and communities. Unlike Mother's Day and Father's Day, which are widely recognized and celebrated nationwide, Children's Day does not have a single, fixed annual observation across the entire country. Children's Day in the United States traces its origins back to the 19th century when the Reverend Dr. Charles Leonard initiated the first celebrations in 1857 by dedicating the second Sunday of June to children. This special day was originally called \\"Rose Day\\" and later \\"Flower Sunday.\\" Dr. Leonard intended the day to encourage people to appreciate and value the importance of children in society and promote their welfare. Despite there not being a uniform Children's Day celebration nationwide, several states and local communities have adopted their own versions of the observance. For instance, the state of Hawaii has designated the first Sunday in October as \\"Children and Youth Day.\\" On the other hand, the state of Mississippi observes \\"Child Health Day\\" on the first Monday of October, encouraging families and communities to promote the well-being of children. Various communities across the United States also hold their local celebrations with activities and events that focus on child development, education, health, and safety. These events may include parades, educational workshops, outdoor activities, and cultural performances, all designed to foster a productive and enjoyable atmosphere for children. In addition to individual states and communities, several international Children's Days are acknowledged and celebrated in the United States as well. The United Nations' Children's Day or Universal Children's Day, for example, takes place on November 20th, celebrating the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on that date in 1989. In summary, while there isn't a nationwide Children's Day in the United States like Mother's Day and Father's Day, the observance of children's welfare and well-being through various celebrations, events, and designated days are scattered throughout the country. The focus on children's happiness, education, and future remains a significant aspect of American culture that local as well as international observances continue to recognize and promote."},{"instruction":"Kali Michele Rocha (born December 5, 1971) is an American actress.

Sarah Sheffer reports. THE collapse of a bridge on an expressway in central China was likely caused by an explosion on a lorry carrying fireworks, a local official has said as state media reports the death toll is 11. The accident on Friday sent an 80-metre stretch of viaduct crashing to the ground and left the twisted remains of cars and lorries scattered among the rubble, once again raising questions over the safety of China's infrastructure. State television network CCTV today said 11 people had been killed in the accident and four arrested because the lorry was not permitted to carry explosives. An official with the Sanmenxia municipality's public security bureau named Zhang said rescuers using equipment to search for any more survivors had not detected any signs of life, warning that the toll could rise further. ''There are still vehicles buried in the rubble and we'll need heavy lifting equipment to get them out,'' he said. The municipality's deputy propaganda chief Ren Zhanzhou added that initial investigations suggested the lorry carrying firecrackers and fireworks ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays was the likely cause of the disaster. Drivers interviewed by CCTV said they saw an explosion before the bridge collapsed, but on popular internet forums, people were sceptical. ''Firecrackers and fireworks are not enough to destroy a bridge,'' one user identified as Xinghuhuhu wrote on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ''Have some respect for the dead, please! If a poor quality bridge is destroyed by firecrackers going off, it's not a question of a loss of face, some officials have to be fired,'' they added. ''There are times when you have to take responsibility.'' State-run China National Radio initially said on Friday that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure ''inexplicable''. Pictures of the accident showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned lorries with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4400 kilometres from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. It stands 30 metres above the ground, media reported. According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. ||||| At least eight killed as China bridge collapses (AFP) – Feb 1, 2013 BEIJING — A bridge on a major expressway in central China collapsed Friday, leaving the twisted remains of cars and trucks scattered among the rubble as state media reported at least eight fatalities. There was confusion over the toll, with the official news agency Xinhua saying eight people were dead and 13 injured after a fireworks-laden truck exploded, sending a long section of the viaduct crashing to the ground. State-run China National Radio initially said that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure \\"inexplicable\\". State broadcaster CCTV quoted nearby residents as saying they heard a loud booming noise, although it added the cause of the collapse was unclear and it was not known if the truck exploded before or after the bridge collapsed. Pictures showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned trucks with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. At least five cars could also be seen. CCTV said on its website that at least 25 vehicles were involved. A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4,400 kilometres (2,700 miles) from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. It stands 30 metres (yards) above the ground, media reported. Many of China's roads are packed as the country gears up for its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns in what is billed as the world's largest annual human migration. The season is also a peak period for fireworks producers, as Chinese traditionally buy the explosives to celebrate the festival, which falls on February 10 this year. According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. China has seen a number of bridge collapses in recent years, which are often blamed on overloading and shoddy construction. One such incident in northeast China last August killed three people.

Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay. Answer:","output":"Marion's girlfriend was left crippled by her drunken father, Frank, who caused a car accident that left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question, with explanation first. Choose the sentence that goes against common sense. Options: - Sentence A: \\"today i went to home\\" - Sentence B: \\"today i went to fire\\"","output":"To determine which sentence goes against common sense, let's analyze both options: - Sentence A: \\"today i went to home\\" This sentence indicates that the person went back to their place of residence. Despite the minor grammatical error (\\"I went home\\" would be more accurate), the sentence itself makes logical sense, as people do go home. - Sentence B: \\"today i went to fire\\" In this sentence, the person claims to have gone \\"to fire.\\" Fire is not a location or a place where someone can go; it is a combustion or burning process. Going \\"to fire\\" does not make logical sense, as people cannot simply go to an occurrence of fire the way they can go to a place. By analyzing both sentences, we find that Sentence B goes against common sense. It does not make logical sense because one cannot physically go \\"to fire\\" as if it were a place or location."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Idi Amin Dada (2816 August 2003) was the third president of Uganda, ruling from 1971 to 1979. Amin in 1946 joined the King's African Rifles, a British colonial regiment, serving in Kenya and Uganda. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Uganda People's Defense Force and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971 that deposed Milton Obote. While he was head of state, he promoted himself to field marshal. - The Ugandan Bush War (also known as the Luwero War, the Ugandan civil war or the Resistance War) refers to the guerrilla war waged between 1981 and 1986 in Uganda by the National Resistance Army (NRA) under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni against the government of Milton Obote, and later that of Tito Okello. - Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 10 October 2005) was a Ugandan political leader who led Uganda to independence in 1962 from British colonial administration. Following the nation's independence, he served as Prime Minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and President of Uganda from 1966 to 1971, then again from 1980 to 1985. He was overthrown by Idi Amin in 1971, but regained power after Amin's 1979 overthrow. His second period of rule was marred by repression and the deaths of many civilians as a result of a civil war known as the Ugandan Bush War. - Commander (French: \\"Commandeur\\") is a common naval and air force officer rank.

It performed both military and internal security functions within the colonial territory, and later served outside these territories during the World Wars. The rank and file (askaris) were drawn from native inhabitants, while most of the officers were seconded from the British Army. When the KAR was first raised there were some Sudanese officers in the battalions raised in Uganda, and native officers were commissioned towards the end of British colonial rule. - Robert \`\` Bob '' Astles ( born Robert Asketill , 23 March 1924 -- 29 December 2012 ) was a British soldier and colonial officer who lived in Uganda and became an associate of presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin . - Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world.

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \\" questionable utility. \\" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is. A:","output":"A: According to the article, which of the following strategies are NOT effective at managing a child's asthma and can lead to wasted expenses? 1.

His consolation was, that he was not again separated from his friends; Alberic, Sir Eric, and even Fru Astrida, accompanied him, as well as his constant follower, Osmond. Indeed, the Baron would hardly bear that he should be out of his sight; and he was still so carefully watched, that it was almost like a captivity. Never, even in the summer days, was he allowed to go beyond the Castle walls; and his guardians would fain have had it supposed that the Castle did not contain any such guest. Osmond did not give him so much of his company as usual, but was always at work in the armourer's forge--a low, vaulted chamber, opening into the Castle court.

Twitter users quickly began comparing Trump to Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort, reports the BBC, but Rowling was having none of it. \\"How horrible,\\" she tweeted. \\"Voldemort was nowhere near as bad.\\" Her comment was retweeted more than 50,000 times within hours and racked up almost as many likes. (By the way, you've been saying \\"Voldemort\\" incorrectly for years.) Expand this summary.","output":"Donald Trump, who is known for his controversial statements and harsh comments on Twitter, found himself on the receiving end of criticism from renowned author, J.K. Rowling. In December 2015, Trump proposed a \\"total and complete shutdown\\" of Muslims entering the United States. This sparked outrage among many, and Twitter users began comparing Trump to the infamous villain, Lord Voldemort, from Rowling's Harry Potter series. In response to this comparison, Rowling took to Twitter to defend her fictional character by stating, \\"How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad.\\" The author's retort received ample support from her followers, with her comment being retweeted over 50,000 times in a matter of hours and garnering almost as many likes. The comparison between Trump and Lord Voldemort was drawn due to the perceived similarities between the two in terms of their ideologies and divisive tactics. Lord Voldemort is a character despised by many for his evil intentions, narcissism, and lust for power. Trump's controversial statements regarding Muslims, immigration, and other sensitive topics have generated similar sentiments among a portion of the population. Rowling's tweet not only highlighted the extreme nature of Trump's proposal but also served as a means for the author to remind her readers of the importance of tolerance and acceptance. Lord Voldemort, as portrayed within the Harry Potter series, was a figure who believed in the superiority of pure-blood wizards and sought to eradicate those who did not fit his criteria. Consequently, the comparison to Trump, who has been accused of aligning with right-wing extremist groups and promoting discriminatory policies, is seen as a criticism of his political stance. The reaction to Rowling's tweet underscores the power of social media as a platform for the exchange of ideas and opinions, as well as its ability to amplify messages from influential voices. As a result of her tweet, the debate surrounding Trump's proposed Muslim ban was further fueled, and the conversation around the issue expanded. One interesting side note from the Rowling tweet incident was the revelation that many have been mispronouncing \\"Voldemort\\" for years. In the aftermath of the tweet, it came to light that the \\"t\\" in Voldemort is silent, properly pronounced as \\"Vol-de-more.\\" Rowling confirmed this to be the correct pronunciation through her Twitter interactions. In conclusion, J.K. Rowling's public comparison between Donald Trump and her fictional character Lord Voldemort generated widespread discussion about the then-presidential candidate's controversial policies and rhetoric. Her tweet served to highlight the divisive nature of Trump's proposals, while at the same time reinforcing the importance of accepting and respecting others, a key theme in her Harry Potter books."},{"instruction":"How does this story end?

It reels the audience in with the promise of breathtaking visuals and stirring performances, but its flimsy plot and uninspired dialogues leave viewers utterly underwhelmed and deeply disappointed. The film follows the story of an aspiring artist, Carl (Charlie Negative), who moves to the big city with dreams of making it in the cutthroat world of art galleries and high-society soirées. He develops an intense rivalry with fellow artist, Marcus (Max Misstep), and falls for the elusive Sophia (Amelia Overhype) along the way. Loosely based on a series of unfortunate cliches and a series of uninspired plot twists, the movie attempts to tackle themes of ambition, jealousy, and love, all with an air of righteous self-importance. Unfortunately, it manages none of these objectives with any degree of success. Starting with the main cast, the performances are shockingly low-energy and unconvincing. Charlie Negative's portrayal of Carl seems challenging at every turn; it's almost as if he's in a constant battle against his own instinct to bring any meaningful depth to the character. Amelia Overhype comes across as equally frustrating, offering a wooden depiction of the supposed femme fatale Sophia. Her on-screen interactions with Carl lack chemistry, ultimately tainting their relationship and the narrative's central romantic arc. Lastly, Max Misstep lives up to his namesake in his poor attempt at embodying the antagonistic Marcus, who is as forgettable as they come. To add insult to injury, the script, penned by first-time screenwriter Wordy Flatline, is a lamentable tire fire of insipid dialogue and predictable, spoon-fed plot. In an effort to appear cerebral and profound, the film deals with existential concepts, touching on the meaning of art, love, and the human condition, but ultimately, it only flounders in a verbose swamp of cliches and trite observations. The few potential redeeming qualities of Floundering Heights are overshadowed by the convoluted editing. Scenes tend to be stitched together with a blatant disregard for pacing, allowing the most inconsequential moments to drag on mercilessly while accelerating through potentially poignant ones. The erratic and choppy transitions make it difficult for the audience to build any meaningful connection to the characters or the unfolding plotlines. In terms of visual language, Sinkhole and cinematographer Grey Lackluster seem to have made a conscious decision to prioritize style over substance. Despite some striking compositions and lavish sets, the choices feel entirely divorced from the narrative, only serving as self-indulgent eye candy that distracts from the film's weak foundations. The choice of an overbearing and pretentious soundtrack further undermines the emotional authenticity of the film. In conclusion, Floundering Heights is a master class in cinematic missteps and missed opportunities. A thinly veiled exercise in pomp and vanity, it ultimately squanders the potential of its talented cast and creative team, delivering an empty, hallow shell of a story that feels twice as long as its two-hour runtime. At best, it provides a cautionary tale for future filmmakers who would seek to course-correct before venturing too far into the treacherous seas of artistic pretense."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who killed the Bedouin guide for drinking from a well without permission?

Options: [-] environment; [-] bosses; [-] transportation; [-] vegetation; [-] plants; [-] Energy.; [-] partners; [-] energy;","output":"Given the two facts provided: Fact 1: Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates. Fact 2: Mating Ducks usually look for a mate or partner in winter. It becomes evident that, in addition to territory, water, and food, animals can also compete for mates or partners. In the context of these facts, the term \\"mates\\" or \\"partners\\" refers to other individual animals with whom they can form a breeding relationship. This competition can be due to several factors such as the scarcity of potential mates, the need to ensure the propagation of one's genes, or the establishment of a social hierarchy. In the case of ducks, they look for a mate or partner usually during the winter season. This implies that this period is particularly crucial for them when it comes to mate selection, and with it comes competition. Ducks, like many other animals, have evolved various tactics to ensure they have the highest chance of securing a mate. Some may showcase elaborate mating rituals or displays, while others may employ a more aggressive approach to ward off rival males. This competition among animals extends beyond just ducks and can be seen in various species throughout the animal kingdom. For instance: 1. Deer - Male deer, also known as stags or bucks, will engage in fierce combat during the rutting season to establish dominance and secure rights to mate with females. 2. Birds - Many bird species exhibit intricate displays or sing complex songs in an attempt to attract a mate. In some cases, highly decorated or colorful plumages are developed through natural selection to enhance their chances of finding a mate. 3. Sea Turtles - Male sea turtles will compete for access to females by biting, ramming, or using other aggressive behaviors to ward off competitors. 4. Lions - Male lions fight for dominance over a pride, and the victor gains access to mate with the pride's females. This ensures only the strongest genes are passed on to the next generation. In conclusion, given the two facts provided, animals can compete for territory, water, food, or partners (mates). This competition is essential for survival, propagation of genes, and maintaining or asserting dominance within their respective social structures."},{"instruction":"Fact: cutting down trees has a negative impact on an organisms living in an ecosystem Question: Cutting down trees has a negative impact on what living in an ecosystem?

Doing the middle of the routine, half of the girls sit in the back behind the rest of the cheerleaders as they do a part of the routine. the routine","output":"It is important to remember that as an AI, I cannot predict any future events in real-time, but I can provide a well-formed suggestion based on the given information. Considering that we are discussing a cheerleading routine, I will proceed with outlining a probable next event for this routine. Based on the description provided, during the middle of the cheerleading routine, half of the girls are sitting in the back behind the rest of the cheerleaders. This setup seems like an ideal position for the next event, which could involve two primary elements: synchronization and transition. 1. Synchronization: A key aspect of cheerleading routines is the precision and synchronization of movements. The following sequence could enhance these aspects: a. The girls sitting in the back could perform a coordinated series of arm movements or claps, providing a strong visual and auditory impact. This could involve creating different shapes or patterns with their arms, combined with synchronized clapping or stomping. b. Simultaneously, the girls standing in the front could execute a complementary set of movements involving jumps, kicks, or turns. Integrating these movements with the synchronized elements from the girls sitting in the back would create a captivating scene for the audience. 2. Transition: To maintain the flow of the routine and create a seamless transition to the next event, the following actions could occur: a. The girls sitting in the back could swiftly stand up and join the rest of the cheerleaders in the front to form a new formation or a more comprehensive formation. b. As the girls in the back transition into the formation, the front row cheerleaders could perform a lift or stunt, such as a basket toss or an extension, to add a sense of dynamism and energy to the routine. c. When all cheerleaders have merged into the new formation, they could strike a powerful final pose or perform a group jump, making this transition visually striking and creating a memorable moment in the routine. To summarize, the most logical next event in this cheerleading routine could involve the synchronization of movements with the girls in the back providing a strong visual and auditory impact, while the girls in the front perform a series of jumps, kicks, or turns. This would then be followed by a smooth transition where the girls in the back swiftly stand up and join the rest of the cheerleaders to perform a lift or stunt, culminating in a powerful group pose or jump. The combination of these elements would not only display the cheerleaders' athletic prowess but also create a visually engaging and memorable performance for the audience."},{"instruction":"the risk, therefore, seems to be reduced by more than 80%.

Arnett worked for National Geographic magazine, and later for various television networks, most notably CNN. He is known for his coverage of the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. He was awarded the 1966 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for his work in Vietnam from 1962 to 1975, mostly reporting for the Associated Press. Arnett worked for CNN for 18 years ending in 1999. During the Gulf War, he became a household name worldwide when he became the only reporter with live coverage directly from Baghdad. His dramatic reports often had air raid sirens blaring and the sound of US bombs exploding in the background. Together with two other CNN journalists, Bernard Shaw and John Holliman, Arnett brought continuous coverage from Baghdad for the 16 initial intense hours of the war (17 January 1991). Although 40 foreign journalists were present at the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad at the time, only CNN possessed the means -- a private phone line connected to neighboring Amman, Jordan -- to communicate to the outside world. CNN broadcast Arnett's extended call live for several hours, with a picture of Arnett as video. Soon the other journalists left Iraq, including the two CNN colleagues, which left Arnett as the sole remaining reporter. His accounts of civilian damage caused by the bombing were not well received by the coalition war administration, who by their constant use of terms like \\"smart bombs\\" and \\"surgical precision\\" in their public statements, had tried to project an image that civilian casualties would be at a minimum. White House sources would later state that Arnett was being used as a tool for Iraqi disinformation, and CNN received a letter from 34 members of the United States Congress accusing Arnett of \\"unpatriotic journalism\\". Two weeks into the war, Arnett was able to obtain an exclusive, uncensored interview with Saddam Hussein. The Gulf War became the first war to be seen truly live on TV, due to Arnett's reporting from the \\"other side\\", for a period of five weeks. About halfway through the war the CIA approached Mr. Arnett. They believed that the Iraqi military was operating a high-level communication network from the basement of the Al Rashid Hotel, which is where Mr. Arnett and a few others from CNN were staying. The CIA wanted him out so the Air Force could bomb the hotel, but Mr. Arnett refused. He said he had been given a tour of the hotel and denied there was such a facility. what else happened during this time?","output":"During the time of the Gulf War, several other significant events and developments occurred: 1. The formation and actions of the coalition: The United States led a coalition of 34 nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, in a military operation to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The coalition represented an unprecedented level of international cooperation in response to Iraq's aggression. 2. Operation Desert Storm: On January 17, 1991, the aerial and naval bombardment phase of the war began, which sought to weaken Iraq's military infrastructure. The main offensive, known as Operation Desert Storm, included extensive bombing of strategic sites in Iraq and Kuwait. 3. Deployment of advanced military technology: The Gulf War was known for the use of advanced military technology, such as stealth aircraft, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and smart bombs. These technologies increased the accuracy and effectiveness of the coalition's attacks, while also reducing the potential for collateral damage. 4. The ground offensive: After weeks of air and missile attacks, coalition forces launched a ground offensive on February 24, 1991. Within 100 hours, they succeeded in liberating Kuwait from Iraqi forces. 5. The end of the war: On February 28, 1991, President George H.W. Bush declared the suspension of offensive combat operations, and a ceasefire was established on March 3. The United Nations passed various resolutions to ensure Iraq's compliance with disarmament and the removal of weapons of mass destruction. 6. Humanitarian crisis and aftermath: The war resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis, with thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians killed, millions displaced, and severe damage to infrastructure. Additionally, the war led to the imposition of economic sanctions on Iraq that lasted for more than a decade and contributed to the worsening of humanitarian conditions in the country. 7. Renewed Kurdish and Shi'a uprisings in Iraq: Inspired by the weakened state of Iraq's military after the Gulf War, both Kurdish and Shi'a groups rose up against Saddam Hussein's regime in an attempt to gain autonomy and political rights. However, the rebellions were brutally suppressed by the Iraqi government.

First, we're going to take care of this subtraction business, okay? 1. From 221396 subtract 9302. If you do that, you get 212094. 2. Then, from 2488*m subtract 49146. Now it looks like this: 212094 = 2488*m - 49146. Now we need to get rid of that pesky -49146 from the right side. Remember, when we want to change sides with numbers, they change their signs (like a game of tag)! So, we'll add 49146 to both sides. 1. 212094 + 49146 = 261240. 2. 2488*m - 49146 + 49146 becomes 2488*m. So, our equation looks like this now: 261240 = 2488*m. Okay, so far so good? Excellent! Now we're almost at the end. We have to find out what 'm' is. To do that, we just need to split the number on the left (261240) into equal little pieces that are the size of 2488 (since it's multiplied by 'm'). Imagine you have a big cake (261240) and you want to share it equally among your friends (this is the 'm' value). Each friend gets a piece that is the size of 2488. So we'll divide 261240 by 2488 to find out how many friends we can share our big cake with. When you do that, you get 'm' about equal to 105. So, m = 105. That's our answer! Remember, this is all just like sharing treats or trading stickers with your friends, but using bigger numbers!"},{"instruction":"Context: jan's children did not know how to speak so jan put their thoughts into words. Question: Why did Jan do this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: be a bad mother B: make communication easier C: spend time with her kids The answer to this question is:","output":"B: make communication easier. The context provided states that Jan's children did not know how to speak, so Jan put their thoughts into words. This inferences that Jan interpolated for her children because they were incapable of doing so due to their inability to speak yet. This action, therefore, seems to be motivated by an attempt to simplify communication or make it achievable among the children and others. They might not express what they want, need, or feel, so by interpreting their thoughts and contextualizing them into words, Jan makes it easier for them to communicate with others. This act does not directly imply being a bad mother (Option A), as the act of helping her children express themselves can be seen as nurturing and supportive, not destructive or detrimental. It's also crucial to realize that being a bad or good mother cannot be determined by a single act but rather an accumulation of actions over time. The act itself doesn't necessarily mean she is doing it to spend time with her kids (Option C). While it may contribute to spending more time with them, the primary aim here, according to the available context, is to facilitate their communication, not explicitly for bonding purposes. Therefore, according to the provided context, the statement 'make communication easier' makes the most sense as to why Jan was putting her children's thoughts into words. To ensure an effective flow of expression and understanding, she stepped in to bridge the gap their inability to speech created."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 1885 = 71*a + 74*a for a.","output":"Alright, let's solve it together step by step! We have the math problem: 1885 = 71 * a + 74 * a. First, let's add the two parts with 'a' together. 71 * a and 74 * a both have 'a' in them, so we can combine them like this: (71 + 74) * a. Now, 71 + 74 equals 145. So our problem now looks like this: 1885 = 145 * a. Next, we need to find out how many times 145 can fit into 1885. In other words, we will divide 1885 by 145. 1885 ÷ 145 = 13.

The formula is: h = (q + [(13(m+1))/5] + K + [(K/4)] + [(J/4)] - 2J) mod 7 where: - h is the day of the week (0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ...) - q is the day of the month - m is the month (3=March, 4=April, 5=May, ... 14=February) - K is the year of the century (year % 100) - J is the zero-based century (actually ⌊ year/100 ⌋) To apply the formula to April 29, 2011, first we need to adjust the month and year for January and February (counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year): The given date is April 29, 2011, so: - q = 29 (day of the month) - m = 4 (month of the year) - year = 2011 Next, find the values of K and J: - K = year % 100 = 2011 % 100 = 11 - J = ⌊year/100⌋ = ⌊2011/100⌋ = 20 Now, plug the values into the Zeller's Congruence formula: h = (29 + [(13(4+1))/5] + 11 + [11/4] + [20/4] - 2 * 20) mod 7 Calculating the terms in the formula: 1. [(13(4+1))/5] = [(13*5)/5] = 13 2. [11/4] = 2 (integer division) 3. [20/4] = 5 (integer division) Now substitute the calculated values back into the formula and simplify: h = (29 + 13 + 11 + 2 + 5 - 40) mod 7 h = 20 mod 7 h = 6 With h = 6, this corresponds to a Friday (0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4= Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday).

Possible A: barn, office, assembly line, museum, kitchen Why is \\"office\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Office\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because a copy machine, also known as a photocopier, is a piece of equipment predominantly found in office settings and frequently utilized for various purposes, such as printing, scanning, and copying documents. Offices usually employ copy machines because they serve a fundamental role in daily administrative tasks, record keeping, and communication. In contrast, the other suggested places – barn, assembly line, museum, and kitchen – are not typically associated with the presence or usage of copy machines. Here's why: 1. Barn: A barn is a large farm building designed to shelter animals, store agriculture equipment, and house agricultural products like hay, grain, and crops. It is unlikely to find a copy machine in a barn since the primary activities conducted there are related to farming, animal care, and storage rather than paperwork or record keeping. 2. Assembly line: An assembly line is a manufacturing process in which a product is assembled in a sequential order, with each station adding a specific component or performing an operation on the product. These environments are focused on the production of goods, and copy machines are not relevant to this purpose. Consequently, it is uncommon to find a copy machine on an assembly line. 3. Museum: Museums are institutions dedicated to conserving, exhibiting, and educating the public about historical, cultural, artistic, or scientific artifacts. While it is possible for copy machines to be present in office areas within a museum designated for administrative tasks, visitor service, or other such purposes, the core areas of museums, like exhibition halls or galleries, do not typically contain copy machines. 4. Kitchen: A kitchen is a room or area primarily used for cooking, food preparation, and storage of cooking utensils. Kitchens generally do not require a copy machine because the focus is on culinary activities, and the presence of a copy machine might not only be impractical but could also create potential safety hazards or sanitation issues. In conclusion, \\"office\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to the functional requirements and common usage of a copy machine in an office environment. Offices are the central hubs for administration, documentation, and communication, making them the most logical and practical location for a copy machine. The other options are less likely places to find a copy machine because they cater to different purposes and activities, which do not typically involve the need for a copy machine."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the subject line \\"Bonneville Power Administration\\".","output":"Step 1: Determine the purpose of the email In order to write an appropriate email, I need to understand why the user wants to write an email with the subject line \\"Bonneville Power Administration.\\" It could be a discussion of a job opportunity, sharing information about the company, or discussing service updates.

Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing.\\" Answer:","output":"The publication of Lexicon Technicum happened later than its drafting. John Harris, an English mathematician and scientist, drafted the Lexicon Technicum to create a comprehensive technical dictionary focusing on science and technology. This ambitious project aimed to cover various subjects in mathematics, commercial arithmetic, physical sciences, and navigation in a methodical manner. The drafting process was a significant endeavor, as it involved researching, organizing and compiling a vast amount of information related to the various technical subjects covered in the work. Harris' intention was to avoid diving into theological and biographical entries, emphasizing a more systematic approach to the description and explanation of the subjects within the book. After the extensive drafting stage, the Lexicon Technicum was finally published in 1704. Its publication marked an essential milestone by providing the first book in English that systematically dealt with technical subjects. This work not only served as a source of knowledge for its readers but also laid the foundation for future technical dictionaries and encyclopedias. Following Harris' innovative model, other technical dictionaries were published, such as Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1728. The Cyclopaedia further expanded on Harris' work, encompassing five editions with a more substantial scope, even including foldout engravings in its folio edition. This notable work focused on delivering in-depth information about Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and various technologies like engraving, brewing, and dyeing, among others. In summary, the drafting of the Lexicon Technicum predates its publication, which happened in 1704. The drafting process involved meticulous research and organization to create this pioneering work. The publication of Lexicon Technicum led to the development of other technical dictionaries, setting an important precedent for the evolution of scientific and technical literature."},{"instruction":"His anger reached a boiling point, the therapist said they should take a break and what?

The United States in November may elect a president who promises to abandon many norms of governance, and a horrendous terrorist attack has opened up new talk in the presidential race of upending the nation’s longstanding economic and diplomatic relationships with the rest of the world. Oh, and last month the United States experienced its weakest job growth in six years. If there was a good time for financial markets to show signs of fear for global economic and political stability, this would seem to be it. In the last several days there has been some evidence, if you look carefully enough, of the risk that some big, disruptive events will become priced into markets. The British pound has fallen steeply on currency markets, reflecting the risk of “Brexit,” and government bond prices in advanced nations have soared (and their yields have fallen) as investors have plowed money into safe assets. But many other financial market conditions are more consistent with what you expect to see when everything is basically going fine — not indicative of a major risk of financial, economic or geopolitical upheaval. The American stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, is hovering just below record highs. A measure of expected market volatility, the Vix, has spiked in the last few days but remains well below its level of just a few months ago. Oil prices have been rising steadily since February and haven’t moved much in the last week, let alone shown the drop you might expect if a collapse in global demand seemed imminent. There are two possibilities of what is going on. At best, the markets are telling us something important that excitable journalists and pundits aren’t. Call this the markets-are-smart theory. At worst, markets are complacent, and deep-seated flaws in how financial markets work mean that current stock and commodity prices aren’t reflecting the major risks that lie ahead. The “markets are really efficient” story goes like this: Britain, when all is said and done, will probably vote to remain part of Europe (as betting markets suggest). Donald Trump probably won’t be elected president (as polling suggests). The American economy will probably keep doing O.K. despite the weak May jobs numbers. And even if any of those forecasts turns out to be wrong, the consequences for the economy and corporate profits won’t be as severe as fearful headlines suggest. The British economy will remain basically sound as the nation renegotiates its trade relationships; Mr. Trump will govern more like a conventional president than his words now suggest; and any economic slump in the United States will be short and mild. In this story, stock, bond and currency traders have the wisdom to look past the noise that the aforementioned excitable journalists and pundits don’t. The other argument is scarier. Markets are very good at incorporating news into asset prices when it’s clear and straightforward how one should affect the other. When a company releases an earnings report, analysts can quickly figure out what it should mean for the stock price, and the stock moves accordingly. When data comes out that makes a Federal Reserve rate increase 10 percent more likely, it’s fairly straightforward to translate that into the proper pricing of Treasury bonds and the dollar. A disruption to an oil pipeline has a relatively clear-cut impact on the price of crude. So traders are efficient at pricing in pieces of news that affect asset prices in predictable ways over the short and medium term. They’re a lot worse at predicting which major threats to the global economy will spiral out of control and which will turn out to hardly matter. Consider two examples from recent years. In the summer and fall of 2011, investors were panicked that the eurozone would unravel because of the fiscal crisis that started in Greece. Global stock markets, commodities and risky forms of debt plummeted; volatility skyrocketed. But things turned out to be more or less fine. More aggressive action by the European Central Bank and European political leaders starting late that year helped calm everyone. And while the European economy is not in great shape, the Continent experienced no epic financial crisis. If you had the nerve to buy eurozone stocks in September 2011, you have enjoyed a 51 percent return on your money. Other times, instead of being too fearful of cataclysmic events, financial markets are too complacent. What we now call the global financial crisis got its start in mid-2007, as losses on mortgage-related securities mounted and global money markets froze up. But after some initial efforts by the Federal Reserve and other government officials to contain the damage, financial markets rallied 11 percent from mid-August through mid-October, pushing the stock market to new highs and suggesting all was well. Of course, as it turned out, a severe recession and catastrophic financial crisis were just around the corner. People who bought into any risky assets, whether stocks or mortgage-backed securities, at the October highs lost their shirts. Some smart people, like strategists at Goldman Sachs, are advancing the possibility that markets could be in a similarly precarious state right now. It may even be that the normal mechanisms through which those fears would translate into lower stock prices and higher volatility indexes are broken right now; many “macro” hedge funds that bet on big seismic changes in the global economy have been losing money for the last few years, and some have closed. Even if that’s so, the next few months will be a great test of just how much markets really know about the future. And given the precarious headlines of the last few months, anyone who wants to make sure they don’t lose their shirts again should hope that they’ve got it right.

What's the opposite of adding 9770? Correct! The opposite is subtracting 9770. So we're going to subtract 9770 from both sides of the equation. When we do that, we have: -9770 = -977*j Now, to get j by itself, we need to divide both sides by -977. Can you tell me what happens when we divide -9770 by -977? Great job!

While San Diego has several sports teams in different leagues, it is important to narrow down the scope of the question. Therefore, the championship in question needs to be identified first. In this article, we will dive deep into the victories of San Diego’s sports landscape and try to find out the specific team and match where San Diego's victory margin is being sought. San Diego and Sports San Diego, California, has a passionate sports culture that ranges from high school to professional level. The city has been a host to major sports teams in various sports, such as football, basketball, soccer, and baseball. Some of the renowned teams from San Diego include the San Diego Padres (Major League Baseball), San Diego Loyal SC (United Soccer League), and San Diego Gulls (American Hockey League). In the past, the city was home to the San Diego Chargers (National Football League) before their relocation to Los Angeles in 2017. Defining the Championship To uncover the exact victory margin, we ought to first ascertain which league, and subsequently which team, falls within the scope of the question. The main events to consider include: 1. San Diego Padres (MLB) - With roots going back to 1969, this baseball team is currently the only major league professional sports team in the city. 2. San Diego Loyal SC (USL) - A fairly recent addition to the city's sports scene, the Loyal SC soccer club was founded in 2019, with their first season in 2020. 3. San Diego Gulls (AHL) - This professional ice hockey team was founded in 2015 and competes in the American Hockey League. 4. San Diego Chargers (NFL) - Although no longer in San Diego, the Chargers' long 56-year presence in the city and the victories they achieved must also be considered. Finding the San Diego Victory Margin With various championships in different sports, homing in on a single victory margin presents a challenge. Therefore, we will need to explore multiple scenarios to provide a comprehensive answer. 1. San Diego Padres - Victories by the Padres have varied throughout their history. Depending on the particular game, these margins can be a few runs to an impressive, double-digit win. 2. San Diego Loyal SC - In their short history, the Loyal SC has demonstrated their ability to win by a single goal or more. Although yet to be crowned a USL championship, they have showcased their potential. 3. San Diego Gulls - Victory margins in the AHL typically range from one to several goals, and the Gulls are no exception. Their wins have significantly contributed to the city's sports scene. 4. San Diego Chargers - Throughout their stay in San Diego, the Chargers recorded wins starting from a single-point lead to a significant point difference. As the competition was fierce, NFL games are often won with just a field goal's lead or more. Conclusion Given the multidimensional nature of San Diego's sports universe, it is not feasible to provide a definitive answer to the question posed without specifying the team and match in question. Nevertheless, San Diego has been a hub for an array of victorious occasions in sports, testifying to the triumph and talent ingrained in every match. Therefore, to obtain accurate information about a particular championship or game, it is essential to specify the team, season, and opposition, allowing us to provide a precise victory margin for the match in question."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. Question: What is the purpose of the author in writing this passage? Options: A: To teach people how to be a blood donor B: To give people the knowledge of blood donation C: To advise people to benefit from blood donation D: To remind people of the importance of blood donation The answer is:","output":"B: To give people the knowledge of blood donation"},{"instruction":"Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Possible answers: -- negative. -- positive.

Standing on the River Thames in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London,[note 1] a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2] The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London.

The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle.

Carole King and Gerry Goffin were among the most influential and successful songwriting teams in popular music history, crafting numerous hits throughout the 1960s, particularly in the realm of Brill Building pop.

It seems that the reviewer acknowledges the potential value of the product, stating that their grandchildren have piano playing role models and that their mother plans to use the book to help them learn when they are ready. However, the negative aspect comes from the issue mentioned regarding their grandchildren's attention span being too short to actually utilize and learn from the material provided in the book at the moment. The fact that the reviewer points out their grandchildren's age, 4 and 6 years old, implies that they might not be the appropriate audience or target group for this product, and they may not be at the right stage to take full advantage of the material. This observation hints at the possibility of the product not catering well to the younger age group or, at the very least, not addressing the specific needs of children with shorter attention spans. Furthermore, the title communicates a negative message by indicating that the product requires more prolonged attention than what their grandchildren can offer, suggesting that it might not be the most engaging or suited for children of that age group. In summary, while there are some positive aspects mentioned in the review regarding the mother's support and commitment to use the book with her children later on, the overall tone leans towards neutral to slightly negative.

When choosing bagged lettuce, the flattest bag is generally the best choice because it means that the produce has not released gases like ethylene and carbon dioxide, which are produced as the vegetables age. Puffier bags indicate that some gases have been released inside the bag due to the aging of the lettuce. Choosing the puffiest bag (ii) would not accomplish the goal of buying the freshest lettuce, as the presence of gas in the bag indicates that the lettuce has been aging and is no longer as fresh as it could be."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Aleksander Barkov Jr was born in 1995.

You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Q: The plot concerns the activities of a group of church musicians, the Mellstock parish choir, one of whom, Dick Dewy, becomes romantically entangled with a comely new school mistress, Fancy Day. The novel opens with the fiddlers and singers of the choir including Dick, his father Reuben Dewy, and grandfather William Dewy making the rounds in Mellstock village on Christmas Eve. When the little band plays at the schoolhouse, young Dick falls for Fancy at first sight. Dick, smitten, seeks to insinuate himself into her life and affections, but Fancy's beauty has gained her other suitors, including a rich farmer and the new vicar at the parish church. The vicar, Mr. Maybold, informs the choir that he intends Fancy, an accomplished organ player, to replace their traditional musical accompaniment to Sunday services. The tranter and the rest of the band visit the vicar's home to negotiate, but reluctantly give way to the more modern organ. Meanwhile, Dick seems to win Fancy's heart, and she discovers an effective strategem to overcome her father's objection to the potential marriage. After the two are engaged secretly, however, vicar Maybold impetuously asks Fancy to marry him and lead a life of relative affluence; racked by guilt and temptation, she accepts. The next day, however, at a chance meeting with the as-yet-unaware Dick, surprised Maybold learns from him of his engagement to Fancy. The vicar follows by prompting her by letter, while expressing being taken aback by such news, to be honest to Dewy and withdraw her commitment to him if she indeed intended to become married to Maybold. Fancy responds by withdrawing her consent to marry Maybold and asking him to keep her initial acceptance of his proposal forever a secret. Maybold replies by urging her again to be honest with Dick and admit she accepted the vicar despite having already committed herself to the young tranter, assuring her she would be forgiven. However, as she marries Dewy who is so in love he readily dismisses what he previously (rightly) considered exhibits of her fickleness and rejoices at what he perceives at the prospect of a happy union based on honesty, given Fancy's effusive and seemingly frank admission to some (minor) infidelities, while he assumes they would never keep any secrets from each other, she resolves never to disclose the truly incontrovertible and damning evidence against her character in her having so readily accepted Maybold despite her engagement to Dewy. The novel ends with a humorous portrait of Reuben, William, Mr. Day, and the rest of the Mellstock rustics as they celebrate the couple's wedding day. The mood is joyful, but at the end of the final chapter, the reader is reminded that Fancy has married with \\"a secret she would never tell\\" (her final flirtation and brief engagement to the vicar). While Under the Greenwood Tree is often seen as Hardy's gentlest and most pastoral novel, this final touch introduces a faint note of melancholy to the conclusion.

Since then, U.S. dollar banknotes have only been issued in seven denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. What's the best answer to this question: does the u.s. have a 500 bill?","output":"The best answer to the question, \\"Does the U.S. have a 500 bill?\\" would be: No, the United States does not currently have a 500 bill in circulation. While 500 bills were once issued by the United States Treasury, they were last printed in 1945 and officially discontinued by the Federal Reserve in 1969. As of now, the highest denomination of currency circulated in the U.S. is the 100 bill. However, it is worth noting some historical context surrounding the 500 bill. The 500 bill, featuring a portrait of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. President, was part of a series of large denominations of U.S. currency. These included the 1,000 bill, which featured Grover Cleveland, the 5,000 bill with James Madison, the 10,000 bill depicting Salmon P. Chase, and the extremely rare 100,000 bill showcasing Woodrow Wilson. These large denominations were mostly used for transactions between banks and not meant for public circulation. The primary reason behind the discontinuation of these high-denomination bills was due to advancements in banking technology and the growing preference for checks and electronic payments. Additionally, concerns about money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal activities related to large cash transactions played a role in the decision, as these high-denomination notes made it easier for illegal transactions to occur without detection. While you will not find a 500 bill in regular usage today, they still remain legal tender and can be exchanged at financial institutions. However, since they are now considered collectors' items, they often have a value higher than their face value, depending on their condition and rarity. In conclusion, while the U.S. once had a 500 bill in circulation, it is no longer in use. The current U.S. currency denominations are limited to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 bills, catering to the modern preferences for checks and electronic payment methods."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go.

Article: Everyone has good days and bad days. Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all.

Movie title: Dawn of the world Movie plot: The Mesopotamian Marshes, at the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, in the south of Iraq. This is where Mastour and Zahra grow up. Shortly after their marriage, Mastour and Zahra are forced to separate when the Gulf War breaks out. On the battlefield, Mastour befriends Riad, a young soldier from Baghdad. Mortally wounded, Mastour makes Riad promise to protect Zahra when the war is over. When Riad arrives in the village, he falls deeply in love with Zahra. But unable to bear the loss of her husband, Zahra shuts herself off. In this completely foreign environment that is hostile to this newcomer, and as a new conflict is on the verge of inflaming the whole area, Riad will do the impossible to find his place. Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Dawn of the World,\\" Mastour and Zahra are forced to separate due to the outbreak of the Gulf War. The Gulf War, which started in 1990, was a conflict between Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, and a coalition of 35 nations led by the United States in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This war had a significant impact on many aspects of life in the region, including the lives of ordinary people like Mastour and Zahra. Being newly married, Mastour and Zahra's separation is a heartbreaking event in their lives. Furthermore, the separation isn't voluntary, as Mastour is likely drafted or pressured into joining the military to fight the war. As a result, Zahra is left behind in the village, waiting for her husband's return and fearing for his safety. Mastour's experiences on the battlefield introduce him to Riad, a young soldier from Baghdad. As the war progresses, the two form a bond of friendship that is tested when Mastour is mortally wounded in combat. Before succumbing to his injuries, Mastour makes Riad promise to protect Zahra once the war is over. Riad fulfills his promise and arrives in the village to look after Zahra, but finds himself falling deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, Zahra struggles to cope with the loss of her husband and isolates herself from her surroundings. The environment in the village becomes hostile towards Riad, with tensions arising from his outsider status and the brewing conflict threatening the stability of the area. In conclusion, the primary force that leads to Mastour and Zahra's separation is the outbreak of the Gulf War, which tore many families apart and drastically altered the lives of those residing in the affected areas. The movie explores themes of love, loss, loyalty, and the struggle to find one's place in a world that is continuously changing due to ongoing conflicts."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world. Question: Prior to New York, what city was the center of the world of art?","output":"Prior to New York City becoming the center of the world of art, Paris, France, held that prestigious title. For centuries, Paris had been the epicenter of the art world, with a rich history of nurturing artistic talent and creativity. This long-standing reputation solidified during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Paris witnessed a flourishing of art movements, schools, and influential artists. Throughout this period, Paris was home to numerous famous artists, such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas. The city provided a fertile environment for the development and exchange of artistic ideas, fostering groundbreaking movements like Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, and Surrealism, which would deeply influence the trajectory of art worldwide. Not only did Paris provide a nurturing cultural atmosphere for artists, but it also offered essential institutional support for the creation and display of art. Institutions like the École des Beaux-Arts, the Académie Julian, and the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs played critical roles in shaping the careers of artists from across the globe. Additionally, annual events, like the Paris Salon and later the Salon des Indépendants, helped showcase and legitimize groundbreaking works by contemporary artists. However, following the end of World War II, the dynamics of the global art scene began to shift. As the article states, the rising prominence and economic prosperity of New York City, along with the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, contributed to its displacement of Paris as the center of the art world. Influential New York artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko, and the rise of American art dealers and galleries played a significant role in reshaping the global artistic landscape. In conclusion, Paris, France, was considered the center of the world of art before New York City took on that role in the mid-20th century.

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Q: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

Complete the next sentence: How to bodyboard Put safety first. If you want to be able to body board, then you should already be a good swimmer. You'll need to use a lot of the techniques you use for swimming to propel your board, and furthermore, you'll need to be a good swimmer to swim without your board if you wipe out.","output":"To begin your bodyboarding journey, follow these steps: 1. Choose the right bodyboard: Select a bodyboard that is appropriate for your size and skill level. The ideal bodyboard should reach from your knees to your chin when stood on end. Make sure the material is durable, lightweight, and buoyant. Popular materials include polyethylene, polypropylene, and various combinations of core materials. Additionally, consider getting a leash to attach your board to your wrist or bicep. This will prevent your board from being washed away, making it easier to locate after a wipeout. 2. Wear appropriate gear: Invest in a good wetsuit, which will keep your body warm in cold water, protect your skin from abrasion and sunburn, and provide buoyancy for better flotation. Also, consider wearing swim fins to help you paddle and kick more effectively in the water. Make sure they fit comfortably and securely, as loose fins can be a hindrance in the water. 3. Learn to read ocean conditions: Study the ocean terrain and currents of your chosen surf spot. Familiarize yourself with riptides, sandbars, and other natural phenomena to ensure your safety. Get advice from experienced bodyboarders, lifeguards, and surf instructors about the best conditions for bodyboarding at your chosen location. 4. Paddling and catching waves: Start by lying flat on your bodyboard with your stomach aligned with the center of the board. Position yourself so that your legs are dangling off the board's tail. Use your arms to paddle out towards the waves, similar to how you would swim freestyle. Use your swim fins to kick and help propel yourself through the water. To catch a wave, position yourself near the peak of the wave and paddle as the wave approaches. Use your swim fins to kick harder as the wave approaches, and keep your head down and your body aligned with the board. Once you feel the wave's energy, propel yourself forward by arching your back and using your arms and legs to steer. 5. Riding the wave: As you catch the wave, maintain your balance by keeping your weight centered and your body as streamlined as possible. Shift your weight forward or backward on the board to change your speed, and use your arms and legs to turn and maneuver. Remember to always lean into the turns to maintain control of your bodyboard. 6. Practicing safety and etiquette: Like any water sport, bodyboarding has rules of etiquette and safety that should be followed. Always prioritize your own safety as well as that of fellow bodyboarders, swimmers, and surfers. Be aware of your surroundings and ensure that you do not interfere with others in the water. Familiarize yourself with the local etiquette, such as right of way on the waves and respecting the environment. 7. Improving your skills: Practice makes perfect. Spend time honing your bodyboarding skills, such as paddling, wave selection, wave riding, and turns. Take lessons from experienced riders to learn advanced moves. Experiment with new techniques and invest in better gear as you progress to enhance your overall experience. By following these steps, you will be well on your way to becoming a skilled and responsible bodyboarder. Remember to respect your limits and learn from experienced riders to maximize your safety and enjoyment as you explore the exciting world of bodyboarding."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: Two siblings were going to school.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process would likely involve monitoring and maintaining the dam's operations to ensure its continued efficiency and safety. This would entail the following actions: 1. Regular inspection and maintenance: The dam's structural integrity and its mechanical and electrical components must be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure that it can continue to operate safely and effectively. This would involve routine checks for cracks, leaks, and signs of erosion, as well as testing and servicing of the gates, pumps, and other equipment. Any issues that are identified must be addressed in a timely manner to minimize the risk of catastrophic failure. 2. Continuous monitoring of water levels: The water levels behind the dam and in the downstream river should be monitored continuously, either through manual measurements or automated sensors. This will enable the dam's operators to make informed decisions about when and how much to open the gates, taking into consideration the rainfall forecast, the dam's storage capacity, and the potential impact on downstream communities and ecosystems. 3. Adaptive management: The dam's operational procedures and strategies should be continuously reviewed and updated based on new data, insights, and lessons learned. This may involve adjusting the frequency and duration of gate openings, fine-tuning reservoir storage targets, or modifying the dam's design or capacity if it becomes clear that the original specifications are insufficient to cope with future flood risks and demands. 4. Emergency preparedness and response: The dam's operators should develop and implement comprehensive emergency response plans, including early warning systems and evacuation procedures for downstream communities and infrastructure in case of a dam failure or other crisis situation. These plans should be regularly reviewed, tested, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. 5. Coordination and collaboration with stakeholders: Finally, the dam's management should maintain open and transparent communication channels with local communities, government agencies, and other stakeholders who may be affected by or have an interest in the dam's operations. This can help to build trust, facilitate information sharing, and ensure that all parties are prepared and able to respond effectively to changing conditions and emerging risks."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more plants are planted happens, how will it affect more air moves into the lungs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process described in the question is not entirely accurate. The correct process of air in respiration is as follows: 1. Air is drawn in through the mouth or nose. 2. The air passes through the trachea. 3. The air moves into the bronchi, which are smaller branches of the trachea. 4. The air continues into the bronchioles, even smaller branches within the lungs. 5. The air finally reaches the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs: oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide is released from the bloodstream into the lungs. 6. The carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled from the lungs, back through the bronchioles, bronchi, trachea, and finally out through the mouth or nose. Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, if more plants are planted, the overall oxygen concentration in the atmosphere may increase as plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and release oxygen (O2) through photosynthesis. This increase in oxygen concentration could potentially affect respiratory processes, even if the impact is relatively indirect. An increased availability of oxygen in the atmosphere could lead to potentially easier or more efficient gas exchange in the alveoli, as there might be a higher concentration of oxygen to be absorbed. However, it is essential to note that while an increase in overall oxygen concentration in the atmosphere may occur, the actual differences experienced by an individual's lungs might be negligible due to the already abundant presence of oxygen in the air (approximately 21% O2). Additionally, as plants also absorb pollutants and improve air quality, the presence of more plants might result in fewer contaminants entering the respiratory system, leading to better lung health in the long term. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more plants may have a slightly positive, indirect effect on the respiratory process by potentially increasing the already abundant oxygen concentration and improving air quality. However, with oxygen concentration already high in the atmosphere, the actual impact on respiratory efficiency at the individual level may not be substantial."},{"instruction":"Article: Go to https://smallpdf.com/protect-pdf/ in your web browser.

Is the following statement true? \\"The Illuminati's responsible for world war II final outcome.\\"","output":"To address the statement \\"The Illuminati's responsible for World War II final outcome.\\", let's analyze the claim step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the context - World War II was a major conflict involving many countries from 1939 to 1945, marked by significant events like the Holocaust and the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war eventually resulted in the defeat of the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the victory of the Allied powers (including the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France). Step 2: Define the subject - The Illuminati refers to an alleged secret society that is often associated with conspiracy theories surrounding world domination and the manipulation of world events. Step 3: Analyze historical evidence - To assert that the Illuminati was responsible for the outcome of World War II, one would need to provide concrete historical evidence linking the secret society to key events, decisions, and leaders involved in the war. However, no such credible evidence exists. The outcome of the war is instead attributed to a combination of geopolitical, economic, ideological, and military factors. Step 4: Evaluate plausibility - Given the lack of evidence supporting the involvement of the Illuminati in World War II, and considering that international political events are typically driven by complex interacting forces, the claim that the Illuminati is responsible for the war's outcome appears implausible. In conclusion, based on the available evidence and our analysis, the statement \\"The Illuminati's responsible for World War II final outcome\\" is not true. The outcome of the war can be attributed to a multitude of factors involving national governments, military strategies, and global alliances, rather than a secretive group like the Illuminati."},{"instruction":"No. Make it louder!

Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged--lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, bassist Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Riedel, drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, lead vocalist Till Lindemann, rhythm guitarist Paul H. Landers, and keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz. The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Context: In September 2014, band co-founder Richard Z. Kruspe (who is working with his side band, Emigrate) said the band was preparing some more live DVDs and that they were taking some time off from the studio. The band will meet again in 2015 to decide if the time is right to return to the studio. In May 2015, Lindemann confirmed in an interview with MusikUniverse that Rammstein will start pre-production on a possible new album in September, and that production will most likely go on until 2017. According to Peter Tagtgren - who works with frontman Till Lindemann on their side-project Lindemann - Till will be regrouping with his Rammstein bandmates later in 2015 to start pre-production on a new full-length album, which normally takes two years to be released. In early August 2015, Rammstein released a trailer for an upcoming project, titled \\"In Amerika\\". On August 15, the band announced Rammstein in Amerika, a video release that includes a 2010 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City and a documentary made from archived footage recorded during the band's career. Rammstein played several festivals in Europe and North America during 2016, and in November announced plans to perform at a similar string of European festivals in 2017. On 18 January 2017 Rammstein announced a new live video release titled Paris, a recording of a March 2012 concert that took place at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris. It premiered on 23 March in selected cinemas, and it was released worldwide on DVD/Blu-Ray and CD on 19 May 2017. In an interview in March 2017, Richard Kruspe said that Rammstein had about 35 new songs that were close to complete, though the release date of the band's seventh studio album was an open question. In May, Rammstein started touring once again. Also in May, music producer Sky Van Hoff was announced to be Rammstein's newest producer. In a July interview with Resurrection Fest, Kruspe said that the album could be the band's last. Question: Was there another video release?.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If more coal is burned, this will result in higher amounts of sulfur in the coal combining with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. The increase in sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere will subsequently lead to increased production of sulfur trioxide when the sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere. As a result, more sulfur trioxide will react with water in the atmosphere to produce larger quantities of sulfuric acid, making rain more acidic. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed, specifically the burning of more coal, would not lead to less sulfuric acid being formed. Instead, it would have a direct effect on the process by increasing the production of sulfuric acid, subsequently leading to more acidic rain."},{"instruction":"Edouard Louis Joseph, baron Merckx (Dutch pronunciation: ['merks]; born 17 June 1945), better known as Eddy Merckx, is a Belgian former professional road and track bicycle racer who is widely seen as the most successful rider in the history of competitive cycling. His victories include an unequalled eleven Grand Tours (five Tours of France, five Tours of Italy, and a Tour of Spain), all of the five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, every major one-day race other than Paris-Tours, and extensive victories on the track. Born in Meensel-Kiezegem, Brabant, Belgium, he grew up in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre where his parents ran a grocery store. He played several sports, but found his true passion in cycling. Merckx opened the 1967 campaign with two stage victories at the Giro di Sardegna. He followed these successes by entering Paris-Nice where he won the second stage and took the race lead. Two stages later, a teammate, Tom Simpson, attacked with several other riders on a climb and was nearly 20 minutes ahead of Merckx, who remained in a group behind. Merckx attacked two days later on a climb 70 km into the stage. He was able to establish a firm advantage, but obeyed orders from his manager to wait for the chasing Simpson. Merckx won the stage, while Simpson secured his overall victory. On 18 March, Merckx started the Milan-San Remo and was seen as a 120-1 favorite to win the race. He attacked on the Capo Berta and again on the Poggio, leaving only Gianni Motta with him. The two slowed their pace and were joined by two more riders. Merckx won the four-man sprint to the finish. His next victory came in La Fleche Wallonne after he missed out on an early break, caught up to it, and attacked from it to win the race. On 20 May, he started the Giro d'Italia, his first Grand Tour. He won the twelfth and fourteenth stages en route to finishing ninth in the general classification. He signed with Faema on 2 September for ten years worth 400,000 Belgian francs. He chose to switch over in order to be in complete control over the team he was racing for. In addition, he would not have to pay for various expenses that came with racing such as wheels and tires. The next day, Merckx started the men's road race at the 1967 UCI Road World Championships in Heerlen, Netherlands. The course consisted of ten laps of a circuit. Motta attacked on the first lap and was joined by Merckx and five other riders. The group thinned to five as they reached the finish line where Merckx was able to out-sprint Jan Janssen for first place. In doing so, he became the third rider to win the world road race amateur and professional titles. By winning the race he earned the right to wear the rainbow jersey as world champion. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have any other victories?","output":"Eddy Merckx had an impressive number of victories throughout his career. As mentioned in the original text, his wins include eleven Grand Tours, five Monuments, three World Championships, the hour record, and almost every major one-day race with the exception of Paris-Tours. Furthermore, he achieved numerous victories on the track. His incredible success has earned him the reputation of being the most successful cyclist in the history of competitive cycling, which clearly demonstrates the extent of his additional victories beyond the ones specifically discussed in the text."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: M: Oh, hi, Linda.

The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program. The organization is Los Angeles' largest government-funded group, with a budget of 11 million leveraged into 40 million in legal services to the poor.

He denies 13 charges of endangering aircraft between November 2013 and September 2014. The court heard Mr Jones had a grievance against the RAF and had, at one stage, considered legal action. Prosecutor John Philpotts when Mr Jones was interviewed, he alleged pilots were deliberately harassing him by flying over his property from RAF Valley. He said he only went outside to inspect his property with a torch and may have, on one occasion, instinctively shone it upwards as a jet passed by, but it was not deliberate. Mr Philpotts said an under cover police officer watched a man shine a torch at aircraft on one occasion and that was Mr Jones. Mr Jones lives close to a relief landing strip at RAF Mona, which has been used for more than 100 years. \\"It is the prosecution case that he became obsessed with the activity of the aircraft flying out,\\" Mr Philpotts said. \\"He became displeased by the aviation activity in the skies near his land.\\" On occasions, jets had to abandon landings, the jury was told.

The formation of new crust beneath the surface displaced ocean waters by as much as 200 m (656 ft) more than today, which flooded coastal areas.

A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. and the situation: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming.

Geographically speaking, the exact center of the United States is an area near Lebanon, Kansas. However, it is important to note that the geographical center varies depending on whether you are considering only the contiguous 48 states or including Alaska and Hawaii. With the inclusion of Alaska and Hawaii, the center shifts to a location near Belle Fourche, South Dakota. If the question is asking for a more significant city in close proximity to the geographical center of the contiguous United States, then the answer would likely be Kansas City.

Justification: Dead zones in water bodies are primarily caused by excessive nutrient pollution from human activities such as using large amounts of fertilizers. The nutrients from the fertilizers, notably nitrogen and phosphorus, leach into the lakes where they create excessive growth of algae, known as algae bloom. When this algae decomposes, it uses up the oxygen in the water, leading to zones where other aquatic life cannot survive due to lack of oxygen. These are known as dead zones. In the text, it is mentioned that Rick has started using large amounts of fertilizers, which increases the risk of nutrient pollution and hence the development of dead zones in nearby water bodies. On the other hand, Dale has reduced his fertilizer usage, which lowers the risk of such pollution, making lakes near Dale's farm less likely to develop dead zones, assuming all other conditions are the same.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the given process The process is describing the formation and impacts of acid rain due to human industrial activities that generate chemical compounds. These chemicals are released into air, mix with clouds, and fall back to earth as acidic rain, which can damage both natural and man-made objects. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that if there are fewer coal miners, there will be less pollution. Step 3: Analyze the potential impacts of the perturbation hypothesis If there are fewer coal miners, this could result in a decline in coal production and the usage of coal as a source of energy in industries. Coal combustion is known to produce pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of acid rain. Step 4: Evaluate the effect of the perturbation on the process With a decrease in coal production and combustion, there would be a reduction in chemical compounds released from coal-based industries. Consequently, fewer chemical compounds would rise into the air and mix with elements in clouds. This scenario would lead to a decrease in the formation of acid rain. Step 5: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer coal miners and coal production declines, it reduces pollution from coal combustion.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Bernard Chanticleer, called \\"Big Boy\\" by his parents, is 19 but still lives with his overbearing, clinging mother and his commanding, disapproving father, who is Curator of Incunabula at the New York Public Library. Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him. His father decides it's time he grew up and moved out of the family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment. His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing. Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity. Bernard's mother also constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence. The answer is:","output":"In the given context, Bernard Chanticleer is said to not like girls, or at least not be interested in them yet. This opinion is expressed by his mother, who seems to be quite overprotective and clinging. She is the one who reassures Miss Nora Thing that her son isn't interested in girls and even goes as far as to arrange for Miss Thing to keep an eye on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity. It's important to note that Bernard's lack of interest in girls may not be an accurate representation of his true feelings or preferences, but rather a perception enforced by his overbearing mother. The controlling environment in which he lives - with both his parents constantly monitoring and admonishing him - may have limited his opportunities to form his own opinions and explore relationships. As a result, it may be more accurate to say that Bernard's mother is the one who believes her son is not interested in girls, rather than definitively stating that Bernard himself does not like girls. The context provided suggests that Bernard's mother is trying to maintain control over her son's life, even as he moves out of the family home and attempts to forge his own path. Her insistence on keeping an eye on Bernard through Miss Thing, as well as sending him locks of her hair, highlights her reluctance to let him go and her desire to continue influencing his actions and decisions."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Step-by-step reasoning process: A baby is sitting by some blocks while reaching for a guitar. The question and answer:","output":"Question: What factors might be contributing to the baby's desire to reach for the guitar instead of playing with the blocks nearby? Answer: There are several factors that could be contributing to the baby's desire to reach for the guitar instead of playing with the blocks. Some possible reasons include: 1. Novelty: If the baby is more familiar with the blocks and has played with them many times before, the guitar might represent something new and intriguing, capturing the baby's curiosity and attention. 2. Sound: Guitars, when strummed or plucked, produce distinct sounds. The baby might be attracted to the potential to create noise by interacting with the guitar, which can stimulate their senses and help them learn more about their environment. 3. Visual Appeal: The guitar may have a more visually appealing design or color compared to the blocks, attracting the baby's attention. Babies tend to be attracted to bright colors and interesting shapes. 4. Imitation: The baby might have seen others, such as a parent or sibling, playing the guitar and may want to mimic that behavior. Babies often learn by imitating the actions of those around them. 5. Natural Exploration: Babies at this stage of development are generally curious and enjoy exploring their environment by reaching, grabbing, and manipulating objects. The guitar could simply be the next object in the baby's line of sight, and their desire to reach for it may be part of their natural exploratory behavior. In summary, the baby's desire to reach for the guitar instead of playing with the blocks nearby could be attributed to factors such as novelty, sound, visual appeal, imitation, or natural exploration."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: From the sidelines of the forum, Draskovic also warned that a move to give Kosovo independence would encourage separatist sentiments elsewhere and would jeopardise stability in the region.","output":"Translation to Romanian: De pe marginea forumului, Draskovic a avertizat, de asemenea, că o mișcare de acordare a independenței Kosovo ar încuraja sentimentele separatiste în alte părți și ar periclita stabilitatea în regiune.

This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Determine the total number of ears of corn Bob had initially. Bob had 50 bushels, and each bushel contained 14 ears of corn. So, we need to multiply the number of bushels by the number of ears per bushel to find the total number of ears: 50 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 700 ears of corn. Step 2: Calculate how many ears of corn his friends took. Terry took 8 bushels, Jerry took 3 bushels, and Linda took 12 bushels. To find out how many ears of corn they took, we'll multiply the number of bushels each took by 14 ears/bushel: Terry: 8 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 112 ears Jerry: 3 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 42 ears Linda: 12 bushels * 14 ears/bushel = 168 ears Step 3: Add the total number of ears taken by Terry, Jerry, and Linda. 112 ears (Terry) + 42 ears (Jerry) + 168 ears (Linda) = 322 ears Step 4: Calculate the remaining ears of corn after Bob gave some to his friends and his neighbor Stacy. Remember that Stacy took 21 ears of corn directly. So, we'll subtract the total number of ears taken by Terry, Jerry, Linda, and Stacy from the initial total number of ears: 700 ears (initial) – 322 ears (Terry, Jerry, and Linda) – 21 ears (Stacy) = 357 ears Therefore, Bob has 357 ears of corn left."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Contrary to common belief, social media websites such as Facebook do not weaken personal ties, they strengthen them in unique ways for different age groups, according to a new study.

However, the answer can be further elaborated to provide a more accurate and detailed response. Red is indeed a significant color in Chinese culture and is traditionally associated with various positive attributes like courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, happiness, passion, and fertility. However, regarding the season, depending on the context, it is generally associated with celebrations, the festival season, and well-being. One significant event, Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is widely celebrated all over China, wherein red plays an essential role in decorations and cultural symbols. As the name suggests, this celebration takes place during the spring season, which marks the arrival of warmer weather after the cold winter months. It is a time for renewal and growth, and people use red to symbolize joy, vitality, and prosperity. Hence, although red is indeed associated with positive connotations and summer in a broader sense, it is more specifically connected to the spring season celebrations, especially the Chinese New Year, in terms of cultural traditions.

Does Northern fur seal make good pet for six year old? If the answer is 'no'; explain the reasoning:","output":"No, a Northern fur seal would not make a good pet for a six-year-old or anyone else. There are several reasons for this: 1. Legal status: Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) are protected by international and domestic laws under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) worldwide. Keeping them as pets would be illegal and subject to penalties and fines. 2. Size: Northern fur seals are large animals. Adult males can grow up to 2.1 meters (7 feet) long and weigh between 140-270 kg (310-600 lbs), while adult females can reach up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long and weigh 30-50 kg (66-110 lbs). Such a size would make it difficult to provide an adequate living environment for the animal, especially in a residential home. 3. Habitat: Northern fur seals are marine mammals, which means they require an aquatic environment to thrive. They are adapted for cold water and an oceanic lifestyle, with unique requirements in terms of temperature, diet, and socialization. It would be virtually impossible to recreate their natural habitat in a home setting. 4. Diet: Fur seals have specialized dietary needs, feeding mainly on fish and squid. Providing a proper diet for a large carnivorous marine mammal would be expensive and time-consuming. 5. Behavior and socialization: Northern fur seals are social animals that live in large colonies in the wild. In captivity, they could suffer from stress and loneliness, which could lead to negative behavioral changes and aggression. Furthermore, their natural behaviors, such as loud vocalizations, aggressive behavior, and territorial instincts, would make them unsuitable as pets. 6. Safety: Handling and interacting with a large marine mammal like the Northern fur seal poses significant risks to a young child's safety. Fur seals have powerful jaws and sharp teeth and might show unpredictable behavior, especially if stressed or threatened. In summary, Northern fur seals are not suitable pets for anyone, including a six-year-old child, due to legal restrictions, the difficulty of providing a proper living environment, dietary requirements, behavioral concerns, and safety risks. Instead, it is essential to appreciate and respect these animals in their natural habitats while encouraging environmental conservation and responsible wildlife management."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston.

The first team crest was a horse sketched in blue carrying a cowboy waving a hockey stick aloft, before being changed to the familiar R-A-N-G-E-R-S in diagonal. Rickard managed to get future legendary Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe to assemble the team. However, Smythe had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man, Col. John S. Hammond, and was fired as manager-coach on the eve of the first seasonhe was paid a then-hefty 2,500 to leave. Smythe was replaced by Pacific Coast Hockey Association co-founder Lester Patrick. The new team Smythe assembled turned out to be a winner.... - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - The World Hockey Association was a professional ice hockey major league that operated in North America from 1972 to 1979. It was the first major league to compete with the National Hockey League (NHL) since the collapse of the Western Hockey League (195274). Although the WHA was not the first league since that time to attempt to challenge the NHL's supremacy, it was by far the most successful in the modern era. - An expansion team is a brand new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster. - The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the \\"Bengals\\", were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big Four League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League. The Tigers were revived in 1932, playing for a short-lived four years in the North Western Hockey League. They played their games at the Victoria Arena. - The Toronto Maple Leafs (officially the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club) are a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team is one of the \\"Original Six\\" league members. They are owned by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Ltd. and are represented by Chairman Larry Tanenbaum. In February 1999, they moved to the Air Canada Centre, which replaced Maple Leaf Gardens, the team's home since 1931. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015. - The Colorado Avalanche are a professional ice hockey team based in Denver, Colorado. They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Avalanche are the only team in their division not based in the Central Time Zone; the team is situated in the Mountain Time Zone. Their home arena is Pepsi Center. Their general manager is Joe Sakic. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The Calgary Flames are a professional ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The club is the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the Calgary Tigers (19211927) and Calgary Cowboys (19751977). The Flames are one of two NHL franchises in Alberta; the other is the Edmonton Oilers. The cities' proximity has led to a rivalry known as the Battle of Alberta. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947. - The major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the United States and Canada. The four leagues universally included in the definition are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

Options: - shelf - home - house - basement - cupboard Hmmm, let me think.","output":"Storing a board game depends on factors such as the size of the board game, accessibility, and preference for how you want to organize your space. Here are some suggestions based on the options provided: 1. Shelf: This is a popular choice for storing board games as it allows for easy access and visibility. You can place your board game on a shelf in a living room, bedroom, or game room, ensuring that it is readily available when you want to play it. If you have multiple board games, you can organize them by size, genre, or frequency of use. 2. Home / House: Since this option is quite general, storing a board game in any location within your home is viable, as long as it is placed in a secure location where it won't be easily damaged or lost. This choice gives you flexibility in deciding the best spot to store your board game based on your individual preferences and home layout. 3. Basement: A basement can be a great option if you have limited space in the main living areas of your home or if you are storing board games that are not frequently used. Make sure to store them in well-organized containers or shelves to prevent damage from potential moisture or pests. 4. Cupboard: Storing a board game in a cupboard is another convenient option. You can designate space in a cupboard or cabinet within your living room, bedroom, or game room for your board games. This option keeps the games out of sight when not in use, which is helpful for maintaining a clean and organized appearance. In conclusion, the best place to store a board game depends on your personal preference and the layout of your home. Shelves and cupboards are popular choices, as they provide easy access and help to maintain an organized appearance, but basements and other storage areas within the house may also be suitable if you have limited space or want to store rarely-played games."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A baby looks in a drawer full of toys and wash clothes.\\" that \\"A baby looking in a drawer.\\"?

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners?

A torrential rain closes nearby roads, causing Sergeant Melling of the police to bring condemned murderer Valerie Carns there. She is being taken to prison. Valerie was convicted of poisoning her brother Jason, a pianist. Jason's physician, Dr. Jeffreys, is head of the hospital where Sister Mary now works. Valerie still proclaims her innocence, but Jeffreys insists that she gave Jason a fatal overdose of his medicine. A photograph of Jason clearly disturbs Isabel Jeffreys, the doctor's wife.

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.

Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening.

We can eliminate the 'pool table' option because bouncing a ball against a wall is not part of a pool game and there would be no target on the wall. 3. The 'toy box' option can also be eliminated as it is simply a storage container for toys, and not a location where Billy would play with a ball and target. 4. The 'closet' option seems unlikely, as there is typically not enough space in a closet for playing games and bouncing balls against a targeted wall. 5.

Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways.

The secretive company released its first transparency report on Tuesday, breaking down the number of account and device data requests it received from law enforcement by country for the first half of 2013. The United States submitted the most requests for account information, with 1,000 to 2,000 requests regarding 2,000 to 3,000 individual accounts. These requests might be for personal information found in iTunes, Game Center and iCloud accounts. The vast majority of requests the company receives are from law enforcement agencies trying to track down lost or stolen phones, tablets and computers on behalf of Apple customers. Apple received 3,542 of these \\"device information\\" requests in the U.S. for 8,605 devices, and Apple turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time. Germany made the second largest number of device requests, followed by Singapore. This is the first time Apple has released a transparency report. Google began disclosing data about its government requests in 2011 and releases an updated list every six months. Since the initial revelations about surveillance by the National Security Agency came to light earlier this year, there has been an uptick in the number of tech companies voluntarily releasing statistics on the government requests they get. Apple joins Facebook, Yahoo and other tech companies taking part in a practice that is fast becoming industry standard. \\"Apple is so secretive about everything it does, the fact that it is opening up shows that transparency really is the new standard, and the consumers are demanding it,\\" said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Though the information in the reports is somewhat standard, Apple did included something different. The last line under the notes section in the report says, \\"Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us.\\" Section 215 is the part of the Patriot Act the NSA could use to compel companies to hand over user data. If Apple did receive such an order, it would likely be accompanied by a gag order so Apple would not even be able to say that it did or did not receive a 215 request. Cardozo says this type of disclosure is called a canary, and Apple is the first major tech company to include it. \\"Six months from now, we will look to make sure that line is included, and if they don't say they have not received a 215 request, we can assume they have,\\" said Cardozo. Apple also joined Yahoo and Google and filed a brief in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court asking for more transparency to discuss government requests openly and in more detail. Currently, the U.S. government only allows companies to talk about how many national security orders, including the numbers of accounts impacted, in ranges of thousands. \\"We have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share, and Apple will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive,\\" Apple said in the report. The other information in Apple's report was fairly standard. It's difficult to compare Apple's numbers directly to those previously disclosed by companies such as Facebook and Google. Though they're all technology companies, they are vastly different businesses and store different amounts and types of data about their users. \\"Our business does not depend on collecting personal data. We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers,\\" Apple said in the beginning of the report. That statement seems to be dig directed at companies such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and many others that do base their businesses on collecting their customers' personal information. The hunger for personal data isn't limited to governments as it's also very lucrative for many technology companies. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

I’ve gone off and done it. I’ve managed to create the most politically incorrect Christmas show in America. My two-hour Fox Radio extravaganza declares that Jesus is the reason for the season – loud and proud. Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! “The Todd Starnes Christmas Show” will air on hundreds of radio stations around the nation and FoxNews.com has a broadcast version which you can watch here. The show includes a Living Nativity, flying angels, shepherds and the Christmas story – delivered directly from the New Testament at Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee. We also have a stage full of line dancing Santa Clauses, celebrity singers like Jason Crabb, Meredith Andrews and the Mylon Hayes Family. Oh, and there’s a massive Christmas tree filled singing young people. You have to watch the video to truly appreciate the magnitude of 140,000 sparkling lights. It makes the Rockefeller Christmas Tree look like that scrawny Charlie Brown tree. As you can tell, my show has high concentrations of cultural appropriation that could cause severe microaggressions among some millennials and free-thinkers. I posted a warning at the beginning of the program urging fragile snowflakes to seek shelter in a safe space until after the angels have harkened the herald. It's beyond reason that a season celebrating peace on earth is so despised by secular humanists. Before grandpa can swipe the last piece of pumpkin pie, the atheists and agnostics and free-thinkers are waging battles over Santa Claus and reindeer, candy canes and Christmas Choirs. This year, schools took issue with “A Christmas Carol” and “A Charlie Brown Christmas” and one university published a screed urging people to host “all-inclusive” holiday parties. Meanwhile, the atheists and agnostics doubled down on their efforts to eradicate town square Nativities from sea to shining sea. And don’t even get me started with the Satanists. The motley crew of godless Grinches have shown no mercy to either the sacred or the secular. But when it comes to protesting the holy days of other religions, the atheists and agnostics and Satanists are curiously quiet. I don’t seem to recall the Satanists posting a Satanic pentagram outside a mosque. Some call it a war on Christmas -- but it goes much deeper than just hating a holiday. It's a war on the very foundation of our nation -- the essence of who we are as a people. We are one nation under God. A God who sent his son to be born in the city of David -- a savior -- who is Christ the Lord. That is what Christmas is all about -- and that is why the secular humanists so despise this Yuletide season. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process. Releasing water gradually is a planned, controlled action that is incorporated into the dam's operation to improve safety from flooding. The gradual release of the floodwater directly impacts the steps of the process. The dam is built in an area prone to flooding, and its main function is to prevent flood damage. The gradual release of water is integrated into the dam's design and operation, which makes it a direct impact on the process of preventing flood damage. When a large amount of rain occurs, water builds up behind the dam. To ensure the structure's integrity and to avoid further flooding, the dam operators would open the floodgates when the water level starts to get dangerously high. This controlled release of water flows into the river below the dam. The gradual release of water is a crucial part of the process, as it directly affects the dam's ability to prevent flood damage. By releasing water slowly, the pressure on the dam and the water volume in the river below are managed, which helps protect the surrounding area from flooding. This process promotes improved safety from flooding, as the dam is working effectively to control and manage the water levels. Once the gates are closed, and the water level behind the dam is under control, the dam may occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water. This process is done to maintain safe water levels and to continue protecting the surrounding area from flooding. In this scenario, the gradual release of water is a direct perturbation since it impacts a step of the process positively. It is an essential measure taken by the dam's operators to regulate water levels and minimize the risk of flooding in the surrounding area."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: What is the Scottish name for All Saints Day, a Christian ceremony grafted onto an ancient pagan ceremony?","output":"To find the correct answer to this question, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the key terms in the question: Scottish name, All Saints Day, Christian ceremony, ancient pagan ceremony. 2. Research the key terms to find relevant information. 3. Analyze the information gathered to determine the Scottish name for All Saints Day. Step 1: Identifying key terms - Scottish name: Indicates the term I am searching for is specific to Scotland. - All Saints Day: A Christian celebration, usually observed on November 1 in Western Christianity. - Christian ceremony: Indicates the holiday has Christian origins or elements. - Ancient pagan ceremony: Suggests that the holiday was initially a non-Christian or pre-Christian celebration, later incorporated into Christianity. Step 2: Researching key terms Upon researching All Saints Day and its association with pagan ceremonies, I found that this Christian celebration was indeed grafted onto an ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain, observed from October 31 to November 1. Step 3: Analyzing the information According to the research, in Scotland, this Christianized version of Samhain is commonly referred to as Hallowmas, a term that combines \\"Hallow\\" (meaning \\"holy\\" or \\"sacred\\") with \\"mas\\" (short for \\"Mass\\", the Christian celebration). In conclusion, the Scottish name for All Saints Day, a Christian ceremony grafted onto an ancient pagan ceremony, is Hallowmas."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?.

Van den Wildenberg said she had received reports that some","output":"peacekeepers were still missing and that an intense search and rescue operation was underway. Local authorities, villagers, and U.N. personnel were working closely together to locate them and ensure their safety. The identities of the attackers responsible for the ambush are not yet known. However, initial investigations point to a possible involvement of armed militias or rebel groups operating in the region. The area has been plagued by unrest and violence due to political instability and conflicts over natural resources, such as cocoa production. In response to the incident, Ban Ki-moon, along with other international leaders, has called for an immediate investigation to identify and bring those responsible to justice. A joint task force has been established, including members of the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Ivorian security forces, and regional partners. The United Nations Security Council has also convened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Ivory Coast, expressing their deep concern for the deteriorating security situation and extending their condolences to the families of the fallen peacekeepers. The Council urged all parties to cooperate with the investigation and emphasized the need for stability in the region. In light of the attack, the U.N. Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) has stepped up patrols and security measures in the area, particularly around border regions where armed groups are known to operate. The UNOCI mission will continue to work closely with national authorities, as well as local and regional partners, to prevent further violence and protect vulnerable civilian populations. Meanwhile, the governments of Niger and Ivory Coast, in coordination with the United Nations and their regional partners, have agreed to enhance their collaboration to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. This includes increased information sharing, joint operations, and investment in capacity building for local security forces. The incident has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast. Some critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of conflict in the region, such as poverty, lack of development, and political divisions. They call for a comprehensive approach, which includes greater investment in education, job creation, and reconciliation programs. In conclusion, the tragic loss of seven peacekeepers has underscored the ongoing challenges faced by the United Nations and regional actors in fostering peace and stability in Ivory Coast. As the investigation into the ambush continues, the international community must work in unity to ensure justice for the fallen soldiers and redouble their efforts towards establishing lasting peace in the region."},{"instruction":"Story: Francisco was excited to become an accountant one day.

Question 2: Can a person with extremely low tolerance to weed get high of off tiny traces of THC? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are similar, but they are asking about different aspects of exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke and low-tolerance individuals. Let's break down the two questions separately and analyze the differences. Question 1: \\"Is it hard to get a second hand high from weed even if you have a low tolerance?\\" This question focuses on whether it is difficult for someone with a low tolerance to marijuana to experience a second-hand high (also known as a contact high) from being in the presence of marijuana smoke. In other words, it asks if someone with a low tolerance can get high, even without directly consuming the drug, simply by being exposed to the smoke in the air. Question 2: \\"Can a person with extremely low tolerance to weed get high off of tiny traces of THC?\\" While this question also relates to individuals with low tolerance to marijuana, it specifically targets the idea of whether these people can get high from minuscule amounts of THC, which is the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. This question leans more towards the potency of THC in small quantities and how it would affect a person with low tolerance. Answering the questions: It's important to know that several factors can influence the potential for a second-hand high. These factors include the concentration of THC in the marijuana, the size and ventilation of the room, and the duration of exposure to the smoke. For example, if a room is small, unventilated, and filled with smoke for a prolonged period, there is a higher chance for second-hand high. Although it is generally considered challenging to get a second-hand high (Question 1) as the concentration of THC in second-hand smoke is relatively low, someone with an extremely low tolerance to marijuana might experience some mild psychoactive effects. However, these effects are likely to be far less potent than if they directly consumed THC. In a well-ventilated environment, it's unlikely that the person with low tolerance would experience any noticeable effects. Regarding Question 2, it is still unlikely for an individual with low tolerance to get high solely from tiny traces of THC, as the concentration will likely not be sufficient to induce psychoactive effects. Human bodies have different sensitivity levels to THC; however, the traces from second-hand smoke are generally not enough to produce significant effects for most individuals, even those with a low tolerance. In conclusion, while both questions touch on the possible effects of marijuana smoke on people with low tolerance, they target different aspects of this issue. Question 1 asks about second-hand high occurrence based on the given condition, while Question 2 addresses the question of whether tiny traces of THC can impact low-tolerance individuals. Overall, it's unlikely for someone with low tolerance to get high from either second-hand smoke or minimal THC traces, although the chance of experiencing mild effects may be higher with prolonged exposure under specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"Article:The attack happened in the Jenkins Dale area of Chatham at 17:26 BST.

Evidence 2 and 4 elaborate on the potential limitations of uranium supplies and the fact that nuclear energy might become more expensive or even unavailable in the long run due to scarcity. This suggests that relying heavily on nuclear energy may not be sustainable. 2. Evidence 5 emphasizes that while there might be alternative sources for uranium production, such as extraction from seawater, these methods would likely have higher costs, with concerns raised around the producers keeping cheaper uranium for themselves while exporting at higher prices. 3. Evidence 6 and 8 point out that the European Union has a goal to become less dependent on imported materials for energy production. With the risks associated with relying on nuclear energy, such as potential scarcity and likely increase in costs, the EU's energy self-sufficiency could be undermined if it continues to rely heavily on nuclear power. 4. Evidence 7 reminds us that as a non-renewable resource, it is important to consider the possibility of supplies running out, which could be detrimental to the energy sector and lead to further complications in the future when trying to find alternative sources of energy. 5. Evidence 9 suggests that this reliance on nuclear energy and the potential limitations of uranium resources may pose a serious threat to the future, which could have implications on energy security and the stability of the global energy market. 6. Evidence 10 highlights a common fact that natural resources are often used as the first intermediates of diplomatic disputes. Therefore, if countries rely too heavily on non-renewable resources like uranium and face resource scarcity, this could lead to geopolitical tensions and conflicts. In conclusion, the body of evidence provided supports the claim that a reliance on nuclear energy, specifically uranium, may lead to increased long-term costs, limited resources, and hinder the European Union's goal of achieving energy self-sufficiency."},{"instruction":"Briefly summarize this sentence: former workers at a chicken processing plant who were caught on tape allegedly kicking , stomping and slamming chickens against the wall will not face criminal charges , a prosecutor said .

Options: - apply for job - win auction - stand in line - take care of proposals - buy christmas presents","output":"If you want to get free stuff that is worth money, the best option from the choices given would be to stand in line. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Apply for a job: While applying for a job can eventually give you income, it does not directly provide free stuff. You would still need to use your earned money to buy things, so this option won't give you immediate freebies. 2. Win auction: Winning an auction does not equate to getting free stuff. Although you could potentially obtain items at a lower price, you are still required to pay for them. So, this option won't allow you to get things for free. 3. Stand in line: There are situations wherein standing in line could lead to receiving free things. For example, stores and companies sometimes organize promotional events where they hand out free samples, giveaways or offer limited-time discounts. Also, popular events such as product launches and grand opening ceremonies might offer free items for those first in line. Hence, standing in line may get you something of value for free. 4. Take care of proposals: Taking care of proposals mainly involves preparing and managing business proposals which typically won't directly provide you with free stuff that is worth money. This option is not suitable for acquiring free items. 5. Buy Christmas presents: Buying presents involves spending money, not receiving free items. Although you might be able to find deals during the holiday season, you still need to pay for the gifts, which is not the same as getting free stuff. To sum up, if your goal is to get free stuff that is worth money, the best option out of the given choices is to stand in line at promotional events or during special occasions where companies or stores offer free items or deep discounts. This way, you might be able to acquire valuable items without spending any money."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Aaron Boogaard, birthYear, 1986; Aaron Boogaard, height, 1.905; Aaron Boogaard, club, Wichita Thunder; Aaron Boogaard, birthPlace, Canada.

When he discovered that his father's death is impending, he makes a deal with a man named Roarke (Ciarán Hinds) who claims to be the Devil in exchange for his soul and a curse to be set upon him. Johnny now hosts an entity called 'The Rider', a fiery demon who punishes sinners, no matter how petty the crimes are. However, his father dies regardless, and having two minds fighting for control over his new powers, Johnny attempts to stay as far away from mankind as possible, hiding out in Eastern Europe (Romania).In the present, a drunken priest named Moreau (Idris Elba) attempts to warn the order of monks residing in a castle that the Devil has sent out forces to retrieve a certain boy and his mother hiding there, despite the head monk's (Anthony Head) reassurances of their safety. At that moment, mercenaries hired by Roarke breach the castle and kill all of the monks except for Moreau, while the mother, Nadya (Violante Placido) and her son Danny escape. Moreau chases after them, as well as the mercenaries. Trying to protect Nadya and her son, Moreau is driven off a cliff before he shoots the mercenaries' tires, delaying them before they can go after Danny and Nadya. He survives, as a tree breaks his fall. Moreau seeks out Johnny, who has been living in isolation in an abandoned village. Johnny initially refuses to help Moreau locate the mother and her son, but after he is promised that Moreau's ancient order can exorcise the curse from his soul, he agrees.Nadya and Danny are found by the mercenaries, who drive their car off the highway and crash it.

Also stick to the context of the given story. For example, if the story talks about \\"doctors\\", you can talk about \\"health\\" or \\"diagnosis\\", but don't mention \\"aliens\\". Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. Avoid simply negating the original middle, for example: \\"She likes cakes.\\" is changed to \\"She doesn't like cakes.\\" Input: Beginning: Jean had always wanted to leave her big city life for the countryside. Middle: Jean traveled to Vermont. Ending: Upon seeing Vermont, Jean decided to leave the city and never return. Output:","output":"Part #1: Shown a three-part story with a beginning, middle, and ending. Usage: Beginning: Jean had always wanted to leave her big city life for the countryside. Middle: Jean traveled to Vermont. Ending: Upon seeing Vermont, Jean decided to leave the city and never return. This demonstrates the initial three-part structure of the story. Part #2: Slightly modify the middle part to make the story unlikely, improbable, or inconsistent. Usage: Middle: \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" This changes the story, making it unlikely. Jean wanted to move to the countryside, but Antarctica is neither big city nor countryside, introducing an inconsistency in the story. Part #3: The modification must not add more than 4 new words or remove existing ones. Usage: Middle: \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" This sentence substitutes Vermont with Antarctica, hence maintaining the original sentence's word count and structure. Thus, it only modifies one word without adding or removing more than 4 words. Part #4: The sentence should be grammatically and syntactically correct. Usage: Middle: \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (Jean), a verb (traveled) and an object (Antarctica). Part #5: Stick to the context of the given story. Usage: In the story, Jean's desire to move from the city to the countryside is the main context. Changing her destination to Antarctica, a place that doesn't fit her initial desire, still sticks to the main idea of transitioning locations without introducing elements outside the established context. Part #6: Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information. Usage: Middle: \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" This modification only substitutes the destination, without adding any extra, irrelevant information to the story. Part #7: Use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he/she). Usage: Middle: \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" This sentence maintains the usage of the name, Jean, instead of switching to a pronoun. Part #8: Avoid simply negating the original middle. Usage: The change from \\"Jean traveled to Vermont.\\" to \\"Jean traveled to Antarctica.\\" is not negation. It changes the destination, thus tweaking the story, rather than simply contradicting the initial narrative."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops.

Another woman said she was about to get into her car when the hole opened under it. \\"It could have happened to me,\\" she said. The AP attributes the hole to recent heavy rain in the area. A city water department official tells the Tribune that the rain may have helped break a nearly 100-year-old water main, which in turn caused the sinkhole. Expand this summary.","output":"A massive sinkhole emerged on the Southeast Side of Chicago, causing substantial damage and even sending one individual to the hospital, according to a report by the Chicago Tribune. Three cars were swallowed by the sinkhole as it expanded across the area, marking a significant, unexpected event for the residents and commuters in the vicinity. One of the most severely impacted victims was a man who attempted to maneuver his vehicle around the sinkhole as it suddenly widened beneath him. Unfortunately, his car fell in, causing him to sustain minor head injuries. He was promptly taken to a nearby hospital for examination and treatment. Meanwhile, another woman shared her close brush with the dramatic episode, revealing that she was just about to enter her car when the sinkhole formed beneath it. Recognizing the potential danger she had avoided, she said: \\"It could have happened to me.\\" The Associated Press has attributed the sinkhole to recent bouts of heavy rainfall in the region. Such extreme weather can lead to the weakening and erosion of the soil, making it more susceptible to collapse and creating conditions suitable for the formation of sinkholes. In addition to the rainfall, a city water department official informed the Tribune that the heavy downpour might have also contributed to the breaking of a nearly century-old water main. The ensuing water leakage would have further destabilized the soil and exacerbated the situation, ultimately resulting in the massive sinkhole that appeared. This incident highlights the potential hazards posed by aging infrastructure and extreme weather events. The need for regular monitoring and maintenance of critical systems such as water mains cannot be underestimated, particularly in light of the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters driven by climate change. Public safety depends on ensuring the proper functioning of these essential structures, as their failure could have catastrophic consequences, as illustrated in this case. Moving forward, the city of Chicago and other urban centers will need to continue to assess and invest in their infrastructure systems to reduce the risk of such incidents and ensure the safety of their citizens. This will likely involve implementing regular inspections, updating infrastructure standards, and providing greater resources for maintenance and repair initiatives, especially as climate change intensifies the threats faced."},{"instruction":"Background: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market...

Erin had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal. b). Natalie had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal.","output":"Erin had long believed in ghosts and the paranormal. From a young age, she had been captivated by stories of spirits, haunted places, and the unexplained phenomena that seemed to defy what everyone knew to be true about the world. Naturally, she tended toward superstition in her everyday life, often attributing bizarre occurrences to the ghosts that she believed walked among the living. Natalie, on the other hand, was the polar opposite. A devout skeptic, she was unwavering in her conviction that every strange occurrence could be explained with enough logical scrutiny. While Erin attended paranormal conventions and read up on otherworldly beings, Natalie immersed herself in all things science-related. In her view, the natural world was infinitely more fascinating than the fictitious plane of existence imagined by those who indulged in supernatural fantasies. Yet, despite their remarkably different viewpoints, the two friends shared a remarkably strong bond. In part, their friendship had endured simply because they were constantly challenging each other's beliefs. On more than one occasion, they had found themselves in the midst of a heated debate about the validity of a ghostly testimonial, the preposterous nature of the paranormal investigator's methods, or the statistical probability of spirits existing. Ironically, it seemed as though their disagreements only solidified their trust in each other. Now, the old Victorian house before them stood as a testament to their enduring friendship and ever-present rivalry. Their interest in the house had been piqued when they came across an article in the local newspaper noting its sordid past and ghostly legends. It was the haunted house that would ultimately determine the ultimate victor between the two. Erin was sure that this would finally give her the opportunity to prove to Natalie that ghosts were real. The house itself was like something out of a horror novel, its ancient wood groaning and creaking under the weight of some unseen force. The grounds were shrouded in an aura of mystery, drawing her into its haunting depths. Natalie, however, refused to be swayed by Erin's presumptions. To her, the house was simply an old building with an overgrown garden and an interesting history. The fact that people told ghost stories about it was nothing more than a byproduct of human imagination and fear of the unknown. She was determined to use this opportunity to show Erin that there were rational explanations for every positively chilling detail she would no doubt stumble upon during their investigation. Together, the friends entered the house armed with notepads, flashlights, and recording devices. For two nights, they sought paranormal activity in every nook and cranny of the dilapidated home, their eyes peeled for any sign of apparitions or other supernatural phenomena. Erin would gasp and point out cold spots, orbs, and unexplained sounds, while Natalie documented each instance and offered her own natural explanation. Yet, neither the skeptic nor the believer was ready to admit defeat. On the third night, they ventured into the dusty attic. The air was heavy with anticipation as they sifted through the piles of forgotten heirlooms. Just as Erin began to lose hope of ever finding definitive proof of the ghostly inhabitants she believed haunted the house, Natalie stumbled upon a mysterious, leather-bound journal. Although she had discovered it by chance, the journal's contents were far from ordinary. In her quest to disprove the paranormal, Natalie had unwittingly stumbled upon the memoir of an occultist who had once lived in the house. As they delved into the troubling confessions of the journal's owner, delusions of grandeur and sinister experiments came to light. Erin and Natalie's friendship evolved as they recognized that the eerie occurrences within the house stemmed from the tenuous line between the paranormal and human psychology. Ultimately, their journey bound them together with a newfound respect for the inexplicable mysteries of the world, as well as the spaces that lay between the realm of the living and the beyond."},{"instruction":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what track and field event for me?

Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. But I can use this background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster.

Mr Brown insisted the rise of UKIP – topping the European elections last month – was not the result of public anger over immigration or Europe, but fears about the ‘juggernaut’ of global change and Britain’s place in the world.

Brown continued, saying, 'We must recognise that Britain's strength lies in its openness, diversity, and adaptability in the face of global challenges. UKIP's rise to prominence only serves to distract us from tackling these important issues head-on.' The former Prime Minister called for unity, encouraging both the Labour party and the entire nation to work together towards a more inclusive, forward-thinking mindset. Brown acknowledged the importance of addressing legitimate concerns surrounding immigration and Europe, but emphasized the need to approach these topics with nuance and understanding rather than fear or hostility.

Your veterinarian will give the cat an injection in order to treat the ulcer. Depending on the chosen steroid, these injections will be given once every two to three weeks, until the sores have disappeared. Rodent ulcers can also be treated by giving your cat prednisone orally. Your veterinarian will prescribe pills that are given orally every 24 hours until the lesions are gone. In order to properly administer the medication, follow the directions provided by your veterinarian. In some instances the ulcers may become infected. If this happens, your vet will likely prescribe an antibiotic in order to treat the infection alongside the lesions. Take the antibiotics as directed by the veterinarian. Some vets believe that essential fatty acids can help relieve stress in cats and reduce allergic reactions in some instances. If you are not feeding your cat a premium food, they may not get enough fatty acid in their diet. Change to a new food that is higher in essential fatty acids or give your cat a supplement, as directed by their vet. Rodent ulcers are typically caused by an allergic reaction.

Options: - toilet - porch - greenhouse - cupboard - restaurant The answer is \\"restaurant\\" because A:","output":"In a restaurant, you would most likely find a pot that is being used by someone for various reasons. Since restaurants are commercial establishments that specialize in preparing and serving meals, pots are indispensable kitchen tools that chefs and cooks use regularly. First, a pot can be used for cooking a wide variety of dishes. This could include boiling vegetables in water or broth, simmering a delicious soup, or cooking a rich pasta sauce. The fact that many types of meals require the use of a pot means that, in a restaurant setting, there is a high probability of at least one pot being in use at any given time. Second, the use of pots in a restaurant is often related to the constant need to heat multiple components of a dish at the same time. For example, a busy kitchen may need a pot of boiling water for blanching vegetables, a large pot for simmering soup, and another for cooking rice or pasta, all at the same time. This is because many dishes require the various elements to be cooked at specific times and temperatures to create the perfect harmony of flavors. Third, pots are usually made of durable materials such as stainless steel or cast iron, which are designed to withstand high temperatures and constant use. This makes them ideal for a fast-paced restaurant environment where chefs and cooks need their tools to be reliable and able to endure heavy use. Now, let's quickly address the other options provided: - Toilet: A pot used in the toilet context most likely refers to a chamber pot, which is not the same as a pot used for cooking. A chamber pot is a container used to collect human waste before modern plumbing and indoor restrooms. This option does not make sense since the pot is not being used for cooking purposes. - Porch: While a pot might be found on a porch, it would most likely be a flower pot used for gardening and not for cooking. It is uncommon to see someone using a pot for cooking on a porch. - Greenhouse: A greenhouse is a structure intended for the growth of plants and flowers, not for cooking purposes. Just like with the porch, you might find a flower pot there, but not a pot being used to cook. - Cupboard: While you could find a pot in a cupboard when it is not being used, the question specifically asked for a pot being used by someone. Since a pot in a cupboard is in storage, it does not fit the requirement of being actively used. In conclusion, the answer \\"restaurant\\" makes the most logical sense as the place where you would find a pot being used by someone because restaurants are commercial establishments that specialize in the preparation and serving of food. Pots are essential tools in cooking various dishes, making it highly probable that at least one pot is in use within a restaurant kitchen at any given time. The other options do not align well with a pot being used for cooking purposes or being actively used."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul.

They used a special type of science called DNA to see if he was the one who did it. The DNA matched, which means Joseph Zieler was the bad person who hurt the little girl and her babysitter. Robin's mommy was not home that night, and she found both Robin and Lisa when she returned the next morning. The bad man had done terrible things like hurting them and not allowing them to breathe, which made them go to heaven. The detectives didn't know if there was any connection between Joseph Zieler and the girl and her babysitter before this happened. The case of finding the person who hurt Robin and Lisa was even talked about on a TV show called America's Most Wanted. Joseph Zieler has been charged with doing very bad things, like hurting other people and sexual assault. Now that he is caught, he will face the consequences for his actions, and people will remember Robin and Lisa and the tragedy that happened a long time ago."},{"instruction":"Translate to Romanian: According to the 2002 Romanian census, more than 500,000 Roma live in the country, the second biggest minority population after the Hungarians.

Options: - yes - no","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the information and analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identifying the subject and key elements The subject in question is Zadar, and the key elements are: - Urban structure had been formed during the Greek times - The town had no forts - The city walls had no towers and gates Step 2: Researching the historical background of Zadar Zadar is a city in Croatia, located on the Adriatic Sea coast. Its history dates back to ancient times when it was first settled by the Liburnians, an Illyrian tribe. Later on, it was conquered by the Romans and became a Roman colony. Step 3: Analyzing the connection to Greek times and urban structure Zadar was not a Greek city, but a Liburnian settlement, and then a Roman colony. The main urban structure might have been influenced by the Romans rather than Greek times. Step 4: Analyzing the claim of no forts, towers, and gates in city walls During the Roman era, Zadar was fortified by walls, towers, and gates, as can be seen in some of the remaining structures today. Therefore, the city walls did have towers and gates. Step 5: Drawing a conclusion Considering the historical background of Zadar and its urban structure, it seems the claim is not accurate. Therefore, the answer is: - No"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Ash called the dog often in order for the dog to learn its name. Given the context: How would Ash feel as a result? Possible answers: playful, very accomplished, satisfied with her progress A:","output":"Ash would most likely feel satisfied with her progress. Training a dog is an undertaking that needs patience, consistency, and perseverance. When Ash calls her dog often and in a consistent manner, she is establishing a system of communication, effectively teaching the dog to respond to its name. In the process of dog training, each small triumph, such as the dog learning its name and responding appropriately, becomes a joyous moment that would make Ash feel satisfied. It's a sign that the time and effort invested in training the dog are yielding results. It's both a relief to see progress and an encouragement to pursue further training. This satisfaction may also stem from Ash's understanding of the bigger picture. Each training milestone achieved, like the dog learning and responding to its name, is one step closer to having a well-behaved, obedient canine companion. This progress could mean a safer, more seamless interaction with the dog in various scenarios. Moreover, Ash might derive a certain gratification from developing a deeper connection with her dog. At first glance, calling a dog by its name repeatedly may appear like a simple command-based activity. However, each successful interaction adds to the building of a stronger bond between Ash and her dog. This bond can make the process of training more rewarding and personally satisfying for Ash. While there's a chance she might also feel very accomplished or playful, the given context emphasizes more on the repetitive training process and achieving results, suggesting that \\"satisfied with her progress\\" is the most fitting option among the provided choices. It's feasible that Ash might feel playful during training sessions to keep them engaging for the dog, and indeed, she might feel very accomplished when bigger milestones are achieved. But in this specific case, with the focus on the repetition of calling the dog by its name to reinforce learning, the sense of satisfaction with seeing progress is the most apt description of what Ash would probably feel."},{"instruction":"Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Answer:","output":"Zone B would likely see more organisms than Zone A because it is not declared as a dead zone. Dead zones have low oxygen levels, making it difficult for most organisms to survive, whereas lakes without such issues can support a healthier and more diverse ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

A. yes. B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","output":"C. no. The hypothesis \\"I was desperate to buy a house\\" is contradictory to the premise \\"and the buying a house was the last thing that I wanted to do.\\" The premise indicates a reluctance, lack of interest, or opposition towards buying a house. It shows that the person wasn't eager or willing to buy a house and instead, it was something they preferred to avoid or delay as much as possible. This sentiment could be driven by a variety of reasons, such as financial constraints, not finding a house they liked, being comfortable with their current living situation, or simply not being ready to take on the responsibilities that come with owning a home. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a sense of urgency, eagerness, or a strong desire to buy a house. It suggests that the person was driven, whether by necessity or desire, to actively seek and purchase a house. This kind of behavior could be attributed to factors such as a growing family needing more space, a desire for investment, finding a dream house, or wanting to establish roots in a certain neighborhood or city. Given these opposing sentiments conveyed by the premise and hypothesis, the hypothesis doesn't hold up to the given premise. Therefore, the answer would be option C, which states that the hypothesis \\"I was desperate to buy a house\\" is not true given the provided premise which states \\"and the buying a house was the last thing that I wanted to do.\\" These two statements cannot stand true simultaneously due to their contrasting nature."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

But it wasn't an ordinary bike. As he pedaled, the President stayed in place, while the energy from his pedaling powered a water filtration system. He was testing an invention created by a team of 14 students from Northeast High School, in Oakland Park, Florida. Payton Karr, 16, and Kiona Elliot, 18, attended the fair as representatives of the project.\\"We were hoping President Obama would ride the bike, but we didn't actually expect him to,\\" Payton told TFK. \\" It really meant a lot.\\" Kiona agreed. \\"It was pretty awesome to see the invention, which was invented by a group of 14 high school students and one teacher, along with the help of community members, got the interest of the leader of our nation,\\" she said. The project was an idea that came about after one of the Northeast students, Kalie Hoke, visited Haiti after the terrible 2010 earthquake and saw how difficult it was to find clean water. The students invented a portable , bicycle-powered emergency water filtration system, which can provide 20-30 people with drinking water in a 15-hour period. The teens hope their invention will one day be used by relief organizations like the Red Cross. \\" They can take it to places after natural disasters so that water can be clean for the people there,\\" said Payton. Payton and Kiona were among the 100 students from more than 40 states invited to the third annual White House Science Fair, in Washington, D.C., which is also attended by leaders in science and education.

For a sound wave, how does the amplitude affect the frequency? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. How do I correlate amplitude to the natural frequency? Step 1: Understand the concepts Amplitude refers to the maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position. Natural frequency is the frequency at which a system oscillates when not driven or damped by any external forces. Step 2: Assess the correlation Amplitude and natural frequency are independent properties of a wave. The amplitude represents the \\"size\\" of the oscillation, while the natural frequency represents how often the oscillation occurs. They are separate characteristics and do not directly affect one another. Therefore, there is no direct correlation between the amplitude and natural frequency. 2. For a sound wave, how does the amplitude affect the frequency? Step 1: Understand the concepts In a sound wave, amplitude is related to the loudness of the sound and frequency to its pitch. Both amplitude and frequency are independent properties of sound waves. Step 2: Assess the connection While amplitude and frequency are independent, one could argue that in certain situations, particularly involving human perception, a change in amplitude can cause a perceived change in frequency. However, this connection is only a perception and, physically, they remain separate characteristics of sound waves. In conclusion, amplitude does not directly affect the frequency of a sound wave. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? The questions are related as they both discuss the relationship between amplitude and frequency. Nonetheless, they differ slightly since the first concerns the correlation between amplitude and natural frequency (a more specific concept applied to oscillatory systems), whereas the second question pertains to the effect of amplitude on frequency in the context of sound waves."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the quiz \\"Mollusks have a circulatory system with one or two hearts that move blood into what?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar.

Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2. 1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last. Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\". It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.","output":"This text is about Talking Heads, an American rock band that was formed in 1975 in New York City and was active until 1991.

As public figures, they also took the opportunity to lay to rest some of the most widespread rumors, particularly the claim that Solange was intoxicated during the incident. \\"Solange, Jay, and Beyoncé have always been a close-knit family,\\" reads the statement. \\"We love each other, and above all else, we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.\\" The family's united front in addressing the matter solidifies their commitment to moving beyond the controversy, both personally and professionally. In the wake of the leaked footage, fans and observers alike could not help but dissect the incident and formulate theories as to its cause. The speculation spiraled out of control as conflicting reports and sources offered alleged explanations, ranging from personal disputes to infidelity-related accusations, often vilifying Solange Knowles. However, the unified response from Solange, Jay Z, and Beyoncé now serves to refute such characterizations, reminding the public that the inner workings of even high-profile families should remain private matters. Their concise yet clear statement sends a strong message: they want to move forward from the upheaval triggered by the leaked video and focus on their relationship as a family. In an ever-invasive media landscape, it is not uncommon for celebrities to find their private lives exposed and scrutinized. The Knowles-Carter family's response to the elevator incident demonstrates an admirable display of solidarity and restraint in the face of adversity. By directly addressing the matter and refuting some of the most widely circulated falsehoods, they have taken control of the narrative, reinforcing the image of a strong, resilient family unit that will stand together come what may. Rather than further fueling the controversy with a lengthy public discussion, Solange, Jay Z, and Beyoncé have chosen to keep their reconciliation behind closed doors. By releasing the statement, they have temporarily satisfied public curiosity, but more importantly, they have taken steps to protect themselves and their family from further harm caused by the constant tabloid speculation. With their unwavering support for each other, the Knowles-Carter family has proven that they are more than just a famous trio—they are a united front, resilient in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"1.

You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"She cooks food using sea water.\\" - Sentence B: \\"She cooks food using fresh water.\\"","output":"To determine which of these two sentences does not make sense, let's analyze each sentence and the context in which the water type is used for cooking food. Sentence A: \\"She cooks food using sea water.\\" Sea water, which can also be called seawater or saltwater, is water from oceans and seas. It contains a high concentration of dissolved salts, mostly sodium chloride (table salt). Using sea water to cook food is not a common practice mainly because of its high salt content, making the food extremely salty and potentially unpalatable. Additionally, consuming too much salt can be detrimental to one's health, as it might lead to high blood pressure and other related health issues. However, there are some specific instances where sea water can be used for cooking, such as boiling shellfish, seafood pasta, or even adding it as an ingredient in making bread. In these cases, the amount of sea water used is controlled, and the salt brings out the natural flavors of the ingredients. Also, sea water may be used in survival situations where freshwater sources are scarce, but it would require a careful balance between salt intake and water consumption, as drinking too much sea water can lead to dehydration and kidney problems. Sentence B: \\"She cooks food using fresh water.\\" Freshwater, on the other hand, is water with a low concentration of dissolved salts, making it ideal for human consumption and daily use, including cooking. Most commonly sourced from lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, freshwater is the standard for cooking, as it does not alter the taste of the food like saltwater would. Using fresh water for cooking is a widely accepted practice and makes sense within the context of preparing food for consumption. Based on the analysis, it is evident that Sentence A, \\"She cooks food using sea water,\\" makes less sense than Sentence B, when considering the general context and standard practice of cooking food. However, it is essential to note that there are exceptions in which using sea water for cooking could make sense, as mentioned above. Therefore, in general, Sentence A: \\"She cooks food using sea water\\" does not make as much sense as Sentence B: \\"She cooks food using fresh water,\\" when considering the context of cooking food."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the energy of motion called? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - binary energy - potential energy - mixed energy - kinetic energy A: A:","output":"The energy of motion is called kinetic energy. In the field of physics, energy is classified into various types based on their nature, usage, and manifestation. Kinetic energy is one of these various forms of energy. Kinetic energy is defined as the energy which an object possesses due to its motion. This means that any object that is moving has the ability to do work because it is in motion, and this ability is its kinetic energy. The word 'kinetic' itself originates from the Greek word ‘kinesis’ which means 'motion'. It's worth noting that the total amount of kinetic energy in a closed system is also called the kinetic energy of the system. The amount of kinetic energy something possesses depends on both its mass and its speed. Larger or faster objects have more kinetic energy. For example, a truck moving at a particular speed has more kinetic energy than a car moving at the same speed because the truck has more mass. Similarly, a fast-moving object has more kinetic energy than a slow-moving object of the same mass. To calculate the kinetic energy of an object, the equation used is KE = 1/2 mv^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the speed of the object. This equation shows that the kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to the square of its speed, which infers that if the speed of an object is doubled, its kinetic energy will increase four times. Furthermore, kinetic energy can be transferred from one object to another in the form of work. For instance, when a moving billiard ball hits another stationary ball, the kinetic energy from the first ball is transferred to the second ball, setting it into motion. Lastly, kinetic energy is different from the other types of energy listed. Binary energy is not a recognized form of energy in physics. Potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy that an object possesses due to its position or condition rather than motion. And, mixed energy is not a specific type of energy in itself, but a term possibly referring to a condition where various forms of energy are present together. Therefore, based on the choices provided - binary energy, potential energy, mixed energy, and kinetic energy - the correct answer to the question \\"What is the energy of motion called?\\" is kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Fresh vegetables at the produce market.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Fresh vegetables for sale in a grocery store.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.\\"?","output":"Here are three different types of questions that can test the comprehension of the students: 1. Understanding and Interpretation Question: What are the two principles central to Leibniz's philosophy as identified in the passage? Answer: The two principles central to Leibniz's philosophy are the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. 2. Critical Thinking Question: Leibniz argues against the absolutist position using thought experiments. Based on the passage, what does he aim to demonstrate through these experiments? Answer: Leibniz aims to demonstrate that there is a contradiction in assuming the existence of absolute location and velocity. 3. Context application question: Based on the passage, how does Leibniz use the Principle of Sufficient Reason in his argument? Answer: Leibniz uses the Principle of Sufficient Reason to argue that for every fact or event, there is an explanation for why it is the way it is and not otherwise. This helps him to argue against absolutist notions such as the existence of absolute location and velocity by stating that they cannot be the way they are without sufficient explanation.

Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. According to the U.S. Census Bureau report for 2000, there are 401,000 people who identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 141,000 people identified themselves as being \\"Native Hawaiian\\" alone. Another important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\`i State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\`i political stars Benjamin J. Cayetano, John D. Waihee III, and Jeremy Harris enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park). Besides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\`i used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\`i, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the Territory of Hawai\`i in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\`i as public lands in 1959. OHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\`i through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. Rice v. Cayetano--suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections--reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\`i, regardless of ethnicity.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did anything important happen?","output":"Yes, something important happened.

Context: Taylor allays Remy's fear of spiders with intensive exposure therapy. Step 1: Understand the goal of Taylor: In this context, Taylor's goal is to help Remy overcome the fear of spiders through exposure therapy. This is a therapeutic method in which someone is systematically exposed to the object of fear in a controlled and progressive manner in order to decrease their fear response. Step 2: Analyze each of the given options. A: Pleased with work - This option suggests that Taylor feels good about their work, specifically the successful therapy procedure they conducted to help Remy overcome their fear of spiders. Given the context, this is a possible emotion Taylor could be feeling. B: Proud to hurt Remy - This option implies that Taylor actively sought to hurt Remy, which goes against helping Remy.

One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In case A, would the group get less or more benefit as a whole than in case B? A:","output":"In case A, the group would likely receive more benefits as a whole than in case B. This is because living in a larger herd offers several advantages for the African Buffalo, which in turn benefits the entire group. Some of these advantages include: 1. Improved predator defense: A larger herd typically means enhanced safety from predators such as lions and hyenas. In a big group, there are more eyes and ears to detect threats, and the sheer number of individuals can intimidate or deter predators. If a predator does attack the group, there is strength in numbers, and the buffaloes are more likely to fend off the predator together. 2. Enhanced foraging opportunities: Although competition for resources like food and water might be higher in a larger herd, there are also benefits. A bigger group can cover more ground while grazing, which means that a larger herd will potentially have access to more diverse food sources than a smaller herd. This can improve the overall health and well-being of the entire group. 3. Social structure and support: A large herd offers a well-defined social structure, which can provide stability and support for the buffaloes. This can lead to improved reproductive success for the males as they can establish dominance in a bigger group, and females are more likely to find a suitable mate. Additionally, large herds can provide better protection for calves, increasing their chances of survival. 4. Effective communication and learning: Living in a large herd enables the buffaloes to learn from each other, particularly when it comes to finding new food sources or waterholes. They can also communicate more effectively about potential threats or other important information. 5. Genetic diversity: A larger herd typically offers greater genetic diversity, improving the overall genetic health of the group. This can lead to stronger immune systems and better adaptability, which ultimately contributes to the long-term survival of the entire group. In summary, although there may be some drawbacks, such as increased competition for resources, the benefits of living in a larger herd (case A) generally outweigh those of a smaller herd (case B) for African Buffaloes. This results in the group receiving more benefits as a whole in case A compared to case B."},{"instruction":"Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

While it is true that certain techniques and characteristics are synonymous with specific artists, it remains difficult to establish the definite artist behind an unsigned, previously unknown painting solely based on these aspects. Additionally, some artists might have imitators or followers who adopt their styles, and over time, an artist's style can evolve, making it even more challenging to pinpoint the creator.

Historian Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Sure, the information provided pertains to the early phase of the Korean War that took place in the 1950s, during which China became significantly involved. Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, issued a warning to the United States on 30th September (presumably 1950, the year the war started) that China would not hesitate to intervene in the war if US forces crossed the 38th parallel. The 38th parallel was the pre-war boundary between North and South Korea; thus, crossing this line would mean an invasion of North Korea, something that China was strongly opposed to as they were allies with North Korea. In addition to his warning, Zhou Enlai also tried to provide guidance to North Korean military commanders. He recommended they use the same tactics employed by Chinese communist forces to evade the Nationalist forces led by Chiang Kai-shek during the Encirclement Campaigns—a series of five campaigns launched against the communist Red Army during China's Civil War in the 1930s. However, the information provided suggests that North Korean commanders didn't effectively utilize these tactics. But historian Bruce Cumings argues otherwise. According to him, the rapid withdrawal of the Korean People's Army (North Korean army) was a strategic move. Rather than being a straightforward retreat, he contends that the North Korean troops dispersed into the mountains. From there, they could launch guerrilla strikes on the United Nations forces who were spread out along the coasts, therefore maintaining pressure and conflict even while in retreat."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who played pebbles in the 1994 flintstones movie??","output":"In the 1994 Flintstones movie, the character Pebbles, who is the cute little daughter of Fred and Wilma Flintstone, was played by a young actress named Elaine and Melanie Silver.

In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text. Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long. Text: this actually happened a few years back. so there i was, back from college on my winter break. i was doing absolutely nothing that day, just sitting on my lazy ass probably on reddit. my mom walks into the room and asks when i'm going to put all of her music on to her new iphone 4s. first off, she has no music on her itunes yet; she doesn't even have her own personal itunes thing either (i have all my songs on my itunes, so i had to make a separate one for her). so i tell her i'll do it later, like i always do. she says, \\"you always say that...\\" damn it, she caught on. so i start asking her what music she wants and she gives me this list of a bunch of artists/songs and i try my best to illegally download them. once i was done downloading most of them, i plugged her iphone 4s into my laptop. up came a notification asking if i wanted to sync \\"alc0tt's iphone.\\" i was confused for a second but i remembered that this was my old 4s that i gave to my mom and we never renamed it. so i click yes and i think everything's fine and dandy. it starts to sync, but it's taking way too long. i only downloaded like 50 songs, it shouldn't be taking this long, right? so i check to see what's happening and i realized that it was syncing all of *my* data into her phone. my 1500 songs, all my photos, contacts, text messages, everything. i unplugged the iphone but the damage has already been done. i dun' goofed. so i told my mom about my fuck up and she said she needs her contacts and stuff for tomorrow because she's expecting messages from work. this meant that we would have to go to the at&t store early in the morning on the way to her work. the at&t store opens at 9 and my mom has to be at work by 9... so she's understandably pissed. my mom wakes me up early the next morning and says we have to leave in a half hour or so to go to the at&t place. i nod, half asleep, and lay in bed for a while. she tells me we're leaving now and i put on some clothes and jet out the door to the car. so let me explain to you guys what the weather is like outside. it's winter. it's cold as fuck. it just started to snow a little and the forecast said that it was supposed to lightly snow for a few hours. now let me tell you guys about my moms car. it was a beautiful, white, 2003 mustang. we bought it from a guy on craigslist, but it worked really well and there were rarely any problems. one thing the guy did mention is that you should not drive it in the snow. it's a two-wheel drive car and is not good in the snow... *at all*... but it just started to snow so we thought that it won't be too bad. we just had to drive to the at&t store, which we pass anyway on the way to her work (25 min), and then drive back. not too bad. so we get into the car, my moms driving and i'm sitting in the passenger seat. she starts driving and she's going about 15 mph since she knows the car isn't good in the snow. slow and steady wins the race. the road seems pretty slippery but not *too* bad. we get to the at&t store no problem. they fix her phone and we're back on the road. things were going swell until my mom tries to stop very slowly at a red light, but the car keeps on keeping on. it slides until it is stopped by the curb (we were driving in the right lane). this scared the shit out of us. this same thing happened one or two more times, making us figuratively shit our pants. we make it to my moms work fine and she parks in front of her work. she tells me that i should probably call my dad to come pick me up or maybe take the bus since the roads are so slippery. me being the overconfident man that i am, i say that it's not a problem; i can make it back home. so i drive off. i drive very slowly and carefully because of these circumstances, but mother nature doesn't care how careful you are. there were two more times where i tried to slow down for about half the block in order to stop for a red light, but the car just keeps on moving even when my foot is on the brake. it's scary as fuck. so i'm about 5 minutes away from my house and i'm just about to taste sweet victory when i see the streetlight in front of me turn yellow. i was very close to the light so there was no way i would be able to stop in time for the light. btw, i know that this crossroad has a camera in order to give traffic tickets. so i step on the gas (not even that hard), but right as i do so, i lose all control of the car. the car starts to turn to the right so i try to correct it but the car was not having it. then, practically in slow motion, it heads straight for a tree on the sidewalk. the car jumps over the curb and goes head first into this tree. boom. the air bag hits me in the face and i'm stuck in shock for what it feels like an eternity. i run out to assess the damage and also to just get the fuck out of my car that can explode at any moment (that's what i thought in my scared as shit mind). but holy shit i forgot to turn the car off. so the car just keeps trying to go up this fucking tree. i run back into the car and take the keys out. it's finally over. so i call the police and my mom to tell them what happened. then as i wait, i practiced yelling \\"fuck\\" for about 10 minutes.","output":"A person accidentally synced all of their data to their mom's iPhone and had to visit the AT&T store in the snow to fix the issue.

Act 1: Retired New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) lives a peaceful life with his wife, Bonnie Bedelia, and their children in a quiet small town. For John's birthday, Bonnie surprises him with a trip to Europe to celebrate their love and enjoy a romantic vacation. As they stroll through the streets of Paris, they revel in the city's beauty and charm while reminiscing their action-packed past life. Act 2: The holiday takes a dark turn when a group of international criminals, led by the ruthless Ivan Kordakov (a former Eastern European mercenary), abducts Bonnie. John quickly learns that Ivan seeks revenge for John's role in foiling his past attempts to seize power through organized crime. Desperate to recover Bonnie, John taps into his extensive connections within the intelligence community to gather intel on Ivan's whereabouts. Act 3: As John uncovers more details about Ivan's past and his vendetta, he realizes that the only way to save Bonnie is to bring his old team back together and outsmart the enemy. Enlisting the help of a skilled hacker named Daisy (Millie Bobby Brown), an ex-Mossad agent named Eli (Idris Elba), and his former partner-turned-security consultant, Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), John embarks on a thrilling chase across Europe. Act 4: Along the way, the team encounters multiple obstacles, gunfights, narrow escapes, double-crosses, and life-threatening explosions. In a suspenseful race against time, John and his team discover that they are not the only ones looking for Ivan's gang; a mysterious organization wants them dead too. Unbeknownst to the team, Ivan's ultimate goal is to carry out a catastrophic terrorist attack in the heart of Europe, using Bonnie as leverage to force John to help them. Act 5: In a thrilling climax, John and his team infiltrate Ivan’s hideout while simultaneously attempting to disarm the explosives set to detonate throughout the city. As they face off with Ivan and his men, they uncover the real mastermind behind the entire conflict – a rogue intelligence agency director named Cora (Charlize Theron) who had manipulated events in an attempt to seize power and control over European governments. Left with no choice but to join forces with their mutual enemy, Ivan, John and his team manage to expose and neutralize Cora's network, preventing the terror attack and restoring order. In a tense standoff, John frees his wife Bonnie and apprehends Cora. In the heat of the moment, Ivan sacrifices himself to let John and Bonnie escape, showcasing that even those we view as enemies might still act with honor.

The movie ends with the McClanes' renewed appreciation for their life together and understanding that their unbreakable bond is what guided John through this harrowing ordeal.

President Donald Trump abruptly fired Comey May 9, 2017, dramatically ousting the nation's... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and FBI Director James Comey's firing (all times local): 12:25 p.m. Three U.S. officials say fired FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers that he asked the Justice Department for more money for the bureau's investigation into Russia's election meddling. President Donald Trump fired Comey Tuesday. The officials say Comey told lawmakers he had made the request to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department is denying that Comey asked for more resources. The White House has wielded a critical memo from Rosenstein to justify President Donald Trump's decision to fire Comey on Tuesday. Rosenstein's memo focused only on Comey's handling of last year's investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's email practices. It does not mention the Russia investigation. The officials were not authorized to disclose the meetings publicly and insisted on anonymity. -By Julie Pace and Eileen Sullivan __ 12:10 p.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (SEHR'-gay LAHV'-rahf) says it is \\"humiliating\\" for the American people to hear that Russia is controlling the political situation in the U.S. Lavrov is speaking at the Russian Embassy in Washington after meetings with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He said Wednesday that politicians raising questions about Russian interference in the election are damaging the U.S. political system by suggesting that it is being controlled externally. Lavrov is brushing off the questions as \\"noise\\" about Russians' contacts with people in Trump's campaign. He says through a translator that \\"there is not a single fact\\" or piece of compelling evidence proving Russia's intervention in the election. Lavrov is pointing out that Trump dismisses the controversy as \\"false news.\\" ___ 11:45 a.m. President Donald Trump says ousted FBI Director James Comey \\"was not doing a good job.\\" It was Trump's first public remarks about his firing Tuesday of the FBI chief. Trump briefly spoke to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday after a closed meeting with Russia's foreign minister. His remarks come as the White House is defending the decision to dismiss Comey. Administration officials have said the firing was not related to the investigation into possible contacts between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Trump was joined by Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state and national security adviser under President Richard Nixon. __ 11:20 a.m. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says there's no need for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's ties to the Trump campaign in the wake of the firing of the FBI director. GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina says his committee has the jurisdiction and responsibility to continue its Russia investigation and \\"we are going to do that.\\" However Burr reiterated questions about President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. \\"The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn't make sense to me.\\" And, Burr said that the firing \\"made our task a little more difficult but it didn't make it impossible so we'll continue.\\" Burr said he spoke to Trump but wouldn't detail the exchange. He said they didn't discuss his committee's investigation __ 11:12 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence is defending the firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying the \\"president made the right decision at the right time.\\" He said Comey's firing was not related to the investigation into possible contacts between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Pence says the administration is now looking forward to finding someone to lead the law enforcement agency. President Donald Trump fired Comey on Tuesday. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, criticized Comey's handling of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices. Pence says Comey had lost the confidence of the American people. He says Trump took \\"strong and decisive leadership\\" to put the safety and security of the American people first. __ 11:05 a.m. The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says President Donald Trump told her that he was firing FBI Director James Comey because \\"the department is a mess.\\" California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said she was surprised and taken aback after Trump called her and other senators to deliver the news shortly before the White House announced Comey's dismissal Tuesday. Feinstein says she questions the reasoning and timing behind Trump's decision and asked the GOP-led committee to bring in Justice Department officials to explain it. She said what \\"sticks in her mind\\" is a classified briefing Comey delivered in March in which he laid out counterintelligence and criminal investigations the FBI is conducting into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. She said it's clear \\"the FBI was taking its job seriously.\\" __ 10:45 a.m. The Senate's Russia investigators are asking the Treasury Department's criminal investigation division for any information relevant to President Donald Trump, his top aides and campaign officials. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN that the request is part of the panel's effort to \\"follow the intel no matter where it leads.\\" Warner's office confirmed the senator's comments. The Senate intelligence committee is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties between Trump associates and the Russian government. The House intelligence committee is conducting a parallel investigation. ___ 10:25 a.m. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Russia is not concerned about Comey's firing. When asked how Comey's sacking could influence Russia-U.S. ties, Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday: \\"This is the U.S. president's sovereign decision which does not have anything to do with Russia and should not have anything to do with Russia.\\" Russian state television network Rossiya 24 referred to President Richard Nixon's firing of independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. It said that \\"the story with Comey is different.\\" Comey, it said, \\"played a good cop and fell into a trap he had set for himself.\\" Senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov tweeted that Comey \\"kept an eye on the 'Russian threat' so hard that he did not notice the threat of his own sacking.\\" Another senior lawmaker, Konstantin Kosachev, rejected suggestions that Comey's sacking could have a Russian link. \\"The 'Russian trail' is hardly there and definitely could not have been the underlying cause for the firing of such a prominent player on the Washington scene,\\" Kosachev told the Interfax news agency. \\"Because this trail is merely a tool in the domestic political game and Trump's stakes are more than just about the Russia issue.\\" __ 10:20 a.m. A Justice Department official says Attorney General Jeff Sessions is interviewing candidates to serve as the interim replacement for fired FBI Director James Comey. Comey's deputy, FBI veteran Andrew McCabe, has become acting director after Comey was fired by President Donald Trump. But a Justice Department official says senior leaders are interviewing additional candidates who could do the job until a permanent replacement for Comey is named and confirmed by the Senate. An announcement about Comey's interim successor could come as soon as Wednesday. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the selection process by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. ___ 10 a.m. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is asking that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy appear before the Senate to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. The New York Democrat said Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should discuss why Sessions participated in the decision to fire Comey despite recusing himself and whether Rosenstein acted on his own when recommending Comey's dismissal or whether he was order to do so by the White House. Schumer also repeated his call for a special counsel to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and the Russian government. He also said the administration should answer why the president didn't wait until the Justice Department's inspector general issued a report on Comey's much-criticized actions regarding the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. ___ 9:50 a.m. Amid Democratic calls for a special prosecutor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says a new investigation of Russia meddling could only serve to impede the current probes underway. McConnell spoke on the Senate floor as Democratic senators gathered to try to pressure the GOP over President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. McConnell didn't give his own view on Trump's decision to fire Comey. But he noted that Democrats had repeatedly criticized Comey in the past, and had called for his removal. Following McConnell on the floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a special prosecutor. But McConnell said: \\"Today we'll no doubt hear calls for a new investigation which could only serve to impede the current work being done.\\" The Senate and House intelligence committees are investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election and Russian ties to the Trump campaign. ___ 9:40 a.m. Sen. Lindsey Graham says he doesn't believe a special prosecutor should be considered unless the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's possible connections to Russia becomes a criminal matter. It's now a counterintelligence investigation. The South Carolina Republican says if it becomes \\"a criminal investigation where the Trump campaign may be exposed to criminal charges, then that's the time to have that conversation.\\" Graham says he's confident the FBI's investigation won't be hampered by President Donald Trump's firing of the bureau's director, James Comey. ___ 9:30 a.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman says Moscow isn't concerned about the firing of the FBI director. Dmitry Peskov says Russia hopes that President Donald Trump's decision to fire the FBI's James Comey won't affect U.S.-Russia ties \\"in any way.\\" Peskov calls it \\"an entirely domestic matter\\" for the United States. ___ 9:10 a.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is reacting sarcastically to questions about President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were asked during a photo-op whether Comey's firing cast a shadow over the meeting between the two diplomats. Lavrov said: \\"Was he fired? You're kidding. You're kidding.\\" Then the Russian diplomat waved his hand dismissively and exited the room alongside Tillerson. The meeting comes amid growing concerns about Trump's decision to fire the head of the law enforcement agency investigating Russian interference in the U.S. election and possible collusion by Trump's campaign. Lavrov is scheduled to meet later Wednesday with Trump at the White House. __ 8:50 a.m. President Donald Trump is attacking Sen. Richard Blumenthal for criticizing his firing of FBI Director James Comey. The Connecticut Democrat appeared on MSNBC and CNN Wednesday morning. On CNN, Blumenthal said that the firing had prompted a \\"looming constitutional crisis.\\" Trump tweeted Wednesday that he was watching Blumenthal speak, calling it a \\"joke.\\" He criticized Blumenthal for past statements that he served in Vietnam, saying he \\"would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there.\\" Trump said that Blumenthal \\"cried like a baby\\" when caught and that he should be investigated. Trump has previously attacked Blumenthal over statements that he served in Vietnam. Blumenthal was in the Marine Corps Reserves at the time but did not fight in Vietnam. __ 7:40 a.m. President Donald Trump says that Republicans and Democrats will soon \\"be thanking me\\" for firing FBI Director James Comey. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning that Comey had \\"lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.\\" He added: \\"when things calm down, they will be thanking me!\\" Trump abruptly fired Comey Tuesday night. The surprise decision came amid the law enforcement agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. __ 7:24 a.m. President Donald Trump says fired FBI Director James Comey \\"will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.\\" In an early-morning tweet Wednesday, Trump attacked Democrats critical of his firing of Comey. Trump said that Democrats \\"have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\\" Trump abruptly fired Comey in the midst of the law enforcement agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. ___ 4:40 a.m. Amid the clamor surrounding the firing of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump singled out one another Washington fixture for his scorn. The president went to his Twitter account late Tuesday to chide Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, for comments the Democrat made about the stunning dismissal. Trump had telephoned Schumer earlier to inform him of the decision. Schumer said he told Trump that \\"you are making a big mistake.\\" Schumer also questioned why the firing occurred on Tuesday and wondered whether investigations into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia were \\"getting too close for the president.\\" He said unless a special prosecutor is named, Americans could rightfully wonder whether the move was \\"part of a cover-up.\\" Trump fired back with a tweet exclaiming: \\"Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant.\\" ___ 3:35 a.m. President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey throws into question the future of a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's possible connections to Russia. It immediately raised suspicions of an underhanded effort to stymie a probe that has shadowed the administration from the outset. Democrats likened the firing to President Richard Nixon's \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\" and renewed calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor, and some Republicans also questioned the move. In his letter to Comey, Trump said the firing was necessary to restore \\"public trust and confidence\\" in the FBI. The administration paired the letter with a scathing review by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of how Comey handled the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's email practices, including his decision to hold a news conference announcing its findings and releasing \\"derogatory information\\" about Clinton. __ 11:05 p.m. FBI Director James Comey was speaking to agents at the FBI's field office in Los Angeles when the news of his firing broke. That's according to a law enforcement official who was present at the time Tuesday. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to discuss the situation publicly. The official says television screens in the field office began flashing the news, and Comey initially chuckled. But he continued to speak to the agents, finishing his speech before heading into an office. He did not reappear in the main room. Comey later left Los Angeles on a plane to return to Washington. —By Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles ||||| With a lot of the speculation that the firing of James Comey was about more than his handling of the Clinton e-mail scandal, here is more news that won’t look good: Breaking News: Days before his firing, Comey asked the Justice Dept. for more money for the FBI inquiry into Russia https://t.co/K33pJO300n — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 10, 2017 Days before he was fired, James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, asked the Justice Department for a significant increase in money and personnel for the bureau’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the presidential election, according to three officials with knowledge of his request. Mr. Comey asked for the resources during a meeting last week with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who wrote the Justice Department’s memo that was used to justify the firing of the F.B.I. director this week. Again, that Comey was fired because of the Russia probe instead of the Clinton scandal is just speculation. However, with a media that is not friendly to the Trump Administration, and with the number of leaks this administration has produced, the best case scenario is that Trump’s timing was bad. UPDATED: The Department of Justice has denied the claim. ||||| President Donald Trump weighed firing his FBI director for more than a week. When he finally pulled the trigger Tuesday afternoon, he didn’t call James Comey. He sent his longtime private security guard to deliver the termination letter in a manila folder to FBI headquarters. He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said. Story Continued Below Trump’s firing of the high-profile FBI director on the 110th day after the president took office marked another sudden turn for an administration that has fired its acting attorney general, national security adviser and now its FBI director, whom Trump had praised until recent weeks and even blew a kiss to during a January appearance. The news stunned Comey, who saw news of his dismissal on TV while speaking inside the FBI office in Los Angeles. It startled all but the uppermost ring of White House advisers, who said grumbling about Comey hadn’t dominated their own morning senior staff meetings. Other top officials learned just before it happened and were unaware Trump was considering firing Comey. “Nobody really knew,” one senior White House official said. “Our phones all buzzed and people said, ‘What?’” By ousting the FBI director investigating his campaign and associates, Trump may have added more fuel to the fire he is furiously trying to contain — and he was quickly criticized by a chorus of Republicans and Democrats. “The timing of this firing was very troubling,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

Trump had grown angry with the Russia investigation — particularly Comey admitting in front of the Senate that the FBI was investigating his campaign — and that the FBI director wouldn’t support his claims that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones in Trump Tower. Bipartisan criticism of Comey had mounted since last summer after the director delivered a lengthy statement outlining why no charges would be brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. But the fallout seemed to take the White House by surprise. Trump made a round of calls around 5 p.m., asking for support from senators. White House officials believed it would be a “win-win” because Republicans and Democrats alike had had problems with the FBI director, one person briefed on the administration’s deliberations said. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told him he was making a big mistake — and Trump seemed “taken aback,” according to a person familiar with the call. By Tuesday evening, the president was watching the coverage of his decision and frustrated no one was on TV defending him, a White House official said. He wanted surrogates out there beating the drum. Instead, advisers were attacking one another for not realizing the gravity of the situation as events blew up. “How are you not defending your position for three solid hours on TV?” the White House aide asked. Two White House officials said there was little communications strategy in handling the firing, and that staffers were given talking points late Tuesday for hastily arranged media appearances. Aides soon circulated previous quotes from Schumer hitting Comey. After Schumer called for a special prosecutor, the White House huddled in press secretary Sean Spicer’s office to devise a strategy and sent “fresh faces” to TV, one White House official said. By Tuesday night, aides were using TV appearances to spin the firing as a simple bureaucratic matter and call for an end to the investigation. “It’s time to move on,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said on Fox News. In his letter dismissing Comey, Trump said the FBI director had given him three private assurances that he wasn’t under investigation. The White House declined to say when those conversations happened — or why Comey would volunteer such information. It is not the first time Trump has publicly commented on an ongoing investigation — typically a no-no for presidents. He said earlier this month that Comey had done Clinton a favor by letting her off easy. Trump received letters from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, calling for Comey’s dismissal, on Tuesday, a spokesman said. The president then decided to fire the FBI director based on the recommendations and moved quickly. The spokesman said Trump did not ask for the letters in advance, and that White House officials had no idea they were coming. But several other people familiar with the events said Trump had talked about the firing for more than a week, and the letters were written to give him a rationale for firing Comey. The decision marked a turnabout for Trump. On the campaign trail, the candidate led chants of “Lock her up!” and praised Comey’s “guts” in October for reopening the probe into her email server. He joked openly with Comey at the White House two days after the inauguration. Trump, one White House official said, believed Comey was too soft on Clinton — not too unfair, as Rosenstein’s letter Tuesday indicated. At FBI headquarters, one senior official said the bureau was essentially in lockdown, not answering calls flooding in and referring all questions to the Justice Department. “I got nothing for you. Sorry,” said the official. “We were caught totally off guard. But we are not commenting in any kind of way, and referring calls to DOJ.” Comey had flown on an FBI plane to Los Angeles for a “diversity and recruiting” event. Trump’s director of Oval Office operations, longtime security aide Keith Schiller, hand-delivered the dismissal letter to FBI headquarters. By Tuesday evening, the shock that had spread throughout the ranks of current and former FBI officials was mixed with a growing sense of anger among the many Comey loyalists, and demands for answers as to why the director had been fired — and why now. “We just have no idea why this happened. No idea,” said one recently retired top FBI official who worked closely with Comey on many high-profile investigations. “No one knew this was coming. Everyone is just shocked that this happened.” There was no immediate front-runner for the vacancy, one White House official said. “If there’s a list, I haven’t seen it,” said one senior White House official. While shock dominated much of the FBI and the White House, the mood at Roger Stone’s house in Florida was one of elation. Several Stone allies and friends said Stone, a Trump associate who has been frequently mentioned in the investigation, encouraged the president to fire Comey in conversations in recent weeks. On Twitter, Stone signaled praise for the move by posting an image of Trump from “The Apprentice” saying, “You’re fired.” Stone declined to comment Tuesday night but said he was enjoying a fine cigar. Josh Meyer, Tara Palmeri and Annie Karni contributed to this report. ||||| Before President Donald Trump abruptly fired him on Tuesday, former FBI Director James Comey had requested additional funding and staffing for the agency’s investigation into Russia’s influence on the 2016 election, multiple sources reported Wednesday. This news provides a possible explanation for the timing of Trump’s stunning decision. Comey met last week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, after the Senate Intelligence Committee had asked the FBI director to accelerate the bureau’s investigation. Rosenstein wrote a memo that provided Trump’s reasoning for firing Comey on Tuesday night, titled “Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI.” Rosenstein wrote that he had recommended Comey be fired because the director “made serious mistakes” in how he handled Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s private emails. Sarah Isgur Flores, the Justice Department’s top spokeswoman, told HuffPost that the reports regarding Comey asking for more money were “totally false.” Trump did not offer an explanation for Comey’s sudden dismissal, telling reporters on Wednesday that he’d fired the director simply “because he was not doing a good job.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Days before he was fired as FBI director, James Comey requested more money and personnel for the agency's investigation into alleged links between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, according to unnamed sources cited in media reports. Comey had asked for increased resources from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who later wrote the memo on which Trump based Comey's dismissal. The White House insisted that Comey's firing was unrelated to that investigation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Water is heated - The heated water evaporates - The salt is left behind - The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The evaporated water is collected - The process is repeated - More salt is removed from the water. suppose a smaller amount of water is evaporated happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.

Attempts by some of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule failed, and Persia invaded the states of mainland Greece in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. A second invasion by the Persians followed in 480 BC. Despite a heroic resistance at Thermopylae by Spartans and other Greeks led by King Leonidas, and a simultaneous naval engagement at Artemisium,[page needed] Persian forces occupied Athens, which had been evacuated in time, as well as briefly overrunning half of Greece. Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale, the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time, marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their European territories. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greek victories in the Greco-Persian Wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history, as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Q: Problem: if the difference between the length and breadth of a rectangle is 23 m and its perimeter is 266 m , what is its area ? A:","output":"The task here is asking us to find the area of a rectangle given the conditions: 1. The difference between the length and the breadth of the rectangle is 23 meters. 2. The rectangle's perimeter is 266 meters. The guidelines to approach this problem anticipate the application of the formulas that are usually associated with a rectangle, mainly the formulas for its perimeter and area. To find the solution, we must follow these steps: Step 1: Let's set up variables for what we know from the problem. We know that the difference between the length (L) and the breadth (W) of the rectangle is 23 meters, so we can express that as: L - W = 23 (equation 1) Step 2: We also know that the perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 266 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2L + 2W. We can express that as: 2L + 2W = 266 (equation 2) Step 3: Rewrite the equations to align with the same variable: Equation 1 can be written as L = W + 23. Step 4: Substitute this value from Equation 1 into Equation 2: 2(W + 23) + 2W = 266, 2W + 46 + 2W = 266, 4W + 46 = 266, 4W = 220, W = 55. Step 5: Substitute W= 55 into Equation 1 to find the value of L: L = 55 + 23 = 78 Step 6: Now that we have found the length (L) and breadth (W), use them to find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula, A = L*W. A = 78 * 55, A = 4290 m² That's it! The area of the rectangle is 4290 m²."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. Which person observed a loss in genetic diversity? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Question: Where the tournament has come? Movie plot title: The Tournament Movie plot: A series of TV news reports are shown about acts of violence across the globe; gunfights, shootings, explosions, terrorist attacks, and other acts of murder, both small and larger scale. In some of these reports, the newscasters say that authorities are dismissing some of the random explosions as accidental. A voiceover by a man named Powers (Liam Cunningham) says that not everything is as it appears. Every seven years an extraordinary event takes place in an ordinary town, and every-day people won't see it or otherwise know about it... but it happens.Shirao, Brazil, seven years prior to the present. Blood drips off of a meat hook in a burning warehouse, and there is the distant sound of machine gun fire. Joshua Harlow (Ving Rhames) ducks for cover, finding his revolver empty. Off to one side, another man lies wounded, also out of ammunition. The wounded man asks Joshua, 'Don't let it be him.'Joshua checks a mobile device and sees a display with one dot in the center, and another dot rapidly approaching the centered one. Gene Walker (John Lynch), a long-haired man with an automatic rifle arrives on the scene, taunting Joshua and opening fire. He sprays the area with bullets, further wounding the wounded man. Joshua manages to hit a button that causes the meat hooks, some still with large slabs of meat on them, to begin moving, providing him some cover as he runs. A closed-circuit TV camera (CCTV) is shown in one corner of the ceiling as Joshua runs into another room; the armed man following. Walker calls Joshua a 'stain' on their 'profession' and invites him to see the only way to quit.Joshua sees a discarded shotgun near where Walker is standing. Creating a distraction, he runs, leaps and slides across the blood-slick floor as Walker hurries to load a new magazine into his rifle. Grabbing the shotgun and pressing it right up against Walker's nose and mouth, Joshua pulls the trigger and Walker's head is turned into a gory mess. On the mobile device, one of two adjacent dots on the display, disappears.Joshua...

Title: Nurse Betty Movie plot: In a small Kansas town, Betty (RenÃ©e Zellweger), a kind and considerate diner waitress, is a fan of the soap opera A Reason to Love. She has no idea that her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty to pursue a relationship with her. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership. When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car, as the LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Betty's husband into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse. That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince), local reporter Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover), and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she gets into her car and drives off. Betty's next stop is a bar in Arizona, where the lady bartender talks about her inspiring vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from A Reason to Love â not the actor who portrays him). Meanwhile, the two hitmen are trying to find her, as they have finally realized that she must have the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie begins falling in love with...

Assuming that: Increasing air temperature decreases atmospheric pressure. Answer:","output":"Given that increasing air temperature decreases atmospheric pressure, during a heat wave, when the air temperature rises, it is likely that the atmospheric pressure will decrease. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. A heat wave implies a significant increase in air temperature. 2. The assumption states that increasing air temperature decreases atmospheric pressure. 3. Therefore, during a heat wave, with the air temperature rising, the atmospheric pressure is likely to decrease.
