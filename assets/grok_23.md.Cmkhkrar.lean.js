First, we look at the unit's digit (ones place) of each integer. 2. If the unit's digit is 5 or greater, we round up, meaning we add the difference between the unit's digit and 10 to the original number, to reach the nearest multiple of 10. 3. If the unit's digit is less than 5, we round down, meaning we subtract the unit's digit from the original number to reach the nearest multiple of 10. Let's apply these rules to the given list of integers: [727, -548, 717, -509, -713]. For 727:  - Unit's digit = 7 (greater than 5) - Round up by adding 3 (10 - 7) - New number = 730 For -548:  - Unit's digit = 8 (greater than 5) - Round up by adding 2 (10 - 8) - New number = -540 (For negative numbers, rounding up means adding the value to make it less negative) For 717: - Unit's digit = 7 (greater than 5) - Round up by adding 3 (10 - 7) - New number = 720 For -509: - Unit's digit = 9 (greater than 5) - Round up by adding 1 (10 - 9) - New number = -500 (For negative numbers, rounding up means adding the value to make it less negative) For -713: - Unit's digit = 3 (less than 5) - Round down by subtracting 3 - New number = -710 So the rounded list of integers is [730, -540, 720, -500, -710]."},{"instruction":"Select from the following. --compete. --be the best. --lose.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\",  answer the following question.

Answer: Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is a vibrant and culturally rich city with a long and fascinating history. Nestled in the Kathmandu valley, the city serves as the economic, political, and cultural center of the country. Steeped in a rich history that dates back to the first millennium BC, Kathmandu boasts an extensive list of world heritage sites, cultural attractions, and tourism activities that enthrall visitors from around the world. Historically, the city was originally established as a confederation of three ancient kingdoms – Kantipur, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur – which date back to the Lichavi period in the 4th century AD. Throughout its long history, Kathmandu has been ruled by different dynasties, such as the Malla and Shah, each of which has left a significant mark on the city's architecture and cultural diversity. The architecture in Kathmandu is an amalgamation of Hindu, Buddhist, and Newari influences and is characterized by intricately carved wood, brick, and stone structures. The city has been a significant center for both Hinduism and Buddhism and boasts numerous temples, monasteries, and religious sites. Kathmandu's culture is a rich fusion of its multiethnic and multicultural identity. The Newari people are the indigenous inhabitants of the city, and their art, music, dance, and cuisine continue to play a prominent role in the overall culture of Kathmandu. Festivals are an integral aspect of the city's social and religious life, with some of the most notable ones being Dashain, Tihar, and Holi, which are celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm by locals and tourists alike. Tourism activities in Kathmandu cater to a wide range of interests, from history buffs to adventure seekers. Some of the must-see attractions in the city include: 1. Durbar Square: Located in the heart of Kathmandu, Durbar Square is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to some of the most stunning examples of Nepali architecture, such as the Hanuman Dhoka palace complex and the Kumari Bahal (House of the Living Goddess). 2. Swayambhunath Stupa: Also known as the Monkey Temple, this ancient religious complex sits atop a hill overlooking the city and is considered one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal. 3. Pashupatinath Temple: Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this sacred Hindu temple is situated along the banks of the Bagmati River. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts pilgrims and tourists from all over the world. 4. Boudhanath Stupa: This magnificent Buddhist stupa, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the largest in the world and is a popular destination for both tourists and Buddhist pilgrims. Adventure activities such as trekking, mountaineering, and paragliding can also be easily accessed from Kathmandu, with the city serving as a gateway to the numerous trekking routes of the majestic Himalayas. Additionally, visitors can indulge in local market tours, food walks, or simply spend time exploring the city's narrow streets and hidden alleys, which often lead to beautifully preserved courtyards.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. cellular respiration is when a cell converts from oxygen and carbohydrates into carbon dioxide, water, and energy A cell taking oxygen and carbs and making it into something else, which can be used more efficiently is  A). ridiculous B). respiration C). breathing D). retirement","output":"Cellular respiration is a critical process that occurs within cells, allowing them to efficiently convert molecules and nutrients, like oxygen and carbohydrates, into usable energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. The correct answer to the given question is B). Respiration. To provide a more detailed understanding, cellular respiration can be divided into four distinct stages: glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (which includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis). 1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell, where one glucose molecule (a carbohydrate) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a net production of two ATP molecules and two molecules of NADH, a high-energy electron carrier. Glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) and serves as the starting point for cellular respiration. 2. Pyruvate Oxidation: If oxygen is present, pyruvate molecules enter the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells or remain in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells to undergo further breakdown. During this process, each pyruvate molecule is converted into Acetyl CoA, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) and generating an additional NADH molecule. Acetyl CoA then enters the citric acid cycle. 3. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle or TCA Cycle): This cyclic process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix (in eukaryotes) or the cytoplasm (in prokaryotes). Acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon compound, to form citrate, a six-carbon compound. As citrate goes through a series of redox reactions, high-energy electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) are created, and two molecules of CO2 are released. For each Acetyl CoA that enters the cycle, one ATP molecule is produced. 4. Oxidative Phosphorylation: This stage involves the electron transport chain, which is a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (in eukaryotes) or plasma membrane (in prokaryotes). The high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 are transferred along the chain, releasing energy that drives the active transport of protons (H+ ions) across the membrane. This generates an electrochemical gradient, and the protons flow back into their original compartment (down the gradient) through an enzyme called ATP synthase. This process, called chemiosmosis, leads to the production of most ATP generated during cellular respiration (approximately 32 to 34 ATP molecules). In summary, cellular respiration is an essential process that allows cells to generate ATP efficiently, supporting various cellular functions and activities. The answer to the given question is B). Respiration."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

There might be people who will cycle just to get a free meal, but generally I don't think people will take advantage of our programme,\\" Copenhagen has a long-standing cycling tradition and 36% of locals cycle to work each day, one of the highest percentages in the world, according to the website visitcopenhagen.dk. US environmental website treehugger.com recently voted Copenhagen the world's best city for cyclists. \\"Because Copenhagen is strongly connected with cycling, we felt the bicycle would work well as a symbol of the hotel's green profile  .\\" If successful, the electric bicycle meal programme will be spread to all Crowne Plaza hotels in the UK, the hotel said in a statement. Question: How can a participant get a free meal? Yes or no, is the answer \\"By cycling to produce some electricity.\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer is by cycling to produce some electricity. A participant can get a free meal by producing at least 10 watt-hours of electricity using an exercise bike linked to a generator provided by the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Copenhagen. This typically takes around 15 minutes of cycling for someone of average fitness. Once they have produced 10 watt-hours of electricity, guests will be given meal tickets worth 36."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He is frequently ridiculed by everyone around him, except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo, and his co-worker and best friend Charlie Schumaker. Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell, owner of the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his boss Niko. One day, Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank. Stanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. After being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a wooden mask near the city's harbor. Placing it on his face transforms him into a zoot-suited, green-faced, bizarre trickster known as the Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. Stanley scares off a street gang that attempts to rob him by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun, and then he exacts revenge on his tormentors; he scares his grouchy landlady, and injures the con-artist repairmen who did unnecessary work on his car and charged him for it. The next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Kellaway and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt investigating the Mask's activity of the previous night. To attend Tina's performance, he again becomes the Mask to raid the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's plan in the process. At the Coco Bongo, Stanley dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing. Following a confrontation with Tyrell for disrupting the bank robbery, Stanley flees leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit that transforms back into his pajamas, while Tyrell is arrested by the police as a suspect for the bank robbery.

Examine the words and their connotations:    - \\"devoid\\" suggests a lack or absence of something, carrying a negative connotation.    - \\"artifice\\" refers to deceit or insincerity, typically with a negative connotation.    - \\"purpose\\" implies a goal or reason for existence, with a positive connotation when present, and a negative connotation when absent. 2. Analyze the sentiment of the sentence:    - The phrase \\"so devoid of\\" intensifies the absence of the qualities mentioned in the sentence.    - The absence of \\"artifice\\" may be viewed as a good thing, suggesting a sense of sincerity or authenticity.    - The absence of \\"purpose\\" is generally considered negative, as it implies a lack of meaning or direction. 3. Determine the overall sentiment:    - There's a mixture of sentiments here. The sentence conveys a sense of authenticity (a positive sentiment) by stating the absence of artifice. However, the lack of purpose introduces negativity to the sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"so devoid of artifice and purpose\\" could be perceived as mixed or neutral, with a hint of negativity due to the lack of purpose. The authentic aspect of the sentence may be viewed positively, but the absence of purpose suggests that some negative sentiments may overshadow the positive ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.  - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.  - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude>  - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services.  - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants.  - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America.  - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin.  - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.  - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants. Postal codes in the Borgne Arrondissement start with the number 15.  - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world.  - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing.  - An economy (From Greek   \\"household\\" and o  \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole.  - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America).  - Borgne ( Haitian Creole : Obòy ) is a commune in the north coast of Haiti , west of Cap - Haïtien and northwest of Limbé , in Nord Department . The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery . Other nearby places include Port - Margot , Robin , and Fond La Grange . Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \`\` sister cities '' relationship with Honeoye Falls , New York , United States . Satellite view of Borgne  - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.   - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.   - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism.  - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti. A hospital is located there. The hospital is run by the Alyans Sante Borgne, a partnership between the nongovernmental organization H.O.P.E. (Haiti Outreach Pwoje Espwa, based in Rochester New York) and the Haitian government's ministry of public health (MSPP).  - Borgne is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord department of Haiti. The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery. Other nearby places include Port-Margot, Robin, and Fond La Grange. Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \\"sister cities\\" relationship with Honeoye Falls, New York, United States.  - Established in 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purposes are to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes.

Question: Where is a Pterosaur shot? Movie title: Lost Continent Movie plot: Maj. Joe Nolan (Cesar Romero) is the head of an expedition to the South Pacific to retrieve an atomic-powered rocket that vanished without a trace. He had previously lived in a South American jungle, as has fellow serviceman and pilot Lt. Danny Wilson (Chick Chandler), who is also on the expedition. Aircraft mechanic Sgt. William Tatlow (Sid Melton) is also recruited for the expedition, which includes the three scientists who helped build the rocket. Their transport aircraft mysteriously crash-lands on a remote, unknown tropical island in the area where the rocket was lost on radar. They find only two occupants left on the island, a native woman (Acquanetta) and her young brother. The woman indicates something fell from the sky atop a forbidding, cloud-shrouded plateau that dominates part of the island. The rocket's fiery arrival caused the rest of the native population to abandon the island. Expedition member Stanley Briggs (Whit Bissell) is accidentally killed on the steep ascent of the escarpment. After long stretches of tedious rock climbing, the expedition finally closes in on the top. Emerging from what turns out to be a toxic gas cloud cover, they discover a lush, prehistoric jungle inhabited by various dinosaurs and a large field of uranium, which is what has disabled their electronic tracking equipment. The group comes upon a Brontosaurus, which then attacks Robert Phillips (Hugh Beaumont) as he quickly retreats up a tree. This results in Nolan and Wilson shooting at it, but they quickly discover that the dinosaur's thick hide absorbs bullets with little effect. Later that night they set up camp. When Nolan wakes up, he finds Phillips and Russian scientist Michael Rostov (John Hoyt) gone. He then discovers that Rostov got himself stuck in a large rock near a Triceratops; he accuses Phillips of arranging the accident on purpose, but Rostov insists that he tried to help Phillips escape.

Like adult dogs, puppies need daily walks, but they should not be walked for long periods. Every day, walk the puppy for about five minutes for every month of age.","output":"Step 1: Identify the puppy's age To determine the appropriate length of daily walks, first establish the puppy's age. For instance, if a puppy is three months old, they would require a 15-minute walk (3 months x 5 minutes = 15 minutes). Step 2: Plan the walks Plan the walks around the daily schedule to ensure consistency. Ideally, walking the puppy around the same time every day will create a routine, which is beneficial to both the puppy and the owner. Consistent walks can help prevent anxiety and keep the puppy well-behaved. Step 3: Choose a safe and appropriate environment for walks Select a safe place for the walks where the puppy can explore and socialize without danger. This environment should be free of hazards and ideally provide opportunities for the puppy to interact with other dogs or new experiences. Step 4: Use a suitable leash and harness When walking a puppy, use the appropriate leash and harness to ensure their safety. A harness helps distribute the force more evenly across the body, reducing the risk of injury. Additionally, it provides better control over the puppy's movements. Step 5: Provide positive reinforcement during walks Positive reinforcement is crucial to help the puppy learn good behavior during walks. Praise them for walking calmly and keep distractions at a minimum. Be patient as puppies can be easily distracted or excited while walking. Step 6: Monitor the puppy's energy and signs of fatigue Keep an eye on the puppy's energy levels and look for signs they may be getting tired. As they grow, their stamina will increase, but it's important not to over-exert them in the beginning. Adjust the duration and frequency of walks as needed to suit their changing energy levels. Step 7: Incorporate basic obedience training during walks Once the puppy has become accustomed to walking on a leash, it's a good idea to begin working on basic obedience training during walks. This can include simple commands like sit, stay, and come. By following these steps, the puppy will receive the appropriate amount of exercise for their age while also preventing boredom and any potential destructive behaviors. Consistent, well-planned walks help keep puppies both physically and mentally engaged, contributing to their overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One study in small animals showed that intraneural injection may be associated with higher injection pressures. However, the pressure heralding an intraneural injection and the clinical consequences of such injections remain controversial. Our hypothesis is that an intraneural injection is associated with higher pressures and an increase in the risk of neurologic injury as compared with perineural injection.', 'Seven dogs of mixed breed (15-18 kg) were studied. After general endotracheal anesthesia, the sciatic nerves were exposed bilaterally. Under direct microscopic guidance, a 25-gauge needle was placed either perineurally (into the epineurium) or intraneurally (within the perineurium), and 4 mL of lidocaine 2% (1:250,000 epinephrine) was injected by using an automated infusion pump (4 mL/min). Injection pressure data were acquired by using an in-line manometer coupled to a computer via an analog digital conversion board. After injection, the animals were awakened and subjected to serial neurologic examinations. On the 7th day, the dogs were killed, the sciatic nerves were excised, and histologic examination was performed by pathologists blinded to the purpose of the study.', 'Whereas all perineural injections resulted in pressures < or =4 psi, the majority of intraneural injections were associated with high pressures (25-45 psi) at the beginning of the injection. Normal motor function returned 3 hours after all injections associated with low injection pressures (< or =11 psi), whereas persistent motor deficits were observed in all 4 animals having high injection pressures (> or =25 psi).

Article: This will appear next to all of your comments      This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump proclaimed Thursday he was withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord , a sweeping step that fulfills a campaign promise while acutely dampening global efforts to curb global warming.      Speaking from the White House, Trump said he was open to renegotiating aspects of the agreement, which was inked under his predecessor and which all nations except two have signed onto.      But he was withering in his criticism of the pact, which he cast as a humiliating defeat for American workers that unfairly advantaged foreign countries.      \\"At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?\\" Trump inquired during an afternoon event held in a sun-drenched Rose Garden.      \\"We want fair treatment,\\" Trump said. \\"We don't want other countries and other leaders to laugh at us anymore.\\"      The decision amounts to a rebuttal of the worldwide effort to pressure Trump to remain a part of the agreement, which 195 nations signed onto. Foreign leaders, business executives and Trump's own daughter, Ivanka, lobbied heavily for him to remain a part of the deal, but ultimately lost out to conservatives who claim the plan is bad for the United States.      Trump, who has governed with an \\"American First\\" policy, said Thursday he was carrying out the will of the voters who propelled him to the White House.      \\"I was elected by the citizens of Pittsburgh,\\" Trump said, \\"not Paris.\\"      JUST WATCHED White House: Trump ditching Paris climate deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House: Trump ditching Paris climate deal 01:38      Lengthy process      In triggering the official withdrawal procedures, Trump has sparked a lengthy process that won't conclude until November 2020 -- the same month he's up for reelection, ensuring the issue becomes a major topic of debate in the next presidential contest.      In his remarks, Trump said he was open to re-brokering US carbon reduction commitments, but didn't express any urgency in bringing the US back into the deal, which he claimed placed \\"draconian\\" financial burdens on the American people.      \\"We're getting out,\\" he said. \\"And we will start to renegotiate and we'll see if there's a better deal. If we can, great. If we can't, that's fine.\\"      Afterward, the leaders of France, Italy and Germany indicated in a joint statement that the US could not unilaterally renegotiate the agreement. The UN body that facilitated the deal said it \\"cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single party.\\"      Briefing reporters, White House officials would not specify what parameters would be acceptable to Trump in a new accord.      \\"When we talk about what a better deal looks like, that's up to the President,\\" said one White House aide.      Trump said his announcement would end the implementation of carbon reduction targets set under Obama, which aimed to reduce emissions by 26-28% in a decade. Trump also declared the US would stall all contributions to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund, which Trump said was \\"costing the United States a fortune.\\"      \\"As someone who cares deeply about our environment, I cannot in good conscience support a deal which punishes the United States,\\" he said. \\"The Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.\\"      The President campaigned ardently against the climate agreement last year as a candidate, vowing to \\"cancel\\" the accord. Those close to him said he was insistent upon fulfilling his promises, despite urging from some members of his own administration to remain in the agreement.      A person familiar with Trump's thinking said the President was convinced he needed to withdraw from the pact, and there was little chance of talking him out of it.      Opponents of the move say it threatens to isolate the United States in a global effort to curb the warming of the planet, and leaves an opening for countries like China to fill the leadership void.      Uncertainty loomed      Trump's announcement Thursday ends months of speculation about his intentions. The uncertainty over Trump's decision lent the Rose Garden announcement a reality show-like air, with Thursday's unveiling acting as a finale to a months-long debate that has split members of the President's inner circle and led to deep consternation from global allies.      The show-like atmosphere was fueled by the presence of a jazz band, which performed a series of numbers before Trump emerged from the Oval Office to deliver his statement.      The announcement concluded a long and bitter dispute among West Wing aides to sway Trump's thinking. Ivanka Trump had worked to ensure her father heard pro-Paris voices over the last several months, and even in recent days continued to press for a decision short of a full withdrawal.      Ivanka Trump and her allies, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump's chief economist Gary Cohn, pressed Trump to alter the US commitments to the Paris agreement without fully pulling out of the accord. Trump was also pressured heavily by his foreign counterparts during last week's G7 meetings in Sicily to remain in the deal, though his advisers say he felt little obligation to concede to that point of view.      In the end, anti-Paris voices, led by chief strategist Steve Bannon and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, won out, and Trump's remarks Thursday reflected the nationalist viewpoints espoused by Bannon and his cohorts.      \\"This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,\\" Trump said.      Bannon was seated in the front row of the audience during Trump's remarks, while Pruitt delivered a statement himself after Trump spoke. Ivanka Trump wasn't not present for the announcement; aides said she was at home celebrating the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

In a rare statement about current political events, former President Barack Obama, whose administration negotiated the Paris accord, wrote Trump's decision would leave American workers behind those in countries who remain a part of the agreement.      \\"The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,\\" Obama wrote. \\"I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up.\\"      And multiple foreign leaders decried the decision, including in phone calls directly with Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Trump his was disappointed in his decision, according to a statement from his office. French President Emmanuel Macron informed Trump that the Paris accord could not be negotiated, the Élysée Palace said.      Meanwhile, China, the world's largest carbon emitter, has said it will stick by its commitments to the Paris agreement, despite the US moves. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"On June 1, 2017, President Donald Trump declared that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Addressing the nation from the White House, the President reasoned that the environmental accord placed unfair financial and economic burdens on American workers and would result in job losses. He stated that the goal was to negotiate a better deal that would not put the U.S. at a disadvantage. Trump's decision was largely criticized worldwide, and his critics cited it as a disappointing retreat from U.S. leadership in global climate efforts. Notably, the decision faced opposition from multiple sectors, including foreign governments, business executives, and some members in the President's inner circle, such as his daughter, Ivanka Trump. Despite significant lobbying efforts to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement, Trump's decision was influenced mainly by conservative voices arguing the agreement was detrimental to the United States. The leaders of several countries, including France, Italy, and Germany, indicated in response to Trump's withdrawal that the Paris Agreement could not simply be renegotiated to suit one party's interests. Former President Barack Obama also voiced his apprehension, stating that Trump's decision meant the U.S. was giving up its leadership role and disadvantaging its workers. The formal withdrawal process initiated by President Trump would take a few years, not concluding until November 2020. This timeline ensured that the issue of climate change and the U.S.'s standing in international agreements would remain a significant topic of contention in the upcoming presidential election. Although the federal government decided to pull out of the Paris Agreement, many states, cities, and businesses across the U.S. committed to uphold the goals outlined by the climate accord. Similarly, China, the world's largest carbon emitter, pledged to stick by its commitments to the Paris agreement despite the U.S.'s withdrawal. In summary, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was met with substantial domestic and international criticism, as it was seen as a renouncement of global environmental responsibility and U.S. leadership. Notwithstanding, the situation further ignited climate action at different levels of society, both in the U.S. and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

As the group collaborates, other park-goers start to take notice of the commotion and begin to gather around. This draws the attention of a man seated on a nearby bench, who appears to have a large supply of additional freebies. He approaches the lady and the passersby, offering to replenish their stock as they continue with their impromptu event. Grateful for the extra assistance, the lady collects more freebies, promptly distributing them to her newfound helpers.

A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter.

If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating.

The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \\"the region's oldest and largest art museum\\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year.  - The Young Shepherdess is an 1885 painting by William - Adolphe Bouguereau ( 1825 -- 1905 ) . It is owned by the San Diego Museum of Art. This and similar images by the artist attracted collectors in Europe and America because of their nostalgic content . In such works the artist depicted a variety of poses and expressions , in this case showing the mild curiosity of the girl . In portraying a shepherdess Bouguereau is working within the pastoral mode or theme , as developed by ancient Greek and Hellenistic artists and poets . French painters who preceded him in this include Claude Lorrain , Poussin , and Watteau .  - William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825  August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter and traditionalist. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes. In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work. Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.  - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States. It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country of origin' with 'france'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'country of origin' with 'France' is William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He was a French academic painter and traditionalist born on November 30, 1825, and is known for his realistic genre paintings, mythological themes, and modern interpretations of classical subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a study released in 2003 that highlights a decline in global arms sales for the third consecutive year. It emphasizes that the total value of arms sales dropped to 25.6 billion in 2003, down from a peak figure of 41 billion in 2000. In addition, the text reveals a shift in the geographical distribution of the largest buyers in the arms market, with Asia surpassing the Middle East as the most prominent customer. The figures cited in the text indicate a decrease in the demand for arms or a possible shift in international strategies, conflict dynamics, or economic conditions. The change in the identity of the biggest customer from the Middle East to Asia suggests that economic growth in Asian countries may have led to an increased capacity to purchase arms, or alternatively, it may reflect a rise in security concerns and a need to strengthen defense capabilities in the region. By informing readers of these changes in arms sales and buyer demographics, the text aims to draw attention to the evolving nature of the global arms market and highlight potential factors influencing these trends. This information could be relevant to policymakers, defense industries, and parties interested in understanding the ongoing trends in global arms trade and its implications on international security and economic relations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: These were the descendants of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the answer correctly answers the question.  The next settlement of people on Norfolk Island were primarily descended from the Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian. This unique mix of settlers has created the rich cultural heritage of the island today. In 1789, the HMS Bounty, led by Captain William Bligh, sailed from Tahiti to the West Indies. On April 28th, 1789, crew member Fletcher Christian led a mutiny against Captain William Bligh and took control of the ship. Bligh and 18 loyalists were forced into an open boat, while the mutineers sailed back to Tahiti. Following the mutiny, some of the mutineers decided to stay on Tahiti and the others, led by Fletcher Christian, his wife Maimiti (a daughter of a Tahitian chieftain), and eight other Tahitian men, twelve Tahitian women, and one child, left Tahiti in search of a safe haven. They eventually settled on Pitcairn Island in 1790 and began a new life there in isolation. In the years that followed, the population of Pitcairn Island increased, and by the mid-1800s, the island's limited resources could no longer support the growing community. As a result, the need for relocation arose. The British government offered them Norfolk Island as a new home, and in 1856, the entire community of nearly 200 people moved to Norfolk Island, thus establishing the next settlement on the island. The Norfolk Islanders, also known as the Pitcairn Islanders, were a blend of European (primarily British) and Tahitian heritage, as they were descendants of both the HMS Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians. The island's current population has a unique culture and speaks a distinct language called Norfolk, which is a blend of old English and Tahitian. This multicultural background has significantly helped shape the identity of Norfolk Island and its people today. In summary, the next settlement of people on Norfolk Island was primarily descended from the Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian. Their unique culture, language, and history continue to define the island and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine). During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne.

However, the fact that the mother kept the daughter's written request for forgiveness suggests that she cared deeply for her daughter, even if she did not directly communicate it. The keeping of the letter does not necessarily mean she forgave her but it does hint towards some sort of kindness and affection. This is further emphasized by her decision to pass on her beloved desk to the daughter, recognizing and supporting her love for writing.

In English, the word \\"authority\\" can have multiple meanings, and in these cases, it functions differently in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"The world's foremost authority on orangutans,\\" \\"authority\\" refers to a person or organization recognized as being the most knowledgeable or experienced in a particular subject or field. This use of the term entails credibility, expertise, and respect in regards to a specific area or discipline. In this context, the word \\"authority\\" conveys the idea that the person or organization being referred to holds considerable knowledge and understanding about orangutans, which makes them an expert in that field. In the second sentence, \\"Tennessee Valley Authority,\\" \\"authority\\" refers to a public administrative organization or government agency with specific powers and responsibilities in governing a particular area, region, or aspect of society.

She also has had notable stage performances and singing roles in musicals. Can we draw the following conclusion? Trini Alvarado is more highly regarded as a stage performer than a singer.","output":"Trini Alvarado has built a notable career in various forms of performing arts, including acting in films, stage performances, and singing in musicals. While it is true that she is best known for her roles in films such as \\"Little Women\\" and \\"The Frighteners\\", it cannot be determined that she is more highly regarded as a stage performer than a singer based solely on this information provided. For a more comprehensive view of her career, it would be essential to consider several factors. These include the number, variety, and success of her stage performances and singing roles in musicals, as well as any awards or critical reviews she received for these performances. It would also be important to examine the context and time period in which her career developed, as well as the overall cultural landscape of stage performance and musicals during her peak years in the industry. Alvarado began her career on stage as a child, performing in a Broadway production of \\"Runaways\\" in 1978. She received good reviews for her performance in this production and went on to have a successful career in stage acting, appearing in off-Broadway plays such as \\"Is There Life after High School?\\" and \\"Marisol\\". At the same time, she has sung in a variety of theatrical productions, including singing the role of Little Red Riding Hood in an Off-Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's \\"Into the Woods\\". Those experiences provided her with a significant background in both stage acting and singing. However, her film roles have garnered her wider recognition in the public eye. \\"Little Women\\" was a critical and commercial success, earning three Academy Award nominations and solidifying Alvarado's reputation as a talented actress. \\"The Frighteners\\", while not as critically acclaimed, highlighted her versatility in acting across genres. In conclusion, while Trini Alvarado has had significant successes in both stage performances and singing roles in musicals, determining whether she is more highly regarded as a stage performer or singer is not possible based solely on this information. More detailed analysis of her career, including critical reviews and reception to her various roles, would be required for a more definitive answer. It is possible that Alvarado might be appreciated equally as a stage performer and a singer, showcasing her diverse talents within the performing arts realm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - doctor - prescribed - pharmacy - medicine cabinet - capsule  I believe the correct choice is \\"pharmacy\\", here's why: A:","output":"When you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, you would go to a pharmacy to get it. A pharmacy is the correct choice among the options provided because it is the place where medications, including antibiotics, are dispensed to patients with a valid prescription. Here's a brief overview of the other options: 1. Doctor: Although your doctor prescribes the antibiotic, they usually do not dispense the medication themselves. Instead, they write or electronically send a prescription to a pharmacy that will provide you with the medication. 2. Prescribed: This term refers to the act of a doctor recommending a specific medication, dosage, and duration for an ailment. It is not a location where you would obtain the medication. 3. Medicine Cabinet: This is where people commonly store medications in their homes. However, you would not obtain a new prescription antibiotic from your medicine cabinet. You would acquire it from a pharmacy first, then store it in your medicine cabinet for future use. 4. Capsule: This is a form of medication, usually a small, cylindrical-shaped container that holds medicine in powder or liquid form. While an antibiotic may come in capsule form, the term does not refer to a location where you would get prescribed medication. In summary, when you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, you would go to a pharmacy to obtain the medication.

This completion of the paragraph best maintains the context and format established in the initial part. As we have learned from the initial information, the story being told revolves around the group of individuals donning Santa hats while partaking in an act of collective exercise on stationary bikes. The leader of the group, presumed to be the man featured at the front, sets the pace for the remaining individuals, and this supposed bonding activity unifies the group despite their potentially different backgrounds. Completing the paragraph with the phrase \\"continues to ride together in different shots while following the man in front..\\" manages to continue both the physical act of riding the exercise bikes, and also symbolically supports the theme of unity and collective action. This completion conveys a chronological progression of the situation - the group is still cycling, but it introduces the slight variability caused by changing camera shots. The focus remains on the group's activity as well as their continuing adherence to their leader's pacing, maintaining a sense of unity and collective determination. It must be noted that the other options introduce novel elements (coffee table, stunts, men speaking to the camera, and more people exercising away to a side) which, while they could potentially form part of the broader narrative, are jarring and disruptive to the context when introduced abruptly as a concluding statement of this particular paragraph.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Who was Miho to Motome? Movie title: Harakiri Movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome. Despite HanshirÅ's pleas, his Lord forbade him to kill himself. In order to... The answer is:","output":"Miho was Motome's wife in the movie \\"Harakiri.\\" The film, set in Edo period Japan, tells the story of ronin Tsugumo Hanshirō who arrives at the estate of the Ii clan, expressing his intent to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) within the palace courtyard. While trying to dissuade Hanshirō from this decision, Daimyo's senior counselor, Saitō Kageyu, recounts the tragic story of fellow ronin Chijiiwa Motome, who had arrived at the palace with the same request and was forced to follow through with his bamboo sword. Both Hanshirō and Motome were formerly from the same clan. Throughout the film, it is revealed that Hanshirō did, in fact, know Motome. In the past, Hanshirō had been assigned the guardianship of Motome by a close friend who committed seppuku. Motome, who grew up under Hanshirō's care, later married Miho, and together they had a son. Due to their impoverished circumstances as ronins, their living situation was difficult, and both Miho and their son became ill. Desperate to support his family, Motome sold his sword's steel blade and replaced it with one made of bamboo. The story of Motome's forced suicide by the Ii clan deeply affects Hanshirō, and he ultimately seeks retribution against the three samurai who were involved in the decision to force Motome's seppuku. The character of Miho serves as a key emotional connection for the audience to understand the depth of Hanshirō's motivations and the tragic consequences of the actions of the Ii clan on their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here is an article: Up to foot of snow is expected to fall in parts of the mid-Atlantic Monday as a massive mid-winter storm canceled flights and gave a snow day to schoolchildren and federal workers alike. Snow began falling in the nation's capital early Monday, and officials warned people to stay off treacherous, icy roads — a refrain that has become familiar to residents in the Midwest, East and even Deep South this year. The latest frigid blow of the harsh winter threatened as much as 10 inches of snow by the end of the day in Washington, Baltimore and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic region. Up to 6 inches of snow was predicted to the north in Philadelphia, while nearly a foot of snow was expected in parts of New Jersey. \\"We're tired of it. We're sick of it,\\" said Martin Peace, a web developer from the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va. He and his wife were walking on the National Mall with their young daughter Sunday before the frigid weather blew in. Both bemoaned the number of snowy days this year. \\"It's been hard with a baby being stuck in the house,\\" said Nicole Peace, who works in human resources. \\"We don't really get the day off, but then we have to work from home with the baby, which is hard.\\" The forecasts were enough to shut much of Washington down. On Sunday night, the federal government announced that its Washington-area offices would be closed Monday. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which sets leave policies for 300,000 federal workers in the region, says non-emergency personnel are granted excused absences for the day. School systems in Baltimore, Washington and many suburban areas were closed, as were all Smithsonian museums except for the National Air and Space Museum. However, the U.S. Supreme Court was expected to be open and had arguments scheduled for Monday. The wintry precipitation moved across much of the nation Sunday, bringing a mix of freezing rain and heavy snow to central and eastern states. Authorities warned of possible power outages and flight disruptions from weather that could affect millions. Nearly 3,000 flights in the United States were canceled early Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. The bulk of the problems were at airports in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. There are more than 30,000 flights in the United States on a typical day. In central Kentucky on Monday morning, vehicles moved slowly and quietly on roads that were mostly snow covered and slushy despite plows going through. The lines separating lanes were mostly invisible under the snow and ice, and at least a few cars had slid off the roadways. In Ohio, crews in Cincinnati were treating roads as a mix of freezing rain and snow fell late Sunday. A suspension bridge over the Ohio River between Cincinnati and Kentucky was closed Sunday because of ice covering its hard-to-treat metal grid deck. Freezing rain and sleet moved across Kentucky, making road travel treacherous Sunday. Officials warned residents to avoid unnecessary travel. Parts of the state could receive up to 8 inches of sleet and snow through Monday. Churches throughout the state canceled services. Parts of West Virginia could also get up to a foot of snow. That sent residents on a hunt for food, water and supplies. Linda McGilton of Charleston said she tries to be prepared but she also was not concerned. \\"I don't try to panic. It doesn't do any good,\\" McGilton of Charleston said as she unloaded a grocery cart outside the Kroger store. Richmond, Va., was expected to get as many as 7 inches of snow Monday. Katilynn Allan, 22, bemoaned the city's unpredictable weather but said she was not too worried about driving if she had to make the short commute to her job as a financial planner. \\"It's not too bad,\\" said Allan. \\"You just have to take it slow when there is ice on the road.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A cold snap will take hold of Britain over the next few days as freezing winds sweep across the nation. Strong gusts of up to 50mph will mean that temperatures hovering around freezing point could feel more like -10 degrees in some areas. The chilly winds and overnight frosts will cover all of Britain, while the east will be affected by light snow flurries. Large swathes of the South-West and West Coast will be sunny today and tomorrow, while the East faces snow flurries and clouds. Wrap up warm: A pair of horses in the Peak District near Hartington, Derbyshire, are swaddled in blankets to escape the cold. A freezing east wind forced the horses to huddle up together against a dry stone wall. In the West Midlands night temperatures are expected to plunge to -4C, while tomorrow could see London and the South-East hit by snow. The temperatures are much colder than normal for this time of year, a weather expert said, when we should expect averages of around six to eight degrees. Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'It's certainly going to feel much colder today and over the weekend. Among the snowdrops: Rose Cheeseman, three, wraps up warm at Kingston Lacy House in Dorset as extreme cold returns to Britain today. 'Temperatures are expected to stay just above freezing point throughout the day, but with the wind chill factor it could feel more like than -5 degrees, or even -10 degrees where the winds are strongest. 'They could hit around 50mph in Cornwall, while the rest of Britain will see gusts of around 30mph and higher in exposed areas. 'These temperatures are very cold for this time of year. We expect cold weather in February but it is impressively cold really.' On Saturday there is an increasing. risk of snow flurries coming in from the east and spreading across the. west towards Wales leaving a dusting of snow behind. It will remain cold on Sunday with more wintery showers before temperatures start to rise on Monday. The Met Office has issued a health alert amid fears the freezing weather could ravage the health. of the elderly, young children and other vulnerable people. The Met Office said: ‘Prolonged. periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young,. very old, or those with chronic diseases.’ ‘This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.’ Joy: There were windy but spring-like conditions in Cornwall today as children enjoyed a half-term walk through a daffodils field. Nature's glory: The boys run through the fields with St Michael's Mount in the background. A. Met Office spokesman added: ‘The main thing we’re concerned with is the. cold and how it will have an effect on health, rather than travel and. transport.’ A Department of. Health spokesperson said: 'Severe cold weather can be dangerous,. especially for the very young or very old or those with chronic disease. 'You. can find advice on how to reduce your risk or that of somebody you know. on the NHS Choices website, ringing NHS Direct on 0845 46 47 or. contacting your local GP or pharmacist. 'The NHS is well prepared for the winter and we are providing an extra £330 million to the NHS and social care services to help cope with the added pressure that the winter brings.' The cold will. be heightened by strong winds dragged over the North Sea from. Scandinavia and Siberia, especially in southern areas, which will also. face ‘penetrating overnight frosts’. The Met Office also warned that roads. and pavements are likely to be icy over the next five days, but no major. disruption from snow is expected. Here we go again: The snow that hit London earlier this month could return tomorrow. In this picture, commuters wait in the snow at Crystal Palace station on February 11. After a frosty start today, it will be a cold and breezy day across the UK with sunny spells. The. best of the sunshine will be across western England, while central and. eastern parts of the country will be fairly cloudy with the chance of a. few snow flurries towards North Sea coasts.

Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\\".

Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \\"heads\\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \\"upside down lettering error\\" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.

If Don't ask those on their way in, though., can we conclude that \\"Don't ask the people coming in.\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"Don't ask those on their way in, though.\\" can certainly be rephrased as \\"Don't ask the people coming in.\\" The primary reference of these phrases is almost identical: both are instructing not to ask a particular group of people. However, they use slightly different wording to describe this group of people.  The original phrase, \\"Don't ask those on their way in, though,\\" uses the term 'those on their way in'. This is a more roundabout or conversational way of referring to the people who are coming in. It might be used when the speaker is trying to convey a sense of informality, or to slightly obscure who exactly they are talking about.  On the other hand, the rephrased sentence, \\"Don't ask the people coming in,\\" is more direct and explicit. This could be interpreted as a more straightforward instruction, with no room for misunderstanding about who should not be asked. The use of 'the people coming in' directly identifies the specific group in question. In terms of tone, the first phrase may come across as a bit more casual or informal, while the second phrase is likely to be perceived as more serious or formal. The level of formality and the use of indirect or direct language can affect how the command is interpreted and responded to, even though the overall message is the same.  One important thing to note, however, is that both these phrases do not indicate why one should not ask those people coming in, nor what one should not ask. These sentences rely heavily on context. The listener needs to understand some information about the situation that is not included in the sentence itself to fully understand the intended meaning. In conclusion, the two phrases carry the same general message but their tone, explicitness, and formality may vary. The choice between them may be influenced by the intended audience, the nature of the question that isn't to be asked, and the relationship between the speaker and the person they're instructing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, both Super Furry Animals and Juliette and the Licks can be considered rock bands, as they both fall under the broad genre of rock music. Although they have distinct sounds and styles, they share a foundation in the rock genre, which has evolved over the years to encompass a wide range of musical styles. To better understand the nature of these two bands and their place within the rock genre, let us delve deeper into their background, influences, and overall sound. Super Furry Animals, a Welsh rock band formed in 1993, is known for their eclectic, innovative, and experimental style. The band members include Gruff Rhys (lead vocals and guitar), Huw \\"Bunf\\" Bunford (guitar and vocals), Guto Pryce (bass guitar), Cian Ciaran (keyboards, synthesizers, and electronics), and Dafydd Ieuan (drums and vocals). The band's music often combines various elements of rock, pop, electronic, and psychedelic music, resulting in a unique and captivating sound. Their discography is diverse, with albums such as \\"Fuzzy Logic\\" (1996), which features a predominantly Britpop sound, and \\"Radiator\\" (1997), which leans more towards psychedelic and experimental rock. As their career progressed, Super Furry Animals continued to explore new sonic territories, incorporating even more varied styles, including techno and electronic music in albums such as \\"Love Kraft\\" (2005) and \\"Dark Days/Light Years\\" (2009). Despite their distinct sound, Super Furry Animals are often associated with the wider rock scene and have been praised by critics for their ability to consistently push the boundaries of contemporary rock music. Juliette and the Licks, an American rock band formed in 2004, features Juliette Lewis as the lead vocalist, Todd Morse (guitar and vocals), Kemble Walters (guitar), and Jason Womack (bass guitar and vocals). The band's sound can be described as a high-energy fusion of garage rock, punk, and alternative rock, with clear influences from bands like The Stooges, MC5, and The Clash. Their debut album, \\"You're Speaking My Language\\" (2005), is characterized by its raw, unfiltered energy and Lewis's unmistakable, passionate vocal delivery. They followed this with \\"Four on the Floor\\" (2006), which showcases a more polished sound while maintaining the band's signature intensity and swagger. Even though the band disbanded in 2009, their music continues to be associated with the rock genre, and their relentless live performances have solidified their presence in the world of rock music. In conclusion, both Super Furry Animals and Juliette and the Licks are rock bands in their own right. Although each band has its unique style and characteristics, they share a common foundation in the rock genre. Super Furry Animals' innovative approach to music and experimentation, as well as Juliette and the Licks' high-energy fusion of garage, punk, and alternative rock, contribute to the vast diversity and rich tapestry of modern rock music.

Use the definition of a subsequence: a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 2. When comparing the elements of the two lists, we can use a dynamic programming approach to identify the longest common subsequence. This involves creating a table where we store the lengths of common subsequences between the first \`i\` elements of list A and the first \`j\` elements of list B. 3. Initialize the table with dimensions (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1), setting all the elements to 0. 4. Iterate through the lists A and B using two nested loops. In each iteration, compare the current elements from both lists. If they are the same, update the table at the position [i+1][j+1] with the value of the table at the position [i][j] + 1. If the elements are different, update the table at the position [i+1][j+1] with the maximum value between the table at positions [i+1][j] and [i][j+1]. 5. After filling the table, the value at the bottom-right corner (table[len(A)][len(B)]) will represent the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the actual longest common subsequence, backtrack from the table's bottom-right corner. Here's the Python code that finds the longest common subsequence: \`\`\`python def longest_common_subsequence(A, B):     len_A, len_B = len(A), len(B)     table = [[0] * (len_B + 1) for _ in range(len_A + 1)]     for i, a in enumerate(A):         for j, b in enumerate(B):             if a == b:                 table[i+1][j+1] = table[i][j] + 1             else:                 table[i+1][j+1] = max(table[i+1][j], table[i][j+1])     result = []     i, j = len_A, len_B     while i > 0 and j > 0:         if table[i][j] == table[i-1][j]:             i -= 1         elif table[i][j] == table[i][j-1]:             j -= 1         else:             result.append(A[i-1])             i -= 1             j -= 1     return result[::-1] A = [9885, 'o', 5887, 2179, 3705, 'J', 'h', 'h', 653, 2331, 'P', '4217', 'W', '3979', 'e', '3549', '1933', '585', '9525', 'O', 'V', 'a', 'R'] B = ['A', 5259, 'q', 'W', 2793, 'x', 'T', 's', 'P', '4217', 'W', '3979', 'e', '3549', '1933', '585', '9525', 'O', 'U', 3211, 851, 3405, 'D', 191, 'i', 't'] lcs = longest_common_subsequence(A, B) print(\\"Longest common subsequence:\\", lcs) \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` Longest common subsequence: ['P', '4217', 'W', '3979', 'e', '3549', '1933', '585', '9525', 'O'] \`\`\` In this solution, we used the definition of the longest common subsequence and dynamic programming to find and return the longest common subsequence between the two input lists A and B, which is \`['P', '4217', 'W', '3979', 'e', '3549', '1933', '585', '9525', 'O']\`."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"(In 1996, only 30 percent of all junk bonds went to finance LBOs.)\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"In 1996, junk bonds weren't performing very well.\\" true?","output":"The premise provided -- \\"In 1996, only 30 percent of all junk bonds went to finance LBOs (Leveraged Buyouts)\\" -- doesn't provide enough information to determine or support the hypothesis that \\"In 1996, junk bonds weren't performing very well.\\" Junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds, are bonds that are rated below investment grade by credit rating agencies. They have a higher risk of default compared to investment-grade bonds, but to attract investors, they offer higher yields. The reason they're called \\"junk\\" is because of their high risk, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're not performing well. Meanwhile, Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) are a strategy used by companies to acquire other businesses using a significant sum of borrowed money (bonds or loans) to meet the purchase cost. The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans. LBOs do carry risk, but successful ones can lead to high returns, which makes junk bonds a fitting resource for funding these kinds of transactions. The premise given provides a stat that 30% of all junk bonds in 1996 went to finance LBOs. However, this doesn't tell us anything about the performance of junk bonds in that year. That 30% could have been funding successful, profitable LBOs, or they could have been sunk into unsuccessful ones. Furthermore, it leaves 70% of all junk bonds unaccounted for - we don't know where those were invested or how they performed. Performance of junk bonds can be determined through various factors such as their default rate, recovery rate after default, the yield they're offering compared to safer bonds, and how these rates change over time. To determine the performance of junk bonds for the year 1996, one would need data on these aspects. In conclusion, to assess or confirm the validity of the hypothesis that \\"In 1996, junk bonds weren't performing very well,\\" there would need to be more specific information available about their performance parameters (like default rates, yields, et cetera) for that year. The datum about the percentage of junk bonds used for LBOs in that year alone doesn't provide sufficient evidence to support this assertion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The IPO should cost what the investors think it is worth. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the claims made in Sentence 1 and Sentence 2. Sentence 1 claim: The price of an IPO should reflect as nearly as possible what investors really think about a company's prospects. Sentence 2 claim: The IPO should cost what the investors think it is worth. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the claims. Both sentences are discussing the pricing of an IPO based on investor opinions. Sentence 1 emphasizes the importance of the IPO price reflecting what investors think about the company's prospects. Sentence 2 states that the IPO should cost according to what investors think it is worth, which is based on their thoughts on its value. Step 3: Evaluate if the two claims logically support each other. Given that both claims focus on the importance of investor opinions in determining the value of an IPO, it can be inferred that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 would logically be true too. This is because the value investors give to an IPO is intrinsically tied to their thoughts on the company's prospects, and the IPO price should reflect that.

He says that \\"an animal needs to attract a mate to reproduce\\" and \\"every member of every species needs to meet the challenges of survival and of reproduction\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question?  1). disaster 2). warmth 3). food 4). space 5). predators 6). smell 7). mate 8). DNA Answer:","output":"From the hints given by the teacher, it's clear that one of the fundamental things an animal needs to ensure survival is a mate. This aligns with the biological concept of survival and reproduction. It's important to remember that while all organisms need essential elements such as food, warmth, and space to live and grow, reproduction is just as vital for the survival of their species as a whole. The possibility of the 'mate' being the right answer to the question is strongly supported by the teacher's hints. Firstly, the teacher stated that \\"an animal needs to attract a mate to reproduce\\". This suggests the necessity of having a mate for reproduction, a critical factor for the survival of the species. Secondly, the teacher mentioned that \\"every member of every species needs to meet the challenges of survival and of reproduction\\". This reinforces the fact that not only must an animal survive by meeting its basic needs like food, warmth, and space, but it should also reproduce to ensure the continuity of its species. Other options like 'disaster', 'predators', 'smell', or 'DNA' don't directly answer the quiz question because they don't qualify as something an animal must find. Rather, these concepts describe environmental challenges, predatory threats, sensory capabilities, and genetic makeup, respectively. So, considering the central theme of the hints provided by the teacher and the critical biological necessity of reproduction for survival, the best answer to this quiz question would be 7). mate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who calculated the critical mass of uranium?  At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

Wrapping them up in one of the spare towels, he set them aside to dry and slipped on a pair of borrowed flip-flops from the pool house. As he made his way back to the gathering outside, he noticed that the party was in full swing. The sun was shining brightly overhead, warming the air and casting a cheerful golden glow over everything. Children laughed and splashed in the shallow end of the pool, while adults lounged on deckchairs, sipping on cold drinks and engaging in lively conversations. Tim found himself drawn to the barbeque area, where a tall man named Jake was showing off his grilling skills. The mouthwatering aroma of seared meat and smokey spices filled the air, making it difficult for anyone to resist. Tim grinned at the sight – he had always loved barbeques and their vibrant, convivial atmosphere. It was hard not to lose oneself in the enjoyment of good food, fun company, and the great outdoors. Talking to Jake as he flipped burgers and sausages with dexterous flips of his spatula, Tim discovered that they had a common passion for travel. They spoke animatedly about their previous adventures and dream destinations, sparking laughter and good-natured envy from those who overheard their stories. The connection between the two men was instant, and they agreed that they should explore the city together one weekend soon, Tim acting as a local guide and Jake sharing his experiences from his international escapades. As the afternoon wore on, Tim found a seat next to a lovely woman named Stella. He was immediately struck by her radiant smile and the easy grace with which she carried herself. Sensing a kindred spirit, Tim delved into conversation and soon discovered that they shared a love for art, poetry, and photography. Time seemed to fly as they spoke, the words flowing naturally, as if they'd known each other for years. Feeling a pang of hunger, they decided to head back to the barbeque. Jake had finished his grilling duties and was now commandeering a game of beach volleyball; he waved as Tim and Stella approached. With full plates and satisfied grins, they found a quiet spot to continue their conversation. As the sun began to set, casting a fiery red and orange glow on the horizon, Tim reflected back on his day. His earlier frustration seemed so insignificant now. Friendships had blossomed, new connections were made, and the evening promised a lively round of drinks and dancing. And although his shoes had been unceremoniously drenched earlier, he had found two new friends and shared unforgettable moments with them. He realized, sometimes life could surprise you in the most unexpected ways. Not every mishap was a tragedy; some had a silver lining hidden within, waiting to be discovered. As the first stars twinkled in the sky, Tim looked across the pool – his soggy old sneakers lay forgotten in their forgotten towel bundle – and felt deeply grateful for the turn of events that led him to this moment. With a warm heart and newfound friends by his side, he felt ready to embrace whatever other surprises life had in store for him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The restaurant was 1/4 to 1/3 full but we sat there through at least 4 songs (about 15-20 min.) and no one asked us if we wanted a drink, brought us a glass of water, or acknowledged our presence in any way.  The hostesses were directly behind us, there was wait staff milling around chatting and cleaning other tables, a chef was chatting it up on the patio with other guests but we were completely ignored. I would've liked to try the food but the service was non-existent (other than being immediately seated by the hostess) so that we wound up walking out. Is this review positive or negative? OPTIONS:  A). negative;  B). positive; Answer:","output":"A). negative This review is negative because the person talks about their bad experience at the restaurant where they were ignored by the staff, had to wait for a long time without anyone acknowledging them, and eventually left without trying the food. The other option, B). positive, is incorrect because the review does not mention any good or pleasant experience in the restaurant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You want to have 4% skim milk and 3% sweetened condensed milk, almost like you would in regular milkshakes, right before pouring it in..  - Pour the half to half and milk mixture into the freezer container. Keeping this aside, fill the container approximately ¾ of the way with the cream mixture..  - Mix 1/2 spoon of coffee powder with the 1/2 spoon of cocoa powder. This helps the ice cream achieve a balanced taste of both flavors..  - You'll be whisking the milkshake, so it needs to be blended. If you're using a blender or food processor, combine the cocoa powder, the oreo, and the sugar in a blender or food processor..","output":"Option 4 sounds interesting and delicious. So, let's continue with that: 1. After whisking the cream and sweetened condensed milk together, set the mixture aside. 2. In a blender or food processor, combine the following ingredients:   - 1/2 spoon of coffee powder   - 1/2 spoon of cocoa powder   - 10-12 crushed Oreo cookies (you can save some for garnishing later)   - 1/4 cup of granulated sugar 3. Blend the ingredients together until they form a fine powder. This combination will ensure a balanced taste between the coffee, cocoa, and Oreo flavors. 4. Once the dry ingredients are well mixed, add the whisked cream and sweetened condensed milk mixture to the blender or food processor. Be sure to mix everything well so that it is evenly distributed and well combined. The consistency of your mixture will look like a thick milkshake at this stage. 5. Next, pour the combined mixture into a freezer-safe container, making sure to fill the container about ¾ of the way up. You can use a shallow container or a loaf pan for easy scooping later. 6. If you'd like to add more Oreo texture to your ice cream, crumble a few more Oreos and gently swirl them into the mixture using a spatula or spoon. 7. Cover the container with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent any freezer odors from affecting the taste of your ice cream. 8. Freeze the mixture for at least 5 hours, or overnight for best results. This will allow the ice cream to set and become a solid, scoopable consistency. 9. Once your Oreo coffee ice cream is ready, remove it from the freezer and let it sit for a few minutes to soften slightly. Then, using an ice cream scoop, serve your delicious homemade Oreo coffee ice cream in bowls or cones. 10.

There were so many colors and fun decorations, and it smelled like a giant baking party! The people working there were so friendly and full of smiles, just like us when we're happy. They helped us choose the best ice cream flavors, and we could even taste little samples before making up our minds. We went with Cookie Monster Blue and Magical Unicorn Rainbow Swirl, which were super delicious and made our taste buds dance. They also let us choose the coolest toppings like rainbow sprinkles, marshmallows, and gummy bears! We got to sit at a big round table shaped like an ice cream cone, and they had coloring sheets and crayons for us to play with while we enjoyed our treat. We laughed, shared stories, and even made new friends with the other kids there. We had a wonderful time at Happy Scoops Ice Cream Shop, and we can't wait to go back!

My night began with a warm welcome by the impressive and sophisticated staff, the ambiance whisking me away into a world of pure culinary magic. I seldom take the time to write reviews, but my experience at this astounding establishment calls for it. Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the romantic and serene atmosphere created by the soft lighting and an alluring array of lush, green plants that adorned the walls and pathways. It felt as if I had stepped into an emerald oasis, making it the perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The hostess promptly guided us to our table, which was nestled amidst a cozy arrangement of ornate chairs and elegantly set tables. Our server, Bianca, greeted us with the warmest smile and unparalleled professionalism. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionately enriched us with details about the dishes, which truly enhanced our dining experience. We began our taste journey with the Chef's Special Appetizer Platter, which was a dazzling melange of flavors and textures. The bruschetta was topped with vibrant heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, and a perfect balance of garlic and balsamic dressing. I also savored the pan-seared scallops, surrounded by a velvety citrus-infused sauce that complemented the sweetness of the dish. For our main course, my partner and I decided to share the Seafood Paella and Truffle Mushroom Risotto. The paella was abundant with fragrant saffron-infused rice, succulent shrimp, tender mussels, and delicate clams; it was truly an explosion of flavors that delighted our palates. The Truffle Mushroom Risotto was equally impressive, blending luscious, earthy truffles with creamy Parmesan, and the al dente Arborio rice was cooked to absolute perfection. At Bianca's insistence, we decided to save room for dessert—a decision I will forever cherish. We indulged in a heavenly slice of Chocolate Decadence Cake which was, without a doubt, the most divine creation I have ever tasted. The rich, velvety chocolate ganache perfectly complemented the moist layers of cake, while a scoop of homemade raspberry sorbet added a refreshing and tart contrast, making for an unforgettable finale to our meal. The service throughout the evening remained attentive and seamless, with Bianca ensuring all of our needs were met while never being intrusive. It's safe to say that the staff at The Enchanted Garden exudes genuine warmth and an unwavering commitment to providing an unparalleled dining experience. The Enchanted Garden is a true gem that embodies the essence of fine dining. Their exceptional attention to detail, unparalleled service, and delectable cuisine make it a must-visit, whether for a romantic date or a special celebration.

Given the question: Article: Exercise is one of the few factors with a positive role in long-term control of body weight. Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \\"light\\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet. In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight. If you have been sedentary   and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. Question: \\"Even exercise professionals accept half a point here\\" means \\"They  _  \\". Yes or no, is the answer \\"partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction.\\" To arrive at the correct answer, let's break down the text step by step: 1. The article discusses the importance of exercise in maintaining long-term control over body weight. 2. It mentions that most Americans do not prioritize exercise over dietary changes. 3. The phrase \\"Even exercise professionals accept half a point here\\" is an acknowledgment from exercise professionals that exercise alone may not be sufficient to make significant weight loss happen. 4. It is followed by a quote from York Onnen: \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight.\\" 5. Despite this, the article highlights the importance of exercise as a supporting factor in weight reduction. From these points, it becomes evident that the exercise professionals partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction. They accept that exercise alone may not be enough, thereby giving some weight to the importance of incorporating diet changes as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I enjoyed it so much that I watched it a second time when they had an encore screening. When I think of the films that are shown at festivals, I usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. There's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and I enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes I want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making. By \\"mainstream,\\" I mean more like a film produced for national release - In other words, a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater.

As I watched The Big Bad Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. The reason I felt this way was because I was so impressed with every aspect of this production. I left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B?  Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. The answer is:","output":"In case A, the wildebeests would have a lower risk of attack from the lions. This is because of the dilution effect described in the hint. When animals live in a group, their risk of attack is \\"diluted\\" because each individual makes up just one of many in the group. As the group becomes larger, it becomes more conspicuous, but the risk to each individual decreases. In case A, the wildebeests cross the Mara river in a very large group, which means the risk for each individual wildebeest is lower due to the dilution effect. In case B, the wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups, meaning there is a higher risk for each individual because the dilution effect is less pronounced. The examples provided in the hint, such as shoaling fish, Camargue horses, and water striders, all support this idea that the attack rate per individual decreases as group size increases."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let us break down the key components of each statement and examine them separately. Premise: 1. \\"Long-standing modernization management and technical weaknesses\\": This suggests that there have been ongoing issues related to modernization management and technical aspects within the IRS. 2. \\"Before IRS invests large sums of modernization funds\\": This implies that IRS is planning to invest significant resources into modernizing its systems, processes, or overall infrastructure. 3. \\"The key to effectively addressing these challenges\\": The statement indicates that addressing these weaknesses is critical to overcoming the challenges facing the IRS. Hypothesis: \\"There are many technical weaknesses within the IRS.\\" Based on the premise, we can infer that there indeed exist technical weaknesses within the IRS. The premise highlights the existence of \\"long-standing modernization management and technical weaknesses,\\" suggesting that some form of technical deficiencies have been present for an extended period. However, we must be cautious about concluding that there are \\"many\\" technical weaknesses. The premise does not provide information about the quantity or severity of these technical weaknesses. It's important to consider that while there might be some technical weaknesses present, they may not necessarily be numerous or severe enough to support the hypothesis. To further evaluate the hypothesis, we can seek additional information on the subject. This can involve researching specific examples of technical weaknesses the IRS has previously dealt with, gathering information on past modernization efforts that were challenged due to these weaknesses or even obtaining expert opinions from professionals who are familiar with the IRS systems and processes. In conclusion, the premise suggests the existence of technical weaknesses within the IRS, but it is not enough to confirm whether or not \\"many\\" technical weaknesses indeed persist. A more nuanced approach, combining the premise with supplementary information and real-world examples, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of whether the hypothesis is true or not."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He called Essper George, and gave him all necessary directions for the morning. About three o'clock Vivian lay down on a sofa, and slept for a few hours. He started often in his short and feverish slumber. His dreams were unceasing and inexplicable. At first von Sohnspeer was their natural hero; but soon the scene shifted. Vivian was at Ems, walking under the well-remembered lime-trees, and with the Baroness. Suddenly, although it was mid-day, the Sun became large, blood-red, and fell out of the heavens; his companion screamed, a man rushed forward with a drawn sword. It was the idiot Crown Prince of Reisenburg. Vivian tried to oppose him, but without success. The infuriated ruffian sheathed his weapon in the heart of the Baroness. Vivian shrieked, and fell upon her body, and, to his horror, found himself embracing the cold corpse of Violet Fane!  Vivian and Essper mounted their horses about seven o'clock. At eight they had reached a small inn near the Forest Councillor's house, where Vivian was to remain until Essper had watched the entrance of the Minister. It was a few minutes past nine when Essper returned with the joyful intelligence that Owlface and his master had been seen to enter the Courtyard. Vivian immediately mounted Max, and telling Essper to keep a sharp watch, he set spurs to his horse.  \\"Now, Max, my good steed, each minute is golden; serve thy master well!\\" He patted the horse's neck, the animal's erected ears proved how well it understood its master's wishes; and taking advantage of the loose bridle, which was confidently allowed it, the horse sprang rather than galloped to the Minister's residence.

The premise states that a large crowd of people are checking out at a public store, which provides sufficient information to support the hypothesis that the crowd of people is indeed at a store. To break it down further, let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis in more detail: Premise: A large crowd of people is checking out at a public store. - This statement gives us the information about the location and the activity of the crowd of people. The location is a public store, and the activity is checking out. Hypothesis: The crowd of people is at a store. - This statement is focusing only on the location of the crowd and does not touch upon the activity they are engaged in. As our hypothesis is only concerned with the location, it can be considered a subset of the information provided in the premise. Since the location mentioned in the hypothesis (a store) matches the location given in the premise (a public store), we can safely conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect. However, the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague.[citation needed] Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Which model explains why bob has an easier time reading a book, and then discussing it rather than reading two books?","output":"The question you have posed can indeed be answered. The model that explains why Bob has an easier time reading a book and then discussing it rather than reading two books is the Working Memory Model. The Working Memory Model, proposed by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch in 1974, consists of different components, including the central executive, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer. These components interact and work together to enable us to manipulate and process information in our mental workspace. When Bob reads a book and then discusses it, he uses different components of his working memory more effectively than when reading two books simultaneously. Reading and discussing a book allows Bob to focus on one task at a time, utilizing the phonological loop for processing the linguistic information and the visuospatial sketchpad for creating mental images related to the narrative. The central executive oversees these separate components while the episodic buffer integrates the information into a unified whole, allowing Bob to have a comprehensive understanding of the book. In contrast, when Bob attempts to read two books simultaneously, he places a higher demand on his working memory, particularly on the central executive. The central executive is responsible for managing attention, coordination, and allocation of resources between tasks. Reading two books at once requires the central executive to divide its resources, leading to interference and poorer performance. This may result in difficulty retaining information from both books, compromising comprehension and effective discussion. Moreover, the dual-task nature of reading two books creates a higher cognitive load, resulting in a competition for resources within the same working memory components (e.g., the phonological loop for processing text). This competition further hinders Bob's ability to effectively comprehend and retain the information as compared to when he reads and discusses a single book.  In conclusion, the Working Memory Model explains why Bob has an easier time reading a book and then discussing it rather than reading two books simultaneously. Focusing on one book allows for efficient use of working memory components, while attempting to read two books places a higher demand on the central executive and creates interference within the same components, leading to less effective information processing and comprehension."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Photo: Joyce Tenneson      When Kathleen Turner, standing in the Vulture reception area, introduces herself in her singular throaty rasp, the effect is almost comic — who else has a voice like that? “This thing happens with restaurants,” says Turner as we walk to a conference room. “I’ll call up and say, ‘This is Kathleen Turner,’ and they’ll hear me and say, ‘Why yes it is.’”      For a time, that voice, and her charismatic blend of steel and sass, made Turner one of film’s most interesting and popular actresses. The now-64-year-old starred in an impressive string of ’80s hits (Body Heat, Prizzi’s Honor, and Peggy Sue Got Married, among others, as well as The War of the Roses, Romancing the Stone, and The Jewel of the Nile, the latter trio all co-starring Michael Douglas). But by the mid-’90s, as a result of a devastating combination of illness, addiction, and, she says, an unfair reputation for being hard to work with, her era of big Hollywood success was over. Since then, Turner, a blunt talker, has turned most of her formidable energy to theater, and also regularly conducts master classes for acting students across the country. “I’ve been acting professionally for 41 years,” says Turner. “I think my ability to maintain a career for that long has a little something to do with quality, don’t you think?” She teasingly arches an eyebrow. “Maybe I’m being pie-eyed.”      I randomly caught Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? on TV the other night and it made me wonder if you’d watched Elizabeth Taylor’s performance before you played Martha?      God, no. Quite the opposite. For a while I felt like half my life was making her wrongs right.      Sorry, Elizabeth Taylor’s?      Yes. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof — you ever listen to her voice? It’s awful.      But you’ve got one of the all-time great voices. Maybe that makes you a tough critic.      No. She has a bad voice, badly used. In any case, people are after me all the time to do Sweet Bird of Youth, and I’m like, “Enough Taylor shit.”      Maybe you don’t like Elizabeth Taylor’s acting, but she was at least charismatic in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? wasn’t she?      I don’t think she was very skilled. And Edward Albee disliked the film intensely. In the play, when George comes in he pours himself a drink and then nurses that drink the whole evening. The film got that completely wrong. Taylor and Richard Burton are drunk and screaming at each other the whole time. I heard somebody once say [about the film], “I get this at home. Why would I go see it?” But I was lucky that I got to do the play myself and show the humor in it for God’s sake. Luck has a big part in anyone’s career, yeah?      What else, aside from luck, has driven your career?      Rage.      What do you mean?      I’m fuckin’ angry, man.      About what?      Everything.      Where does that anger come from?      Injustice in the world.      How does rage show up in your work?      In my cabaret show I use this passage from Molly Ivins: “Beloveds, these are some bad, ugly, angry times. And I am so freaked out. Hatred has stolen the conversation. The poor are now voting against themselves. But politics is not about left or right. It’s about up and down. The few screwing the many.” She wrote that over ten years ago and it’s no less true today.      Is any part of the rage you feel related to how illness derailed your career?      I’m too busy coping with disease to think much outside the day-to-day. For me it’s can I hold a pen? Can I stand up? Can I climb those stairs?      So you don’t feel as if part of your prime was unfairly taken from you?      I suppose there was a feeling of loss. Rheumatoid arthritis hit in my late 30s — the last of my years in which Hollywood would consider me a sexually appealing leading lady. The hardest part was that so much of my confidence was based on my physicality. If I didn’t have that, who was I?      What was the answer?      To fuckin’ get it back. You work with what you have, as best you can. That’s what I’ve done.      How difficult was it to deal with the knowledge that some guys in Hollywood had arbitrarily decided you were no longer viable as a leading lady?      It took adjustment. You have to remember that my first big role was Body Heat, and after that I was a sexual target. I understood later, from Michael Douglas, that there was a competition between him and Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty about who would get me first. None of them did, by the by.      How did learning about that competition make you feel?      I don’t like being thought of as a trophy. Let me tell you, when Jack and I were shooting Prizzi’s Honor a bunch of us went to his place up on Mulholland [Drive]. Jack said, knowing Warren’s interest in me, “Why don’t you call Warren and tell him I don’t have a corkscrew.” “Why?” “You’ll see how fast he gets here.” There was an unspoken assumption that women were property to be claimed. Another time I was at a dinner party and there was an empty chair next to Jack. I sat down in it and had a delightful time. After a while — because I was shooting the next day — I said I had to leave and drove back to the Chateau Marmont. I get there and the phone rings. It was Jack: “How could you do that to me?” “Do what?” “You were my date and you left!” And I said, “I was your date? No one informed me.” Assumptions like that are why I’ve never lived in Los Angeles. Every time I go to that city I feel insecure.      How was Nicholson to work with?      He was great. Partly that’s to do with John Huston. He challenged Jack. He said to Jack that he always winked at the audience as if to say, “That’s not what I mean.” John challenged him to not do that, to not put a lie to his character, which can be very tempting for stars to do because you want audiences to like you. Avoiding that temptation is a great lesson.      When did you learn it?      Very early. My first Broadway show was Gemini in ’78. I played this spoiled white girl whose boyfriend is struggling with whether or not he’s gay. She can’t handle that, and at the top of the second act there was a scene where she’s saying how wrong it all is. I was not doing the scene well and I didn’t know why. Then it hit me: I’m afraid that the audience is going to think that I’m like this character. I didn’t want people to think that I was this stuck-up, privileged white girl. But there’s the choice: Do you want the audience to like you or do you want to be a good actor? That’s an easy choice for me.      Do you have sympathy for actors who choose differently?      Certainly in terms of film, there is intense pressure to repeat successful characters. I’ll give you an example, but you mustn’t include her name. [Very famous Hollywood actress] has played the same role for 20 years. She even looks pretty much the same. She’s probably one of the richest women out there, but I would shoot myself if I were like that, only giving people what they expect.      There isn’t really an identifiable “Kathleen Turner”–type character.      And that wasn’t helpful to me in Hollywood. People would say, “God, I love The Accidental Tourist. Oh, you also were in Undercover Blues? That was great! And Prizzi’s Honor? Shit, you were in that too.” They never put my work together because I wasn’t doing the same thing over and over, which, by the way, wasn’t good for me financially.      Which actors are you excited about right now?      On the whole, I’m very ignorant, but I like Emma Stone. And the stage actress Nina Arianda is incredible. She’s got the power, babe.      I have another question about actors and their choices: When you show up on set, like you did for Peggy Sue Got Married, and realize that Nicolas Cage has decided to play his part with such an unusual voice — that he was doing a thing — how did that affect how you calibrated your performance?      It was tough to not say, “Cut it out.” But it wasn’t my job to say to another actor what he should or shouldn’t do. So I went to [director] Francis [Ford Coppola]. I asked him, “You approved this choice?” It was very touchy. He [Nicolas Cage] was very difficult on set. But the director allowed what Nicolas wanted to do with his role, so I wasn’t in a position to do much except play with what I’d been given. If anything, it [Cage’s portrayal] only further illustrated my character’s disillusionment with the past. The way I saw it was, yeah, he was that asshole.      Sorry, Nicolas Cage or his character?      Listen, I made it work, honey.      From a performance standpoint how much easier is it to act with someone when there’s no interpersonal tension? Was working with Michael Douglas, whom you liked, easier than working with Burt Reynolds, whom you didn’t? Or do your personal feelings for the other actor just not matter?      Working with Burt Reynolds was terrible. The first day Burt came in he made me cry. He said something about not taking second place to a woman. His behavior was shocking. It never occurred to me that I wasn’t someone’s equal. I left the room sobbing. I called my husband and said, “I don’t know what to do.” He said, “You just do the job.” It got to be very hostile because the crew began taking sides. But as for the performance, I was able to put the negativity aside. I’m not convinced Burt was.      Is there anyone from your cohort of film actresses — I’m thinking of women like Sigourney Weaver, Debra Winger, or Meryl Streep — whose trajectory you’ve found particularly inspiring or interesting?      It seems to me that we’ve all made good lives for ourselves. Surely that’s as important as what credits we all have. I will say that I miss Meryl onstage. I remember seeing her in The Taming of the Shrew many years ago. She charged out on stage swinging a footstool. I was like, “Oh yeah!” — I loved the energy of it. I wish she would do more stage work. But we’ve all matured into interesting women, yeah? That’s the important thing. I’m very interested in women’s growth as people. You know, I work with an organization called Young Elected Officials, and I teach women how not to compromise and I work with them on their self-presentation. I tell them, “If you say ‘like’ one more time I will kick you!”      Did you ever kick a co-star?      No. I slapped one.      Who?      He bit me.      Go on.      I was doing a play — there was a scene where another actor was all over my character and fuckin’ bit me, and I was like, whack! Maybe he didn’t mean to, but he was taking things a little far.      Do you believe there are better roles for women in theater than in film?      The roles for mature women onstage are a thousand times better than anything written in film. The screen roles are usually stereotypes: the evil stepmother, the bitter spinster. Whereas in theater there’s Martha or Mother Courage — I could name many characters I’d love to do. That’s why, knowing where my career could grow as I got less desirable for the camera, I focused on theater. I remember I got sent a screenplay once where the character was described as “37 but still attractive.” That pissed me off. Americans are so screwed up about sex.      This is a sort of left-field question, but President Trump seems like someone you would’ve bumped into at a party in New York in the ’80s. Have you ever met him?      Yes. Yuck. He has this gross handshake.      What’s he do?      He goes to shake your hand and with his index finger kind of rubs the inside of your wrist. He’s trying to do some kind of seductive intimacy move. You pull your hand away and go yuck.      Thank you for indulging the question. Anyway, there’s a part in your autobiography where you talk about how playing different roles allows you to learn about different parts of yourself. What do you learn when you do something like your cabaret show, where you’re not playing a character?      Even though I’m not playing a character, I am playing a version of myself. And there are basic qualities I want to convey: the sense of loving people, of loving to be onstage, of loving to communicate. I’ve always felt that people had affection for me and my work, and doing the cabaret shows has helped me understand why.      And what’s the reason?      I’m a really nice person.      Didn’t Eileen Atkins call you a “nightmare”? What was that about?      It’s two-sided. Eileen could be extremely difficult. I spoke to Maggie Smith about my problems with Eileen and Maggie said, “It wasn’t you.” But at the time we were working on Indiscretions, Eileen was soon to be diagnosed with cancer. She probably knew there was something wrong with her and was frightened. Also at that time I was on a new medication that was making me fuzzy, and for the first time in my life I couldn’t retain the script perfectly. I would find myself searching for words. Eileen found this extremely unprofessional. I can understand that. It was not intentional on my part. I was in a great deal of pain — I don’t know how I got through it. One of the areas that was most painful was my right wrist. Just touching it would make me want to scream. It’s hard to understand the level of pain that this disease [rheumatoid arthritis] brings. In any case, I would say to the cast on some nights, “Tonight is really bad. Please avoid this wrist.” And on those nights when Eileen particularly disapproved of me, during a scene where I was supposed to be dead she would …      Oh no.      Sit right on my wrist. I would just lie there, trying not to gasp. Oh, it was a very confusing time. I didn’t know that it was the medication that was keeping me fuzzy. But, you know, even that — I don’t think anyone’s attitude toward me was coming from a cynical place.      You didn’t think any of the press about your being “difficult” or your drinking or your illness was cynical?      The “difficult” thing was pure gender crap. If a man comes on set and says, “Here’s how I see this being done,” people go, “He’s decisive.” If a woman does it, they say, “Oh, fuck. There she goes.”      What’s an example of that happening to you?      Here’s one that was very nicely resolved with Francis [Ford Coppola]: Sometimes at night I dream the scene I’m going to be doing the next day, and with Peggy Sue I had dreamed a scene where my character was coming down the stairs in the old house and meets her mother. In my dream the camera was there. When I got on set, the camera was here. I was disoriented. I said to Francis, “The camera’s supposed to be over there” — because that’s how I’d dreamed it — and he went, “No, it’s not.” I said, “I’m telling you it should be over there.” He goes, “Well, it’s over here.” So we made a deal.      What was the deal?      He said that if I gave him as many takes as he wanted from where he had set the camera, he would give me two takes from where I wanted the camera. And guess what happened?      The take he used was from your spot?      Damn right.      But what about when your career took a dip in the ’90s? You don’t think the way that was covered by journalists was coming from a cynical place? They were pretty mean to you.      Well, that had so much to do with the rheumatoid arthritis. At that time there was very little public knowledge about autoimmune diseases, so my illness was a source of bad mystery — certainly compared to what was going on with, oh, for example Robert Downey Jr.      I don’t quite follow the comparison.      Someone like him could show up on set and be drunk or misbehave in some way, but he would still get hired because producers figured they could control that kind of behavior. But if you say, “I have a mysterious illness and I don’t know if I’ll be able to walk tomorrow” — you’re not getting hired. And the only real effective treatment back then was massive doses of steroids, which has massive side effects. If I went to pick up a bottle, for example, I couldn’t grip it, and people would assume I was inebriated.      At what point did drinking become a real problem and not just a falsely perceived one?      In truth, I did have a period when I found that alcohol was a great painkiller. For some reason, which I do not understand, I thought I could control the pain of my illness better with alcohol than I could with pain medication. I didn’t want to take OxyContin and Percocet. I thought that would be an immediate path to addiction; I never thought alcohol would. Then I did, of course, abuse it [alcohol]. It never got in the way of the work but, oh, on my time off, just to kill the fucking pain, drinking was great.      It’s under control now?      Yes. Now it’s sharing a glass of wine at the end of a show or something — an occasional pleasure.      You know, when I went back and watched The War of the Roses, it was amazing to be reminded how savage and perverse that movie is. And it was a hit. Was Hollywood making riskier movies in the ’80s?      You know, they tried to neuter The War of the Roses. The Fox suits came in toward the end of the filming and said, “Kathleen and Michael, you can’t die.” They wanted us to film an ending where the chandelier falls, our characters are on the ground, and then we’re loaded into two ambulances that pull away in different directions — to leave open the possibility that our characters were alive. Come on. The studio was up against me and Michael [Douglas] and Danny [DeVito]. We just told them we wouldn’t shoot the ending they wanted.      But are mainstream Hollywood films less sophisticated than when you were starring in them?      Gosh, the last film I went to, every trailer was a Marvel comic movie or a shoot-’em-up. It was all guns and superheroes. I just thought, Why isn’t someone doing something different? I would think that whoever could offer an alternative would make a killing. I imagine that’s what television does so well now.      You’ve done a handful of television. To pick one show you guest-starred on: What stands out about your experience on Friends?      I’ll be quite honest, which is my wont: I didn’t feel very welcomed by the cast. I remember I was wearing this difficult sequined gown — and my high heels were absolutely killing me. I found it odd that none of the actors thought to offer me a seat. Finally it was one of the older crew members that said, “Get Miss Turner a chair.” The Friends actors were such a clique — but I don’t think my experience with them was unique. I think it was simply that they were such a tight little group that nobody from the outside mattered.      How did you find them as actors and actresses?      I won’t comment on that.      That’s where you draw a line?      [Laughs.] Maybe if I’d had months to work with them, I’d be in a better position to evaluate their skill. But I could only judge based on the period I worked on the show, which wasn’t long. I do respect the camaraderie they had. You can see camaraderie on the screen. When I did Body Heat with Larry Kasdan and Bill Hurt, we rehearsed significantly before shooting and there was a familiarity before the camera rolled. You see it in the film.      I read in your memoir that William Hurt was into magic mushrooms. Did he ever try and get you to take them with him?      No, I never tried any of those things that he liked. Bill can be very odd.      How so?      I remember one night while we were shooting Body Heat we were sitting around, and for some reason he wanted to talk about how we’d each like to die. I don’t remember what my answer was, but he said he wanted to be sucked up into a jet engine. You would find yourself in that kind of discussion with Bill. Then when we did The Accidental Tourist, Bill was sober, so there were fewer discussions like that. God, you did not want to get Bill talking too much.      Just to go back to working with Michael Douglas. You did three movies with him. How quickly was it apparent that you played off each other so well? Is that something you realize as it’s happening or are you only aware of it later, when you see it onscreen?      Well, you can’t tell on the first day. With Michael, and Danny [DeVito], too, I think they saw me as one of the guys, you know? I was willing to throw myself down mountainsides. And when we did the sequel, Jewel of the Nile, the sense of coming back together was so cool. It was nice to be back with friends.      Were you surprised or hurt at the way Michael leaned on you to do that movie?      That was a bad blowup. I had signed a contract to do a sequel [to Romancing the Stone] but the script for it [The Jewel of the Nile] was terrible. What had happened was that Romancing was so successful that Diane [Thomas], who wrote the original script, evidently asked Michael for what he felt was a ridiculous sum to work on the sequel. So instead, he went with these two guys and what they came up with was terrible, formulaic, sentimental. Anyway, I said no. Then I found out I was being sued for 25 million [for breach of contract]. My position was that, yes, I signed up for a sequel but I didn’t sign up to compromise the quality of my work. Eventually Michael and I talked.      How’d that go?      He said, “What would it take for you to do this film?” I wanted Diane back, or at least to give input. And Michael did go to her for some alterations. But ultimately I read the script on a plane to Morocco, where the film was shooting, and I was furious. It didn’t have what Michael said it’d have. When I got to the hotel in Fez, Michael and I sat down on the floor with three versions of the script. We were trading pages to get a script that was acceptable to both of us. It was, “I’ll do this if you’ll do that.” It was frustrating. But I do have to say, when I got sick Danny and Michael called and said, “If you need anything, kid …” So they’re true friends.      Have you seen a change in the kind of acting popular in Hollywood over the years? Or the kind of acting that appeals to students in your master classes?      I have a confession to make.      Yes?      I never really studied acting. People talk about these different techniques — Meisner, all this stuff. I don’t know what they’re talking about most of the time. My acting school was acting. One year, when I was at Southwest Missouri State University, there were only 14 nights out of an entire year that I was not in rehearsal or in performance. I just did it. In fact, the master classes I do, my course is called Practical Acting. You shut up and do it.      What do you think about the approach of actors like Dustin Hoffman or Daniel Day-Lewis, who famously do all this intense in-character preparation in order to play a role?      In Crimes of Passion I was playing a designer by day, 50 whore on Hollywood Boulevard by night. Do you think I was going to hang out with whores on Hollywood Boulevard and find out what the fuck that was like? I have an imagination, you know. My belief is that all the information I need is in the script. And if it’s not, then it’s not a good enough script.      How often do you get recognized for your voice?      More often than by my looks. I’ll be on the subway and I keep my mouth shut, because if I’m silent, I’m just another person. If I speak, heads turn in my direction.      How much of that recognition is due to Jessica Rabbit?      I don’t know. I think my voice has taken on a persona of its own. It was always low and it’s only gotten lower. But my voice is an asset. I was not born to be an ingénue. I played one once — it was Nina in The Seagull — and I was terrible. I’m rather thrilled with my voice.      At this point in your life and career, what would be a dream role for you?      I have a very exciting idea about how to do Lear. Usually when women play Lear, the daughters are rewritten to be sons. I’d keep them as women. When Lear says to Goneril, “May your womb dry up” — you understand what I mean, yeah?      It’s a very different line if delivered by a mother to her daughter.      Devastating! “May your womb dry up” from a man? So what? From a mother? My God. There’s a power to the relationships between women that we don’t examine as much as we should.      You’d referred to your 50s as your “fuck it” 50s.      The fuck you 50s. I did what I wanted.      How do your 60s feel?      Sixty freaked me out. When I turned 60, I was doing a show on the West End with Ian McDiarmid. I thought, I’m turning 60. I deserve a good ring. And I went out and I bought myself this ring that says, “La vita è un dono”: life is a gift. Yes, 60 felt different. My mother — I was back in Missouri visiting her and she turned to me and said, “I have a 60-year-old daughter.” I was like, “Holy shit.” Suddenly I was a 60-year-old daughter. It was strange.      In a good way?      In an interesting way. I’m a tree now where the trunk is strong enough, and the roots are deep enough, that I can branch out in any direction: teaching, acting, my cabaret endeavor. And I’m getting stronger all the time. So let’s find out what I can do.      This interview was edited and condensed from two conversations.

Turner, known best for her iconic smoky voice, dished Hollywood dirt on everything from the cast of Friends, to Elizabeth Taylor's voice and Donald Trump's handshake in the wide-ranging interview.      Here are six of the biggest talking points from the piece.      1. On \\"rage\\" and sexism      Asked by journalist David Marchese what had driven her career aside from luck, Turner responded simply with \\"rage\\".      Pushed further, the actress replied: \\"I'm [expletive] angry, man\\" about \\"everything\\" and \\"injustice in the world\\".      The interviewer then presses her on whether this stems from her career being derailed by illness.      \\"I suppose there was a feeling of loss. Rheumatoid arthritis hit in my late 30s - the last of my years in which Hollywood would consider me a sexually appealing leading lady,\\" she told the magazine.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Turner became a breakthrough star in the erotic thriller Body Heat in 1981      \\"The hardest part was that so much of my confidence was based on my physicality. If I didn't have that, who was I?\\"      She later takes aim at accusations she was \\"difficult\\" to work with on set.      \\"If a man comes on set and says, 'Here's how I see this being done,' people go 'He's decisive'. If a woman does it, they say, 'Oh [expletive], there she goes'.\\"      2. On refusing to be typecast      She discusses resisting playing one type of role, saying actors have a choice between wanting audiences to like them and becoming skilled.      Turner takes aim at one unnamed actress for playing the same role for 20 years.      \\"She even looks pretty much the same. She's probably one of the richest women out there, but I would shoot myself if I were like that, only giving people what they expect.\\"      The internet has been trying to guess who she is talking about since the article was published.      3. On rebuffing advances      In the interview she speaks angrily about feeling like a \\"sexual target\\" and a \\"trophy\\" after her early breakthrough roles.      She says that she always felt insecure in Los Angeles, because of an \\"unspoken assumption\\" in Hollywood \\"that women were property to be claimed\\".      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption She won the Golden Globe for best actress opposite Douglas in Romancing the Stone      Turner says she learned that there had been a competition between actors Michael Douglas, Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty about \\"who would get [her] first\\".      \\"None of them did, by the by,\\" she told Vulture.      4. Taking aim at other A-listers      Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor is one of several big names who come under fire from Turner in the interview.      She criticises Taylor's performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? saying: \\"I don't think she was very skilled.\\"      Turner describes the actress' voice as \\"awful\\" and \\"badly used\\".      She also takes aim at Nicolas Cage for his work alongside her on the set of Peggy Sue Got Married, released in 1986.      \\"He was very difficult on set. But the director allowed what Nicolas wanted to do with his role, so I wasn't in a position to do much except play with what I'd been given,\\" she said.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Turner said it was tough not to tell Cage to stop playing his part with an unusual voice      \\"If anything, it [Cage's portrayal] only further illustrated my character's disillusionment with the past. The way I saw it was, yeah, he was that [expletive].\\"      Asked to elaborate on whether she meant the comment toward Cage or his character, she responded: \\"Listen, I made it work, honey.\\"      She also said that working with Burt Reynolds in 1988 was \\"terrible\\" and his actions on set made her cry.      \\"His behaviour was shocking. It never occurred to me that I wasn't someone's equal. I left the room sobbing,\\" she said.      Turner also says she once slapped a male co-star in a theatre production who had bitten her, but doesn't reveal who.      5. The Friends cast apparently weren't very friendly      Turner, who guest starred as Chandler's father in hit US sitcom Friends, said she \\"didn't feel very welcomed by the cast\\" on set.      Image copyright Warner Bros via Getty Images Image caption Turner said none of the cast offered her a seat when she was struggling in a difficult outfit and high heels      \\"The Friends actors were such a clique - but I don't think my experience with them was unique,\\" she said.      \\"I think it was simply that they were such a tight little group that nobody from the outside mattered.\\"      6. On Donald Trump's handshake      Asked whether she ever bumped into Mr Trump in the 1980s, Turner responded: \\"Yes. Yuck. He has this gross handshake.\\"      She elaborated: \\"He goes to shake your hand and with his index finger kind of rubs the inside of your wrist. He's trying to do some kind of seductive intimacy move. You pull your hand away and go yuck.\\"      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kathleen Turner pictured with Mr Trump at the D W Griffith Awards in New York in 1988      Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Giving tasteful compliments about a guy's appearance is one thing, but creeping a guy out with rude or suggestive comments about his body is another entirely. Though many guys may be reluctant to show it, their feelings may even by hurt by you objectifying them. Don't make a guy feel like a piece of meat — though this is advice you'll usually hear given to men regarding women, it's just as true the other way around.  Objectification happens when you take a person's appearance as representation of their whole being. This is especially when these attributes should be irrelevant to the situation.  Though sparing a guy's feelings should be enough of a reason not to objectify him, there's another reason you shouldn't do it that's more immediate: you can get in trouble. In fact, if your creepy come-ons or unwanted compliments are severe enough, they can constitute harassment, which is a major offense at school or in the workplace and lead to serious repercussions. There are a huge range of topics that are acceptable subjects for compliments, so don't make the mistake of choosing one that's off-limits. In general, you'll want to avoid complimenting guys on things that are very personal or which have strong emotions attached to them, unless you're very close to him.  This advice is especially true if other people are present — while it may sometimes be OK to bring up personal topics in one-on-one settings, you'll almost never want to do it in front of his friends. Taboo compliments will vary from place to place. It can be considered offensive to compliment a man on his wife. Your compliments should be all about building the guy up, not about subtly tearing him down or making yourself feel better at his expense. Try not to give backhanded compliments — compliments that contain a thinly-veiled insult or a compliment to yourself. Not only are they rude, but also generally quite obvious, so they can easily end up making you look like a jerk in social situations.  Here's an example of a backhanded compliment: \\"Hey, did you get a new shirt?  It makes you look thinner.\\" It may seem like you're complimenting him, but you're also saying he normally looks fat. Research suggests that people are more likely to take these expressions as backhanded when they perceive the person giving the compliment has some insight into what is normal. Don’t use a canned line. Ridiculous pickup lines can be great fun if you're just playing around, but they're terrible if you're genuinely trying to compliment someone. Remember, the best compliments are sincere ones, so, unless this person has really \\"been running through your head all day\\", you're probably hurting your chances with these sorts of lines. Don’t compliment him on something you’re unsure about. If you're wrong about your assumption, you may offend him or hit a sensitive nerve, so it's usually best to play it safe and wait. Here are just a few examples of potentially \\"dangerous\\" situations where you should tread lightly:  His appearance has recently changed (e.g., he has recently lost a lot of weight in a short time) You haven't seen him in a long time and aren't sure how his life has changed You don't know his relationship status You aren't sure how he feels about current events (e.g. in the field of politics, etc.)","output":"This article explains the importance of giving appropriate compliments to guys without objectifying them or making them feel uncomfortable, and suggests that avoiding personal topics, backhanded compliments, and assumptions can help make compliments sincere and well-received."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival?, using the article: Agrippina (HWV 6) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised  the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The first name of the person who had an ongoing revival is George, referring to the composer George Frideric Handel. He composed the opera seria Agrippina, which has been increasingly popular in the ongoing Handel revival, with modern critical opinion considering it his first operatic masterpiece."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: In this task, you are given two strings A, B. Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. Input: fEcbrYeeIwdK, junbrYeeIqGVEI Output:","output":"Part #1: Understand the input Usage: In the given example, the input is two strings \\"fEcbrYeeIwdK\\" and \\"junbrYeeIqGVEI\\". The instruction implies that you will need to process these two strings. The given strings are the data you will use in the main operation (finding the longest common substring). Part #2: Understand what a substring is Usage: A substring is a consecutive sequence of characters occurring in a string. For instance, in the string \\"apple\\", \\"app\\", \\"ple\\", \\"p\\", and \\"le\\" are all substrings. For this step in the task, understand that substrings are not the complete string but parts of it, and they always maintain the order of the characters as they appear in the original string. Part #3: Understand what a common substring is Usage: A common substring between two strings is a substring that occurs in both strings. For instance, in the strings \\"fEcbrYeeIwdK\\" and \\"junbrYeeIqGVEI\\", \\"brYeeI\\" is a common substring. It appears in both strings. So, at this step, your task is to identify all such substrings that are present in both the provided strings. Part #4: Find the longest common substring Usage: In the strings \\"fEcbrYeeIwdK\\" and \\"junbrYeeIqGVEI\\", \\"brYeeI\\" is the longest common substring. There might be multiple common substrings, but \\"brYeeI\\" has the most characters. Thus, the final step is to identify which of the common substrings from the previous step is the longest one. The important criteria here are both the presence in both strings and the length of the substring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two chambers are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks to work out the differences between their bills, negotiations which could effectively override Trump's move to cut pay.

At time zero a new type of atomic explosion, a plutonium bomb, will be detonated at Desert Rock, Nevada. These soldiers are to experience the Plutonium Explosion under simulated combat conditions.\\" Credits roll.Over a loudspeaker the troops are warned that in thirty seconds the explosion will happen. The countdown is started, but when zero is announced there is no explosion.

Glenn Manning (Glenn Langan), on the phone with control, tells the soldiers around him they will need to wait. Manning, again on the phone, reports a civilian plane in the area and it seems to be in trouble. It crashes and Manning, against orders, runs out to render assistance.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Matthew is an American exchange student who has come to Paris to study French. While at the Cinémathèque Française protesting the firing of Henri Langlois, he meets the free-spirited twins Théo and Isabelle. The three bond over a shared love of film. After dinner with their parents, Théo and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends. Matthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Théo loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a Marlene Dietrich poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers. Matthew begins to accept Théo and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three re-enact a famous scene from Bande à part by \\"breaking the world record for running through the Louvre\\", and Matthew and Théo engage in playful arguments about Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the subject of Maoism, which Théo fervently believes in.  During this time Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Théo. Matthew and Isabelle leave the house and go on a regular date, which she has not experienced before. Théo retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle.

Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games.

Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people. They might have trouble sharing and resolving problems because they do not practice these shills when sitting alone at a computer. Another problem is about health. Game players usually sit for hours without doing any exercise. And they might not eat healthily. As a result, they might be out of shape. Next, game players might have trouble with their lessons.

BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). Identify the weight you would like to be in kilograms and then divide that by your height in meters to see if it is healthy. You can also use a BMI calculator, such as the one on the NIH’s website: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm Increase or decrease that goal weight so that it fits within the BMI range considered healthy:  A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is a normal or healthy weight. A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese. Along with finding a healthy weight, also realize what is realistic. If you are 100 lb away from your healthy body weight with only a month before summer, consider setting a smaller, more attainable goal. The more calories you cut back, the more weight you will lose; however, it is important that you do not eat less than your Basal Metabolic Rate, the amount of calories your body needs to function effectively when at rest. This number can be calculated using an online BMR calculator. In general, don't aim to lose more than one to two pounds per week. A loss of one to two pounds per week is a healthy rate at which to lose weight; any more than this could be too drastic a change and may signify that your body is not getting what it needs. To do this, try to eat 250 fewer calories per day and burn an extra 250 calories a day. This ratio will create enough of a calorie deficit that you should lose one pound per week. During the summertime, you are surrounded by opportunities to eat, whether it’s at a barbecue, pool party, ice cream party, or summer luau. However, if you want to lose weight over the summer, it's important that you cut back on the number of calories you eat. As a general rule, weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume.  To help figure out how many calories you normally eat each day, track your food for a day by writing down the number of calories in everything you eat and drink. Calories are listed on the back of food labels. For foods that do not have labels, you can find information about the caloric value of certain foods online through the USDA Food Database.  Pay attention to the number of servings you eat and multiply this by the number of calories per serving. For example, if you ate 30 chips and a serving size is 15 chips, you need to multiply the number of calories by two since you ate two servings. Once you have figured out how many calories you normally eat, cut down this number by 500-1000 calories per day to lose weight. In this log, record what you eat and the type and duration of exercise you're doing every day. This is a simple yet very powerful tool to keep yourself accountable. The log will help you track your progress and see whether you are keeping to your healthy diet and exercise regimen.  This is a wonderful way to hold yourself accountable and stay on track. There are many apps for smart phones that have capabilities to track food intake, energy expenditure, water intake and more! Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead think our diet is not working. Studies have shown that most people underestimate how much they eat by 25 percent.  In addition, many of us think we get more exercise and burn more calories than we do. Use the log to identify how many calories your exercise—whether it be a run on the treadmill or a spin on the bike—is burning. If you use cardio machines at a gym, the number of calories is usually digitally calculated and displayed. Make sure to put in your particulars, such as weight and age, to achieve an accurate count. There are also online charts that can help tell you how many calories a half hour or an hour of a given exercise burns. You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume and burn off through exercise. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress. Find a partner—whether that be a spouse, friend, or family member—who wants to join you during outdoor activities, hit the gym with you, or join your healthy eating plan. Having social support will make it easier to lose weight because the other person will also keep you accountable and be a sounding board for any obstacles and struggles you face along the way. If you cannot find a friend or partner to help you with your weight loss journey, utilizing the services of a personal trainer or registered dietitian will keep you accountable and help you stay active and eat healthy. A trainer can also be a huge support system. Think outside of the box for your support system! Always consult your physician before beginning any type of weight loss and/or exercise program. You should also consult your physician throughout your weight loss program and keep him updated of any changes or symptoms you may be experiencing, such as constipation thanks to your new diet plan or lethargy due to not getting enough food. In addition, you should also talk to your doctor if you are eating well, tracking your calories and watching what you eat, exercising, and are still not losing weight. This could be indicative of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a thyroid problem. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article talks about finding a healthy weight goal using a measurement called BMI (Body Mass Index) and making realistic plans to lose weight.

A: Pick your answer from: (i). inner; (ii). angular; (iii). outer; (iv). convex; Answer:","output":"A microscope can be made from two convex lenses. In a basic microscope setup, two types of convex lenses are used to create a magnified image of a small object. These lenses are called the objective lens and the eyepiece lens.  The objective lens is the lens closest to the object being observed, and it's responsible for providing the primary image enlargement. The objective lens collects the light from the object being examined and forms a real, inverted image that is then magnified by the eyepiece lens. A series of objective lenses with different magnification powers may be included in a microscope to provide various levels of magnification. The eyepiece lens is the lens located closest to the user's eye, and it is responsible for further magnifying the image formed by the objective lens. The eyepiece lens converts the real, inverted image generated by the objective lens into a virtual, magnified image that can be seen by the user. By adjusting the distance between the eyepiece lens and the objective lens, the user can fine-tune the focus and obtain a clear, enlarged image of the object being observed. Convex lenses are the ideal choice for both the objective and eyepiece lenses in a microscope because of their ability to refract light and form magnified images. These lenses are thicker at the center than at the edges, causing light rays to converge as they pass through the lens. In a microscope, the proper arrangement of convex lenses allows them to focus light on a specific point, magnify the object's image, and provide a clear, enlarged view of the sample under examination. In summary, microscopes are typically made using two convex lenses - the objective lens and the eyepiece lens - which together create a magnified image of a small object. This design enables users to examine and study various objects at increased magnification levels, making microscopes invaluable tools in various scientific fields such as biology, chemistry, geology, and materials science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Why can't some people even get an inch of what they dream of becoming? Blame it on pure dreaming and lack of surrounding goals for achieving their dreams. Setting goals is very significant part of accomplishing and positive actions. It is like scaling  a 200 feet construction and marking in the early hours on what feet you would like to reach at this specific period. People who set goals literally generate a map of their goal settings in life, marking where they should start, where to pause, where to study a bit, and where and when to end. Once this map comes into being, it allows the map drawer to check where he is in the scheme  of things and whether or not he is making some planning that will take him closer to his goals. By surrounding goals, people will know how they are doing and what they should be doing to get their goals or dreams in life. They will know if they can relax or if they have to double their efforts when they are falling short of what is expected of them. Goal surroundings means a person is prepared in dealing with challenges that may affect his plans. Being proactive means one is able to outline possible difficulties that may occur as well as the solutions to these difficulties. By doing this, a person is not easily scared or defeated when challenges occur because he has already prepared for them. He knows they can happen and he has prepared a solution or strategy when that time comes. Setting goals will enable people to track their progress in whatever hard work they set out to do. It will help people become more confident in themselves and more motivated to get their plans. Question: The purpose of this passage is to   _  .

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the man inside the jaguar cage? , can you please find it?   A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole. Oswald climbs up the pole and grabs the ceiling for his safety. One of the acrobats also goes up the pole and clings onto the rabbit's legs. Bothered by having someone hanging under him, Oswald grabs a mallet and strikes off the acrobat. Oswald plunges down and drops on the jaguar. The jaguar is angered more than ever and the frightened Oswald flees the stage.","output":"The article does not explicitly mention the name of the man inside the jaguar cage.

Please answer the following question: -  The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process leading to an earthquake is the development of cracks or faults in the earth's crust due to the constant movement and shifting of tectonic plates. These tectonic plates are massive sections of the earth's lithosphere that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below, and their movements can produce tension, compression, or shear forces in the crust. Over time, these forces gradually cause stress to accumulate in rocks, which may result in the formation of cracks or faults. In the presence of significant stress, the rocks will begin to deform and eventually fracture along the weakest points, leading to the creation of these cracks or fault lines. As more stress continues to accumulate, the cracks grow longer and larger, allowing for more movement and eventually reaching a critical point where the two sides of the fault start to slip past each other. This slip can be sudden and cause displacement of rock formations, both of which contribute to the energy release responsible for generating seismic waves. The surrounding pressure from the earth on both sides of these cracks affects the rate and manner of propagation of the faults. When the pressure becomes too great, the rocks on each side of the cracks press against each other with tremendous force, exacerbating the fault movement. This movement, combined with continued stress and the development of the cracks, can cause some rocks to weaken and crumble over time. Once the tension has reached its peak within the fault zone, the stored energy is finally released, giving rise to seismic waves that propagate through the earth's crust and upper mantle. These seismic waves can travel vast distances, depending on various factors like the magnitude of the earthquake, the surrounding rock types, and the depth of the fault rupture. As the waves reach the earth's surface, they cause ground shaking and can result in damage to structures, landforms, and sometimes even lives, depending on the severity and location of the earthquake. In summary, the first step in the process that leads to an earthquake is the formation of cracks or faults in the earth's crust due to the applied stress from tectonic plate movement. This initial development of cracks sets off a chain of events involving increasing pressure, fault propagation, rock displacement, and eventual energy release in the form of seismic waves, culminating in the occurrence of an earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This situation may have arisen due to several contributing factors, each amplifying the auditory chaos that enveloped the vicinity of his residence. Firstly, the neighborhood itself might be closely packed with houses and apartments, fostering a condensed living arrangement where the walls and barriers provide minimal insulation against the sounds produced by the inhabitants. As a consequence, mundane domestic activities like conversing, playing music, or utilizing appliances would reverberate throughout the locale, generating an incessant background noise that could easily overwhelm James's television audio. Moreover, it is highly plausible that large numbers of pedestrians and street traffic contribute to the heightened noise levels in the area. The constant hustle and bustle of people going about their daily lives, running errands, or engaging in conversations could lead to a cacophony of voices and footsteps. Additionally, a busy street with a steady flow of cars, buses, motorcycles, and other vehicles adds another layer of disturbance to the audioscape. The emissions arising from engines, honks, brakes, and steady whooshes of passing automobiles exacerbate the noise pollution affecting James's ability to hear his television clearly. Beyond the immediate residential and street scenarios, James's neighborhood could also be exposed to intrusive noise influxes originating from commercial establishments and ongoing construction work. Restaurants and pubs, usually found in populated areas, might host patrons who partake in lively discussions or even boisterous revelry, generating substantial noise spillage. Similarly, live music venues, nightclubs, or other entertainment options contribute significantly to the din pervading the surroundings. Meanwhile, ongoing construction projects in the vicinity – be it new developments, renovations, or infrastructure improvements – generate hammering, drilling, and machinery noises that could further impede James's efforts to hear his television. Lastly, James's neighborhood might be located near prominent noise sources, such as railroads, airports, or busy highways. The relentless stream of noise generated by trains, planes, or incessant road traffic would ultimately deprive the area of any semblance of peace and quiet. Consequently, the compounded acoustic chaos radiating from these disparate sources would obliterate the possibility of making out the television's audio output amidst the prevailing noise pollution. In conclusion, James's struggle to hear his television in his neighborhood arises from a range of factors that culminate in an inescapable cacophony. To address this issue, he might consider investing in noise-canceling headphones, soundproofing his residence, or opting for alternate entertainment methods like streaming services with subtitles, which can potentially alleviate the frustration caused by his audibility predicament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Throughout history, several notable individuals have studied anatomy as part of their exploration of natural history and scientific literature. In the context provided, the genre of scientific literature experienced significant growth in importance, with natural history becoming increasingly popular among the upper classes during the Enlightenment period. This encompassed various areas of study, including botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy, within which anatomy was a crucial component. One such figure who studied anatomy is Jacques Gautier d'Agoty, a French anatomist, painter, and printmaker. He is best known for his work, La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746), which focuses on providing detailed descriptions of all the muscles in the human body. Through this work, Gautier d'Agoty contributed to the study and understanding of human anatomy, and his methods involved the interdisciplinary exchange of scientific ideas. Another influential contributor to the study of anatomy is René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, a French scientist who devoted his life to the study of natural history. Although his primary focus was on insects and metallurgy, he also touched upon anatomy in the context of natural history. Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes provides valuable insights into the intricate anatomy of insects. In addition to the mentioned individuals, other prominent figures who studied anatomy during the Enlightenment era and beyond include: - Andreas Vesalius: A Flemish anatomist and physician, Vesalius is considered the father of modern anatomy due to his seminal work, De humani corporis fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body), which provided in-depth examinations of human anatomy and revolutionized the study of medicine.    - William Harvey: An English physician, Harvey is well-known for his accurate description of blood circulation and the function of the heart. His work, Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals), laid the foundation for understanding the cardiovascular system. - Albrecht von Haller: A Swiss anatomist, physiologist, and naturalist, Haller studied the anatomy of various animals to better understand the functioning of organs, the nervous system, and the circulatory system. - Marie François Xavier Bichat: A French anatomist and pathologist, Bichat is known for his advancements in the field of tissue pathology. His work, Anatomie générale, appliquée à la physiologie et à la médecine, sought to classify different types of tissue in the human body. During the Enlightenment, universities and academies taught natural history as a key part of education, preparing students for careers in diverse fields such as medicine and theology. The study of anatomy was an essential facet of this interdisciplinary approach that involved collaboration and the exchange of knowledge and ideas.

He is either masochistically neurotic: This suggests that the person in question may have a tendency to engage in self-destructive or self-punishing behaviors, possibly due to underlying psychological issues. 2. Or is figuring out how to extricate himself: This implies that the individual might be trying to find a way to remove himself from the current situation or predicament he is facing. Now, let's examine the follow-up statement: 1. He might be paranoid: This statement introduces a new possibility that the person may be exhibiting excessive or irrational suspiciousness and distrust of others. It doesn't directly correlate with him being masochistically neurotic, but it provides an alternate view of the individual's behavior. However, it is worth noting that paranoia and neuroticism can sometimes coexist in an individual, complicating their psychological profile. 2. But I'm not sure if he is trying to remove himself: This part of the statement shows uncertainty about whether or not the person is attempting to extract himself from the situation. While it references the second part of the initial observation, it introduces doubt and suggests that there might be other explanations for the individual's behavior. In summary, the follow-up statement does follow the initial observation, but it expands upon it by introducing the possibility of paranoia and expressing some uncertainty about whether the individual is actually trying to remove himself from the situation. Although it does not directly address the idea of the person being masochistically neurotic, it offers an alternate perspective on the individual's mental state and motivations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A. excited  B. ownership  C. satisfaction  D. being happy  E. disappointment  The best answer is Answer:","output":"E. disappointment When someone knows what presents they will be receiving, and none of them match their desired gifts, it is natural to feel a sense of disappointment. This emotional reaction stems from unmet expectations and hopes, as the person may have been eagerly anticipating the possibility of receiving something they truly wanted. Disappointment can lead to a range of emotions, such as sadness, frustration, or even resentment. In this situation, the other options do not accurately describe the emotions the person would feel after discovering that their gifts are not what they had hoped for. A. Excited: Excitement generally comes from anticipating a positive or desired outcome. In this case, the individual's expectations were not met, so excitement would not be an appropriate emotional response. B. Ownership: This term refers to the act of possessing or controlling something. While the person technically will have ownership of the presents, this does not address the emotional aspect of the situation. C. Satisfaction: Satisfaction is the feeling of contentment, pleasure, or fulfillment that comes from achieving a goal or receiving something desired. In this scenario, the individual's desires were not met, so they would not be experiencing satisfaction. D. Being happy: Happiness is a state of overall well-being and contentment, composed of positive emotions such as joy, amusement, and gratitude. Since the person's wishes were not fulfilled, they are unlikely to feel happiness in this situation. Considering these other options, disappointment is the most accurate description of the person's emotions upon realizing their gifts do not align with their desires. This underscores the importance of understanding and managing expectations and communicating with others about one's wishes and preferences, so as to minimize disappointment in similar situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the U.S. Census data projects that the last of the Baby Boomers will turn 65 in 2029, comprising 16% of the total population, addressing the needs of an aging population has become increasingly important. The AGNES suit is equipped with heavy helmets, neck braces, and yellow-tinged glasses that create the sensation of achy joints, limited mobility, and blurred vision for the wearer. According to MIT AgeLab's Meet AGNES YouTube video, wearing the suit results in increased fatigue, reduced flexibility in joints and muscles, spinal compression, and difficulty with vision and balance, thereby emulating the physical difficulties experienced by many older individuals. By experiencing these challenges firsthand, those involved in designing products or public spaces can better understand the accessibility and usability requirements for an aging population. The video showcases suited young individuals struggling to reach a low supermarket shelf, read medicine labels, and disembark from public buses, highlighting the everyday difficulties faced by older adults. The AGNES suit has the potential to significantly impact the design and development of various products and services tailored for the aging population. By providing wearers with a realistic simulation of old age, designers can gain valuable insights into how to create products that are more user-friendly and accommodating for an older demographic. This innovative approach aims to foster empathy and address the unique needs of an increasingly aging population, promoting a more inclusive society. In summary, the AGNES suit developed by MIT's AgeLab simulates the experience of aging, allowing designers and engineers to better understand the needs and challenges faced by older individuals. By experiencing these difficulties firsthand, they can develop products and services that cater to the specific requirements of an aging population, ultimately promoting a more inclusive and accessible society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You might submit a business proposal in response to receiving an RFP. Large businesses and government agencies send out RFPs when they need goods or services. For example, a business that is being sued may send RFPs to different law firms, asking them to submit a business proposal. Alternately, the government could send out an RFP when they need to buy supplies of a product. The RFP should contain certain information which you must fully understand before drafting your business proposal.  Make sure that you can meet the client’s requirements as spelled out in the RFP. For example, if you can’t come in under the budget or meet the client’s timeline, then you shouldn’t submit a proposal. You don’t need to submit a business proposal in response to an RFP. Instead, you can reach out to a business you think could use your services. You want your business proposal to respond to the client’s actual needs. This means fully understanding the client and clearing up any confusion in the RFP. You should always step into the client’s shoes and try to see the problem from their perspective. To help in this process, you should call and get answers to the following:  Whether prior attempts were made to address the problem. Why did they fail? What criteria the client will use when evaluating a business proposal. Whether the organization has any concerns. The organization’s operating policies. You want to make sure your proposal is consistent with these policies. You want your business proposal to be readable. This means that the font should be in a size and style that the reader is comfortable with. Generally, you can use Times New Roman 12 point.  You can also look for sample proposals used in your industry. Type “business proposal sample” and then “your industry” into your favorite search engine. There are also business proposal templates online. Using one can make your business proposal look professional. You should have a title page as the cover to your business proposal. The title page should include the following information:  your name your company’s name the name of the person you are submitting the proposal to the date you submitted the proposal A business proposal identifies a problem and proposes a solution. Accordingly, you should begin by identifying the client’s problem in simple and clear language. Explain why the current situation is a problem for the client. For example, you could write, “Mathis Gyms is in need of Accounting and Payroll Services as the business continues to grow and hires more employees. Currently, all accounting is done by management, which must devote increasing amounts of time to accounting. By outsourcing this task, management can focus on other business priorities, such as marketing and entering new markets.” You might need to explain context so that the reader understands the proposal. For example, you may need to identify the following for the reader:  If any previous solutions have been attempted and failed. Whether someone asked you to write the business proposal. How you became involved in the project or aware of the problem. Although your business proposal should be written in simple and clear language, there may be terms that you need to define for the reader. Remember that you might submit your business proposal to a purchasing department that understands industry jargon. However, the person who makes the ultimate decision might not be as familiar with industry terms.  You can draft the business proposal first and then go through to identify any terms that might be unclear to the reader. Also define terms if you are using them in a unique way. For example, the term “fiscal year” can be defined in many ways, depending on the business. If you have a long business proposal, then you might want to offer an overview of what follows the introduction. You could summarize the parts that follow. For example, you could write, “This business proposal has four parts. After this introduction, we offer the proposed solution, timetable, and an explanation of benefits in Part II. In Part III, we provide an itemized budget and a set of standard contract terms. Finally, in Part IV, we summarize our experience and confirm that our proposed solution is the correct course of conduct.” Summary:","output":"To submit a business proposal in response to an RFP, follow these steps: 1.

Parker Conrad’s start-up, Zenefits, is thought to be one of the fastest-growing companies in recent Silicon Valley history, and his investors and associates describe him as an uncommonly talented software visionary. But lately, Mr. Conrad often finds himself petrified, his days a series of white-knuckled attempts to escape the clutches of sudden, inadvertent failure. “We’re obviously growing very quickly, but I can tell you that that is just as scary as the other way around,” Mr. Conrad said during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in San Francisco, a space so crowded with newly hired staff members that it was hard to find a room in which to chat. “It doesn’t feel like we’re successful,” he said. “It feels like we’re bouncing from one terrifying near-catastrophe to the next.” Open self-doubt is an unusual posture for a start-up executive. Tech founders are, as a class, known to be drunk on their own hype. But Mr. Conrad doesn’t quite fit the stereotype of the young, hyperconfident brogrammer now reported to be running, and ruining, the tech industry. Though he looks the part — he has a boyish face and favors casual, gamer-guy attire — he is, at 34, relatively old. And while the tech press is consumed by apps like Uber and Airbnb, companies that wear their regulation-smashing, world-changing zeal on their sleeves, Zenefits is unusual in that makes software designed to help small businesses comply with regulations rather than fight them. After a bout with testicular cancer a decade ago — from which he has recovered — Mr. Conrad became a self-taught expert on the byzantine particulars of the American health care market, and he is an ardent supporter of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s health reform law. Two years ago, after getting pushed out of his last job, Mr. Conrad realized that the new law was creating an opportunity for a start-up to remake the way small businesses buy health insurance. That process has been derided as needlessly complex, inefficient, opaque and antiquated. It is also extremely lucrative: The national health insurance brokerage market on which Mr. Conrad set his sights is worth, by one estimate, 18 billion. Zenefits didn’t set out to become a health insurance broker. Instead, Mr. Conrad found that the health care market could make for a lucrative business model. Zenefits produces web-based software for small businesses to manage their human resources operations. It gives companies that software free, but if they decide to buy health insurance for their workers through Zenefits’ software, Zenefits receives a substantial payment from insurance companies. Investors praise the model for simplifying the process of managing employee benefits, and the legal requirements that come with them. “It’s the ultimate entrepreneur tool,” said Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which, with another venture capital firm, Institutional Venture Partners, invested 66.5 million in Zenefits this summer; that investment valued Zenefits at 500 million. “How do you deal with anything that is very complicated that you need to learn about to be in business? Are you really going to go learn about the Affordable Care Act? Probably not. Once you have Zenefits, that’s it. You’re compliant.” Customers seem to agree. Zenefits signed up 2,000 small businesses that employ a combined 50,000 workers in just its first year of operation, the company says. Last December, 15 people worked for Zenefits; it now employs 220. Mr. Conrad expects that number to triple within a year. Jules Maltz, a partner at I.V.P., said this of the company: “We’ve invested in 18 software-as-a-service companies, and these guys are in a different league. When you compare some of the largest cloud companies to where they were at this age, Zenefits is growing way faster.” If Mr. Conrad harbors much confidence about his firm’s prospects, he doesn’t show it. In conversation, his self-effacing attitude may come off at first as false modesty. But soon you notice that the worry is real. And there are plenty of reasons to worry. Zenefits is betting on certain revenue streams, but the health insurance market is changing rapidly. And as is the case for many early-stage companies, getting the first customers is the easy part. Zenefits could prove to be a truly disruptive force, or it could collapse under the weight of its own ambitions. “The problems that other companies have a year to figure out, we have like eight weeks,” Mr. Conrad said. “It’s incredibly scary. I feel like it takes years off my life.” If you work at a large company, you’ve most likely used some kind of web-based human resources system to gain access to your benefits and to track your paychecks. Small-business owners and their workers, by contrast, have never been well served by software. When you’re hired by a small company, your boss usually has to submit your personal information to a half dozen or more separate systems of record: payroll, health care, retirement, time-tracking, commuter benefits and on and on. When you marry, have a baby, get a promotion or leave the company, all of those systems have to be adjusted. Often, these transactions occur offline: Someone has to fill out a health insurance change-of-status form, fax it in and call later to make sure the changes went through. Mr. Conrad felt this pain firsthand. In 2007, he and a college classmate, Mike Sha, founded a portfolio management start-up that eventually was called SigFig. “I ended up being the guy who had to deal with all this H.R. stuff at the company,” Mr. Conrad said, “and it was an amount of time that I deeply resented.” In 2012, after a falling-out with Mr. Sha, Mr. Conrad was forced out from SigFig. He began looking for something to do, and H.R. software quickly emerged as the most obvious choice. His vision was simple and elegant: What small businesses needed was a single online tool to track all employee records. This software would connect to every benefits provider, so that when your boss wanted to give you a raise, she would type your new salary into the software, and it would handle the changes in all your information with every other service provider online. Mr. Conrad sought to turn a company’s human resources busywork into the sort of one-step, paperless operation we’ve come to expect from most other parts of our app-driven, on-demand world. Building such a system would be tricky, but not impossible. Mr. Conrad cajoled Laks Srini, a software engineer he knew from SigFig, into becoming his co-founder. Mr. Srini would be responsible for coding the new app. While that proved to be a devilishly complex tech problem, the more challenging task for Zenefits was to find a business model. The software that Mr. Conrad envisioned would be expensive to create and market. But small businesses don’t generally have a lot of money to pay for fancy, all-in-one software, which is why few companies had gone after that market. So how would his idea make any money? Late in 2012, Mr. Conrad began meeting with people in Silicon Valley to figure out how to pay for his plan. One of them was Bob Kocher, an investor at the venture firm Venrock, who is also a medical doctor and a health care policy expert. In the first years of the Obama administration, Dr. Kocher served on the National Economic Council, where he helped draft the Affordable Care Act. Now, during a series of lunches, Mr. Conrad and Dr. Kocher began sketching out a plan to dig up an enormous pot of gold buried at the center of the health care industry. That pot of gold is known as the insurance brokerage market. It was worth billions and it was stuck in the past — ruled by handshakes, paper forms and an aversion to most technology built after 1985. When businesses buy health coverage for their workers, they often go through brokers, who play the role that travel agents once did for the airlines. They are middlemen who figure out the best fit between buyers and sellers of health care, then take a percentage of the sale. And the commissions can be quite hefty. After connecting a small business with a health care provider, a broker collects a monthly fee of about 4 to 8 percent of a company’s health premiums. The commission rates are set by care providers and aren’t usually disclosed to the small-business purchasers. But the fees amount to several hundred dollars or more per employee annually, and they generally continue for as long as a business keeps its health coverage. The broker collects the monthly fee from the care provider even if the business never talks to its broker again. “I was thinking, wait a minute, that is a ton of money, and these guys don’t do very much for it,” Mr. Conrad said. This presented an obvious business model for Zenefits. It would become a broker itself. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance providers now publish set rates. This meant that Zenefits could offer brokerage online, letting small businesses buy health insurance pretty much the same way people shop for airline tickets. Becoming a broker was not a trivial process. Brokers need to be licensed by states and recognized as legitimate by large health plans. When Zenefits set up in California, its first market, early in 2013, Dr. Kocher called up the chief executives of some of the large health plans to speed up the process for Zenefits. By registering as a broker, Zenefits could collect the monthly commission that traditional brokers are now paid. In return for that fee, Zenefits would give small businesses some very good H.R. software. “So it’s literally the case that in return for this fee that most small businesses didn’t know they were paying to brokers anyway, they get thousands of dollars of software for free,” said Dr. Kocher, who became one of Zenefits’ earliest investors. This unusual model is threatening to traditional health brokerage firms. In slightly more than a year of operation in California, Zenefits became the No. 1 broker submitting new plans to Anthem Blue Cross, one of the state’s largest providers, in the “small group” market, which serves businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Zenefits has since expanded and is now licensed as a broker in 50 states and has customers in 41, according to the company. Customers describe the Zenefits sales pitch as irresistible. Justin Winter, co-founder of Diamond Candles, an online store based in Durham, N.C., signed up earlier this year after comparing Zenefits with a local broker. “The traditional brokers came here and we had a face-to-face meeting, and they were knowledgeable and very nice,” Mr. Winter said. “But we’re getting so many extra bonuses with Zenefits for the exact same price, we had to choose them.” Like several other customers, he described the Zenefits software as a major inducement. “We don’t have an H.R. person,” he said. “Instead of having to have a full-time person dealing with benefits, we can have this nice, free solution that automates that work.” Zenefits has hit the brokerage industry with such ferocity that, in four states, brokers have complained to insurance regulators that its free-software pitch constitutes unfair competition. Zenefits denies the accusation, and regulators in Texas and Washington have closed their investigations; in Utah and Wisconsin, they are pending. Brokers have also responded to Zenefits by trying to modernize their own operations. BenefitsConnect, a software company that is also a licensed brokerage firm, has had success selling its technology to other brokers. Troy R. Underwood, its chief executive, said he doubted whether the Zenefits model would have lasting appeal. Good brokers, he argues, do more than simply help a business shop for health insurance; they are also a source of quick, constant help in tackling the inevitable complexities of health coverage that arise over the years. Though Zenefits does offer its customers a personal representative, it also tries to automate many queries through software (the same way that Amazon, say, offers an online form for handling returns). Traditional brokers argue that a less personal touch might hinder Zenefits’ service in the long run. “Since they’re based in San Francisco, they’re going to have a hard time playing golf with a client in Atlanta or Houston,” Mr. Underwood said. “Eight times out of 10, employers want to be able to look someone in the eye.” Jonathan Gruber, a health care economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a different critique — involving a lack of transparency in broker fees themselves. In the long run, he’d prefer that the health insurance brokerage market evolve into something like tax-preparation market: It’s now possible to file your taxes electronically without help, though you may want to pay a tax preparer to spare you the headaches. “Once all these health exchanges are working well, we shouldn’t need health brokers anymore for shopping,” Mr. Gruber said. “My hope would be that we’d move to a world where you’d pay explicitly for this service to help you make this hard decision.” Before Zenefits revolutionizes anything, it has to figure out its own trajectory. “The biggest challenge that we have is scaling,” Mr. Conrad said. “Even when we think things are going well, it always feels like the wheels are ready to come off the cart.” Some of the company’s problems are the routine worries that every start-up faces, only an order of magnitude larger. Growth problems pop up suddenly and require creative fixes. Early this summer, it became obvious that the way Zenefits was entering new customers into its database was too time-consuming. “It was a 5-pound-bag, 10-pounds-of-poop problem,” Mr. Conrad said. “Every day, we were able to load six to eight companies, but we were signing up 16 to 18.” Eventually, there was a backlog of more than a month and a half. “It was a company-ending thing.” To fix the problem, Mr. Conrad assigned five engineers who worked day and night to rethink the company-loading work flow. They resolved the issue — only to find that as customers came pouring through the new Zenefits loading system, the employees whose job it was to manage all the customers became bogged down. “Every day, there’s a roving bottleneck that you have to fix,” Mr. Conrad said. This is the cloud now hanging over Zenefits. As the company grows, can it serve tens of thousands or more customers mainly through software, without adding lots of staff — the way, for instance, Google has managed to do? Or, like Groupon and other start-ups that grew too quickly, will it need to hire lots of expensive sales and customer service representatives, straining its bottom line? Moreover, the market is in flux. “It’s a pretty uncertain time for insurance sales right now,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The Affordable Care Act is changing everything about how small businesses and individuals buy insurance, so I’d say the future of this model isn’t certain.” The law requires businesses with more than 50 workers to provide insurance to their workers, a provision that could expand the Zenefits target market. On the other hand, the law’s subsidies for individuals could reduce the number of workers receiving employer-sponsored coverage. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that by 2024, seven million fewer workers will receive coverage through their jobs. “This is not a growing gravy train,” Mr. Levitt said. The Affordable Care Act also called for the creation of state-run insurance exchanges aimed at small businesses; those have been delayed, but eventually they, too, may streamline the way small businesses buy health care. But because the exchanges will allow firms to use brokers, the Zenefits business would still work under that model. In the long run, such efficiencies could help keep down the costs of health care. “When you can see all the plans online, people tend to choose narrower-cost ones — and that has the effect of pushing doctors and hospitals to try to get into those lower-cost plans,” Dr. Kocher said. But as traditional brokers get up to speed on the basics, Zenefits has begun adding more advanced features to its H.R. suite, which it either gives away or also sells on commission. The software now lets businesses manage their stock options and commuter benefits and track workers’ hours. Part of Mr. Conrad’s secret is that he runs Zenefits on Zenefits — so as the company grows and problems arise, he can identify new H.R. headaches to address. In other words, the bigger Zenefits becomes, the better his chances of solving all our workplace problems.

Summarize the following: If you want to burn a movie file so that it plays on any DVD player, you'll need special \\"DVD authoring\\" software. There are lots of these programs available, but DVD Styler is free and open-source. You can download it from dvdstyler.org/en/downloads.  Chrome may report the DVDStyler installation file as malware. If you get this warning, use a different browser to download the installer. Pay attention when installing the program. As of 6/6/2015, the Windows 64-bit installer did not bundle any adware, but this may change in the future. Read every installation screen carefully. When you launch DVD Styler for the first time, you'll be taken to the New Project window. There are a few settings you can adjust here before adding your video file(s):  Disc label - This is the name that will appear when the disc is inserted in a computer. Disc capacity - Most DVDs are DVD-5 (4.7 GB). If you have Dual Layer (DL) discs, select DVD-9 (8.5 GB). Video/Audio bitrate - This affects the quality of the video and audio. Most users can leave these at their defaults. Video Format - Choose PAL if you live in a PAL region (Europe, Asia, Brazil) or NTSC for NTSC regions (Americas, Japan, Korea). You will be prompted to change this if you add media that is in a different format. Aspect Ratio - Choose 4:3 if you're going to play the DVD on a standard definition television. Choose 16:9 if you're going to play the DVD on an HDTV. Note that this will not affect the aspect ratio of the actual video file. Audio Format - You can choose between AC3 or MP2. Most users can leave this on AC3. DVD Styler comes with several menu templates that you can choose from. You can also select \\"No template\\", which will just start playing the video as soon as the disc is inserted. This will add the video to your project. DVD Styler supports most video formats so you won't need to convert before adding.  The bar at the bottom of the window will display how many minutes of video you have used and how many you still have free. Depending on the type of video you're adding, you may be able to add multiple files. For example, you can usually fit 4-6 episodes of a TV show onto a single DVD, or a single full-length movie and some extras. Once you've added your video files, you can edit your menus to your liking. Double-click on any of the elements to edit them, and you can click and drag objects to move them around the menu. Double-clicking on button objects in the menu editor will allow you to change their navigation commands. Once you've set all of your options, you can start burning the DVD. Insert a blank disc and click the \\"Burn\\" button at the top of the window. This will give you several different options. Click Start when you're ready:  \\"Temp directory\\" - You can set the folder that you want DVD Styler to store the temporary files during the burning process. These will be deleted once the burn is complete. You will need enough free space for about twice the size of the disc. \\"preview\\" - Check this box if you want to preview the disc in your media player program before burning it. \\"just generate\\" - This saves the project to your hard disk in the DVD Folder format, which can then be burned later. \\"create iso image\\" - This saves an image of the disc to your hard drive in ISO format.

A: The answer is:","output":"Coral animals or polyps.  Step 1: Identify the distinctive features mentioned in the question In this case, the two main features are animals that live with zooxanthellae and the fact that these zooxanthellae can photosynthesize. Step 2: Recall information based on distinctive features Once I've identified the features, I need to think of any animals that have a mutual relationship with photosynthesizing organisms like zooxanthellae. Coral animals, also known as polyps, are one of the primary animals that share this type of relationship. Step 3: Confirm the information Zooxanthellae are single-celled algae that live within the tissues of coral animals. They provide energy to the coral through photosynthesis in exchange for a protected environment and access to nutrients. This mutual relationship is known as symbiosis. Step 4: Formulate the answer Now that I've confirmed the information, I can provide the answer: Coral animals or polyps are examples of animals that live with tiny zooxanthellae that also photosynthesize."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \\"I choose to be cheerful.\\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \\"This is my lucky day.\\" I replied, smiling. \\"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\\" She was puzzled. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\\" I replied, \\"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class.

Options: - movies - photograph - laboratory - basket - museum  The answer is \\"movies\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"movies\\" because movie theaters are places where people gather to watch films on large screens, while being immersed in a collective viewing experience. The environment in a movie theater is designed to create a comfortable and engaging atmosphere for all attendees, including ensuring that the audio-visual quality is of the highest standard. To achieve this, theaters often have strict regulations concerning items or objects that can pose a disturbance or interfere with the overall movie-watching experience. Small dogs, as much as they might be beloved by their owners, have a tendency to be unpredictable, easily frightened, or overly excited in new and unfamiliar environments. If a small dog were to be allowed into a movie theater, there is a risk that it might become a nuisance by barking, growling, or whining during the film, thereby disrupting the movie for other attendees. Additionally, dogs might need to relieve themselves during the course of the film, which could lead to an unpleasant mess that could be damaging to the theater's equipment, upholstery, and cleanliness. Moreover, people with allergies to pet dander might suffer from allergic reactions in a closed, confined space such as a movie theater. A person who experiences allergies also has the right to enjoy the film without any discomfort or health risks. However, it is essential to mention that service dogs and emotional support animals are typically exempt from this rule, as they undergo extensive training and are legally protected to assist people with disabilities. These animals are trained to remain calm and quiet during the movie, ensuring that they do not create any disturbance. Comparing the other options: - Photograph: This option doesn't make much sense as small dogs are usually allowed in photographs – they are often even the main subject of the pictures. - Laboratory: While this may be a place where small dogs, or pets in general, are not allowed, the question specifically asked for a place with pictures, which doesn't apply to laboratories. - Basket: Baskets are not generally considered places, but containers or items of storage. Small dogs might even find a basket quite comfortable to rest in. However, they are not related to pictures. - Museum: Although many museums have strict policies regarding pet entry, some specifically allow service animals and may even host special days when pets are allowed. As a result, this cannot be the definitive answer. Therefore, the answer \\"movies\\" is the most accurate choice, as movie theaters are public places designed for enjoying various types of visual media and generally have strict regulations against allowing small dogs or other pets for practical and health-related reasons."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Movie plot: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of Jason murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason kills Michael in real life, along with Jane, and later kills another couple camping in the woods. While Tina goes off to find her mother and Nick goes with her, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens. Russell is killed with a hatchet to the face, and Sandra is pulled underwater while she is skinny-dipping. Jason stalks Maddie and kills her in the barn with a scythe, and then crushes Ben's skull with his bare hands before shoving a party horn...

For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

The task is to complete the sentence in a coherent and meaningful manner. The sentence sets up a contrast between the sales of canvas and frames in the art store. The implication is that while many canvases were sold, fewer frames were due to some reason. Option i: \\"canvas were so expensive\\", does not make sense in the given context because if the canvases were expensive, it should have discouraged sales. However, the sentence specifies that a lot of canvases were sold, implying they were not prohibitively expensive, or their price did not limit their sales. Option ii: \\"frames were so expensive.\\" aligns logically with the contrast presented in the original sentence. This suggests that despite their availability, less frames were sold due to them being expensive. The high price of the frames would effectively reduce their sales, which is what the sentence originally implies. Thus, this option is chosen to complete the sentence.

I read this background article the other day: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  I am facing a new situation today: The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city had a lower incidence of respiratory problems? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation you have described, we can determine that City Y, with its proper waste disposal site for the hospital's biomedical wastes, would likely have a lower incidence of respiratory problems compared to City X. The article highlights the adverse impacts of poor waste management, such as increased incidence and prevalence of diseases like malaria and respiratory problems. Additionally, the contamination of ground water by biomedical waste can lead to further negative health consequences. In City X, the hospital's improper disposal of biomedical wastes has resulted in ground water contamination, thus negatively affecting the population. On the other hand, the hospital in City Y has a good disposal site for biomedical wastes, which indicates better waste management practices. The improved waste management in City Y is likely to result in a decreased risk of ground water contamination and a lower prevalence of illnesses, including respiratory problems, among the residents. In conclusion, City Y, with its better waste management practices and proper disposal site for biomedical wastes, would likely have a lower incidence of respiratory problems compared to City X, where the contamination of ground water due to poor waste disposal has caused health problems among the population."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who hires someone to kill the corrupt Mexican army officer? is inside the article: El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government.

How do you do this: To prevent unwanted pregnancies when having sex,","output":"To prevent unwanted pregnancies when having sex, follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the importance of contraception Before engaging in sexual activities, it's crucial to comprehend the significance of contraception and how it helps prevent unwanted pregnancies. Educate yourself about the various methods available, their effectiveness, and any potential side effects to make informed decisions. Step 2: Have open communication with your partner Discuss contraception options with your partner to determine the most suitable method for both of you. It's essential for both parties to be on the same page about preventing pregnancy and to respect each other's choice. Step 3: Choose a suitable contraceptive method Select a contraceptive method based on factors such as effectiveness, accessibility, affordability, and possible side effects. Here are a few commonly used options: - Barrier methods: These include condoms (both male and female), diaphragms, and cervical caps. They work by physically blocking sperm from entering the uterus. Barrier methods are readily available and can also protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Hormonal methods: These include birth control pills, patches, injections, and vaginal rings. They work by releasing hormones to prevent ovulation or change the uterine environment making it harder for sperm to reach the egg. You'll need a prescription from a healthcare professional for hormonal contraceptives, but they're highly effective when used correctly. - Intrauterine devices (IUDs): An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare professional to prevent pregnancy. There are two types: hormonal and copper-based. Both types have high effectiveness rates and can be used as a long-term contraceptive method. - Emergency contraception: Also known as the \\"morning-after pill,\\" emergency contraception can be used within 72 hours (preferably sooner) after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Keep in mind that this should not be used as a regular contraceptive method but only in emergencies. Step 4: Consistently and correctly use your chosen contraceptive method Adhere to the necessary instructions when using contraceptives. For instance, if you're on birth control pills, take them every day at the same time without skipping doses. If using condoms, make sure they are used correctly, are not expired, and are stored in a suitable environment to prevent damage. Step 5: Regularly visit a healthcare professional Schedule appointments with doctors or healthcare professionals to discuss your contraceptive options, assess the chosen method's effectiveness, and address any side effects you might experience. Regular check-ups ensure that your contraceptive needs are continuously evaluated and adjusted as needed. In summary, preventing unwanted pregnancies requires responsible decision-making, open communication with your partner, choosing the appropriate contraceptive method, and consistently using it correctly. Keeping up with healthcare appointments and staying informed about your options will further ensure that you are taking the necessary precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies."},{"instruction":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a \\"love/hate relationship\\" with the city?  \\"City of Angels\\" was written by lead vocalist Jared Leto, who also produced the song with Steve Lillywhite.

A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up.  There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time.

Does the sentence \\"The two main denominations of Islam are the Sunni and Shia sects.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What are the two main things differentiating Sunni and Shia?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"The two main denominations of Islam are the Sunni and Shia sects.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What are the two main things differentiating Sunni and Shia?\\" The given sentence simply identifies the two main branches of Islam, but it does not offer any specific points of differentiation between them.  To answer the question effectively, it is crucial to provide information about their key distinctions in terms of beliefs, practices, and historical context. Here is a more detailed and long answer to the question: Sunni and Shia Islam are the two predominant branches of the Islamic faith. While both groups share the fundamental tenets of Islam, at their core, they have theological, political, and historical differences that have shaped their distinct identities over time. There are two main factors differentiating Sunni and Shia Muslims: 1. Political and Historical Differences: The origin of the Sunni and Shia split can be traced back to the early days of Islam and revolves around the question of the rightful leadership or Caliphate after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE.  Sunni Muslims believed that the Prophet's father-in-law, Abu Bakr, was the most suitable candidate to lead the Muslim community, or the Ummah. They contended that the Prophet had not specifically designated a successor and that Abu Bakr's quick election by the community as the first Caliph was legitimate. Sunnis deem the first four Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) as the \\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\\" and follow their example in religious and political matters. On the other hand, Shia Muslims argued that the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, was divinely chosen as his successor. They maintain that the Prophet's true successor ought to have been selected from his family, the Ahl al-Bayt, and consequently view Ali as the first Imam, or spiritual leader. For Shia Muslims, the Imams are considered infallible and divinely-guided leaders who continue to exert spiritual guidance through historical lineage. 2. Theological and Jurisprudential Differences: The theological and jurisprudential differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims are rooted in their distinct understandings of religious authority and leadership. While Sunnis follow the consensus of the Ummah and the traditions of the first four Caliphs, Shia Muslims emphasize the importance of the Imams as divinely-appointed leaders. In terms of jurisprudence or Islamic law, Sunni Muslims adhere to four main schools of thought: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. These schools represent distinct methodologies in interpreting the Islamic scriptures—the Quran and the prophetic traditions (Hadith)—and applying them to legal rulings. Sunni Muslims believe that religious scholars, or Ulama, hold vital roles in interpreting and guiding the community in religious matters. Conversely, Shia Muslims have their own unique school of thought in jurisprudence known as the Jafari or Twelver school, named after the twelve Imams that they recognize. Shia Muslims believe that the Imams have unique access to divine knowledge and that their interpretations and decisions are authoritative. For Shia, the Ayatollahs (senior religious scholars) play a crucial role in providing guidance and interpreting Islamic jurisprudence, due to their spiritual connection to the line of Imams. Despite these differences, it is essential to note that Sunni and Shia Muslims both share the core beliefs in Islam, including the Five Pillars (faith, prayer, alms-giving, fasting, and pilgrimage) and reverence for the Quran as the holy book. However, the key points of divergence encompass political and historical backgrounds, religious leadership, and jurisprudential perspectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brian Wayne Transeau (born October 4, 1971), better known by his stage name BT, is an American music producer, composer, technologist, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. An artist in the electronica music genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the trance and intelligent dance music styles that paved the way for EDM, and for \\"stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.\\" He also creates music within many other styles, such as classical, film composition and bass music. BT is also known for pioneering the stutter edit. In 1999, BT released his third album, Movement in Still Life, and continued his previous experimentation outside of the trance genre. The album features a strong element of nu skool breaks, a genre he helped define with \\"Hip-Hop Phenomenon\\" in collaboration with Tsunami One aka Adam Freeland and Kevin Beber. Along with trance collaborations with Paul van Dyk and DJ Rap, Movement includes pop (\\"Never Gonna Come Back Down\\" with M. Doughty on vocals), progressive house (\\"Dreaming\\" with Kirsty Hawkshaw on vocals) and hip hop-influenced tracks (\\"Madskill - Mic Chekka\\", which samples Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \\"The Message\\", and \\"Smartbomb\\", a mix of funky, heavy riffs from both synthesizers and guitars woven over a hip-hop break). \\"Shame\\" and \\"Satellite\\" lean toward an alt-rock sound, while \\"Godspeed\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" fall into classic trance ranks. \\"Running Down the Way Up\\", a collaboration with fellow electronic act Hybrid, features sultry vocals and acoustic guitars heavily edited into a progressive breakbeat track.  \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Godspeed\\" reached #5 and #10 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, respectively, \\"Never Gonna Come Back Down\\" reached #9 the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and #16 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, and the album reached #166 on the Billboard 200 album charts.  Long interested in branching out into film scoring, BT got the opportunity when director Doug Liman asked him to score Go, a 1999 film about dance music culture. Shortly after creating the score, BT moved to Los Angeles in order to further pursue film scoring. He also began writing music for string quartets to prove his capabilities beyond electronic music. He was then hired to score the film Under Suspicion with a 60-piece string section. For The Fast and the Furious, BT's score featured a 70-piece ensemble, along with polyrhythmic tribal sounds produced by orchestral percussionists banging on car chassis.  In 1999, BT collaborated with Peter Gabriel on the album OVO, the soundtrack to the Millennium Dome Show in London. In 2001, he produced NSYNC's hit single \\"Pop\\", which won a 2001 Teen Choice Award for Choice Single, won four MTV Video Music Awards, and reached #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 on the UK Singles chart.

When we subtract, we get: 1798 = 62 * g. Now, to find g, we want to divide both sides of the equation by 62: 1798 ÷ 62 = g. When we do the division, we find out that g = 29.

When his business partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) demands more sensational exhibits to increase profits, Jarrod refuses. Jarrod then gives a private tour to renowned art critic Sidney Wallace. Wallace, deeply impressed with Jarrod's sculptures, agrees to buy Burke out, but will not be able to do so until after he returns from a continental trip. That same night, Burke deliberately sets the museum on fire, intending to claim the insurance money. In the process, he fights off Jarrod, who is desperately attempting to save his precious sculptures. Burke splashes kerosene over Jarrod's body and leaves him to die in the fire. Miraculously, Jarrod survives, but with severe injuries including crippled hands. He builds a new House of Wax with help from deaf-mute sculptor Igor (Charles Bronson) and another assistant named Leon Averill.

The case he receives is that of a brilliant but troubled 16-year-old girl, Anna Greene, who is on a hunger strike. Her stepfather wants her sent to a mental institution, which Anna's mother and Anna herself are adamantly against. John is sent to end her hunger strike. John and Anna begin their therapy sessions, focusing on Anna's time at a prestigious girl's school and several incidents that happened there. John finds himself drawn to Anna, while, at the same time, remaining wary of her. Anna's maid, Judith, who John had just started dating, is thrown down the stairs, and Anna is blamed for the incident. John also harbors suspicions towards Anna's stepfather, who he believes has hired a mysterious man to shadow him, as well as towards Sebastian, who John learns has withheld a file on Anna from him.

WALKER COUNTY, Ga. – A Georgia woman is speaking out to help others avoid the gruesome injuries she suffered after the car she was in crashed – while her feet were on the dashboard.      Audra Tatum of Walker County, Georgia, said her husband always warned her about sitting with her feet like that. But, she didn’t listen to him until they got into a car accident a couple of years ago.      Tatum broke several bones including her ankle, femur and arm. “The airbag went off, throwing my foot up and breaking my nose. I was looking at the bottom of my foot facing up at me,” she told CBS News. It took her over a month to start walking again, and she is still recovering two years later. She’s hoping others learn from her mistake.      Tatum isn’t the only one warning about this. The Chattanooga Fire Department posted a warning on Facebook, titled “Something You Need to Know”: ||||| As soon as Audra Tatum would hop into the passenger seat of a car, the mother of three from Walker County, Georgia, would lean back and relax with her feet up on the dashboard.      Her husband warned her about the dangerous habit, but Tatum didn't care — it was comfortable.      \\"All my life I had my legs crossed and my foot on the dash,\\" Tatum told CBS News. \\"My husband always told me, 'You're going to get in a wreck someday, and you're going to break your legs.'\\"      Tatum assured him he was wrong.      \\"I'll put my foot down in time,\\" she would always reply.      But two years ago, on August 2, 2015, Tatum's perspective changed completely.      The couple was heading to her parents' house about 4 miles away to pick up her two sons when a car pulled in front of her husband and they T-boned him. Everyone was able to walk away from the scene with scrapes and bruises, except for Tatum.      \\"The airbag went off, throwing my foot up and breaking my nose,\\" Tatum explained. \\"I was looking at the bottom of my foot facing up at me.\\"      Courtesy Audra Tatum      Tatum's ankle, femur and arm were all broken by the impact.      \\"Basically my whole right side was broken, and it's simply because of my ignorance,\\" Tatum said. \\"I'm not Superman. I couldn't put my foot down in time.\\"      Tatum underwent several surgeries and weeks of physical therapy. It took her over a month to start walking again.      Courtesy Audra Tatum      Two years later, she's still facing obstacles.      \\"I can't do my career as an EMS. I can't lift patients anymore,\\" she explained. \\"I can't stand more than 4 hours at a time. Once I'm at that 4-hour mark I'm in tears.\\"      Now the mom is using her story to warn others.      \\"I keep telling everybody, you don't want this life,\\" she said. \\"You don't want the pain and agony every day.\\"      A local fire department is helping to spread her story to demonstrate the serious consequences of resting your foot on a dashboard.      \\"Airbags deploy between 100 and 220 MPH. If you ride with your feet on the dash and you're involved in an accident, the airbag may send your knees through your eye sockets,\\" the Chattanooga Fire Department warned in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 1,600 times.      If there wasn't an airbag at all, Tatum predicts her injuries could have been even worse.      \\"It could have done so much more damage. It did make it break my nose, but I could've hit the dash a whole lot harder without that airbag,\\" she said.

Posted by Chattanooga Fire Department on Monday, August 7, 2017      As she continues to recover, Tatum plans on telling her story to even more members of her community — and she hopes people get the message.      \\"If I can save one person from doing this and they're not going through it, that would be wonderful,\\" Tatum said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A woman in Georgia had an accident while she was sitting in a car with her feet on the dashboard.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available options: *Attach an air filter on both ends of the air line. *Attach a coffee filter on both ends of the air line.","output":"To accomplish the goal of keeping water from coming out the end of an airbrush and ruining the paint, it makes more sense to attach an air filter on both ends of the air line. Let us discuss the reasons behind this: Air filter mechanism: 1. Moisture Trapping: Air filters, specifically those designed for airbrushes, often contain moisture traps. These traps are designed to capture water, condensed air, and other contaminants that can mix with the paint and potentially damage the quality of the airbrushed artwork. By attaching air filters to both ends of the air line, you would effectively keep any unwanted moisture from entering the airbrush, ensuring that the paint remains unaffected. 2. Air Purification: Quality air filters can help further purify the air by trapping dust, oil, and other impurities before they reach the airbrush. This ensures that the paint is being applied through clean, dry air, resulting in a smoother and higher quality finish. 3. Consistent air pressure: Air filters made for airbrushing maintain consistent airflow and pressure, reducing fluctuations that could lead to uneven or poor paint coverage. Connecting filters to both ends of the air line would guarantee that the airbrush receives a steady stream of air, providing a more precise application of paint. Coffee filter mechanism: 1. Inefficiency: Coffee filters are made primarily for filtering coffee grounds from brewed coffee and are not as effective at capturing moisture and impurities in the air. While they might absorb some water, they will not offer the same level of protection as air filters, making them an inefficient option. 2. Restriction: Attaching coffee filters to the air line would restrict the airflow, possibly leading to uneven paint application and reduced air pressure. This can hamper the airbrush's performance, making it difficult to achieve a consistent and high-quality finish. 3. Clogging: Over time, coffee filters may clog due to collected moisture and impurities. This can further restrict airflow and even cause damage to the airbrush if left unchecked. In summary, attaching an air filter on both ends of the air line is the more sensible option given its moisture trapping capabilities, air purification, and consistent air pressure maintenance. Using coffee filters is not recommended as it lacks efficiency, negatively affects airflow and pressure, and may cause clogging, all of which could negatively impact the quality of the airbrushed artwork."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select your answer from the options. Do these sentences mean the same thing? pick from the following. [I] no. [II] yes.","output":"[I] No. These sentences do not mean the same thing. Upon close inspection of the phrases, one can differentiate the meanings of these sentences. Let's break down each sentence to understand the difference. 1. \\"Die\\" or \\"Remember that you will remember\\" - In this sentence, there is a comparison between two distinct actions or thoughts. \\"Die\\" usually refers to the end of life or the process of ceasing to exist. Contrasting that, \\"Remember that you will remember\\" implies a sense of mindfulness or being aware that something will remain in one's memory. It may encourage someone to live in a manner that leaves a positive memory or impact on their life and the lives of others. 2. \\"Die death\\" or \\"Remember that you will remember\\" - The first part of this sentence, \\"Die death,\\" seems to be a redundancy as \\"die\\" and \\"death\\" essentially mean the same thing. It reiterates the concept of the end of life or, at least, the finality or certainty of death as an inevitable occurrence. The second part of the sentence remains the same as in the first sentence with its theme of retaining memories. From these explanations, it is evident that the two sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence juxtaposes the concepts of death and living a life that will leave a lasting memory, while the second sentence stresses the aspect of death even more but still retains the idea of committing actions or events worth remembering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"A war with major oil-producing nations would have both direct and indirect impacts on the greenhouse gas emission process. Here's an explanation of each type of perturbation: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: A war could lead to disruptions in oil production and distribution, resulting in decreased availability and increased prices for oil products. This might cause a reduction in overall fuel consumption due to higher costs, leading to reduced burning of fossil fuels and therefore less carbon dioxide production from engines. Additionally, economic strains on oil-producing nations could slow down their development, potentially leading to slower growth in energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: A war in oil-producing regions could lead to a shift towards prioritizing renewable and alternative energy sources due to increased oil prices and decreased availability. This would encourage technological advancements in green energy and increased investments in clean energy infrastructure, fostering a more sustainable approach to energy production and consumption. As a result, there could be less reliance on fossil fuels, leading to reduced carbon dioxide production from engines and other processes. Furthermore, political instability and the need for self-reliance could push non-oil producing nations to develop more sustainable energy policies, driving down overall greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to note that war would likely have negative consequences beyond the scope of greenhouse gas emissions, such as humanitarian crises, environmental damage, and long-lasting political repercussions. While decreased oil production as a result of a war might initially contribute to less greenhouse gas emissions, working towards sustainable energy solutions and international cooperation would be far more advantageous for addressing climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence 2: Colgate's brand of Baking Soda and Peroxide has an unpleasant green shade.  If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Indeed, if we consider the first sentence to be true, we can deduce that the second sentence is also likely to be true. To further analyze the relationship between the two sentences, let's break them down and gain a clearer understanding of their respective components. Sentence 1: \\"Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide is a sickly, opaque green.\\" In this statement, the author describes the Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide as having a \\"sickly, opaque green\\" color. The two adjectives, \\"sickly\\" and \\"opaque,\\" provide specific details about the shade of green being described. \\"Sickly\\" generally indicates an unattractive or unhealthy appearance, while \\"opaque\\" suggests that the green color is not transparent or see-through. Therefore, this sentence portrays the Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide as having an unappealing shade of green that cannot be seen through. Sentence 2: \\"Colgate's brand of Baking Soda and Peroxide has an unpleasant green shade.\\" Here, the author reiterates the notion that Colgate's Baking Soda and Peroxide has a green color but replaces the previous adjectives (\\"sickly\\" and \\"opaque\\") with the term \\"unpleasant\\" to describe this shade of green. \\"Unpleasant\\" implies that the green hue is disagreeable or not enjoyable, which essentially conveys a similar sentiment as the adjective \\"sickly\\" in Sentence 1. Given that both sentences describe the color of Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide in a negative light – with Sentence 1 using the terms \\"sickly\\" and \\"opaque,\\" and Sentence 2 employing the word \\"unpleasant\\" – it is reasonable to assume that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 can also be considered true. Both statements essentially convey that the Colgate Baking Soda and Peroxide has a green color that many people may find undesirable or unappealing. While the adjectives used in the respective sentences vary, they all contribute to a similar overall impression of the product's color."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\".

Clayton begins reading from his book which focuses on a fictional character named Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), an aspiring writer who lives in New York City with his girlfriend, Dora (Zoe Saldana). Rory borrows some money from his father (J. K. Simmons), gets a job as a mail supervisor at a literary agency and attempts to sell his first novel, which is repeatedly rejected by publishers. After living together for some time, Rory and Dora marry and, during their honeymoon in Paris, Dora buys Rory an old briefcase from an antiques store he was admiring. After returning to America and having his book rejected again, Rory finds an old but masterfully written manuscript in the briefcase with a central character named Jack. Rory types the manuscript into his laptop. Later, while using the laptop, Dora happens upon the novel and reads it. She mistakenly assumes that Rory wrote the novel and convinces him to give it to a publisher at work, Joseph Cutler (Å½eljko Ivanek) as his own. After a few months Joseph finally reads the manuscript and offers Rory a contract which he accepts. The book is a hit and Rory becomes famous. At this point, Hammond takes a break from the reading and goes backstage, where he is introduced by his agent (John Hannah) to Daniella (Olivia Wilde), a student and amateur writer who wants to interview him and notes that he is separated from his wife, although he still wears a wedding ring.

Article: Washing the grease from your hair may seem like the best solution at first, but daily washing actually causes your hair to produce more grease. Your hair tries to make up for the natural oils you’re washing out each day, causing a cycle of increased grease. Wash your hair only 2 to 3 times per week maximum for the best results. Getting your hair wet without washing also causes natural oils to be stripped away and causes your hair to overcompensate in grease. To protect your hair from getting wet in the shower, secure it inside a shower cap. Hair that’s prone to grease doesn’t need more conditioning near the roots, it needs less. However, not conditioning your hair at all can cause your ends to get dry and damaged-looking. When you use conditioner after shampooing, apply it starting halfway down your hair and go all the way to your ends.  Be sure to always rinse conditioner thoroughly from your hair, or use a leave-in conditioner. On days that you’re not shampooing, you can get rid of style creases or cowlicks by rinsing the creased parts of your hair and applying conditioner there as well. Hot water opens the cuticle of your hair and strips more natural oils from your hair. Hot water also causes your pores, including the ones on your scalp, to produce more sebum, or thick oil. This thick oil will start traveling down your hair strands from your scalp as soon as you leave your hot shower. For the best results, keep your shower water as cool as you can, especially when rinsing shampoo and conditioner from your hair. Cool water closes the cuticle of your hair, which will help to keep moisture in. Using too much shampoo with each wash can lead to build-up and make your hair look heavy and greasy. When squirting shampoo into your hand to use, make sure you use no more than a large coin amount, like a quarter or two-pence piece. You may need more or less depending on the length and thickness of your hair. If you accidently squirt too much shampoo into your hand, remove some of it before starting to apply shampoo to your hair. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter version of a longer text that includes the main points and important details, but is easier and quicker to read.

Fact 2: Heat is a measurement of transferable energy.  Given the two facts above, a thermal insulator slows the transfer of? Answer:","output":"A thermal insulator, given Fact 1 and Fact 2, slows the transfer of heat, which is essentially the transfer of thermal energy between objects or systems.  To understand the relationship between these two facts, it is important to have a solid grasp of the concepts of heat and thermal insulators.  Fact 1: A thermal insulator slows the transfer of heat Thermal insulation refers to the process or materials that prevent or slow down the transfer of heat from one area to another. This can be achieved through several mechanisms: 1. Conduction is the transfer of heat between objects in direct contact with each other. Insulators interrupt this process by minimizing contact between hot and cold objects or using materials with low thermal conductivity. 2. Convection is the heat transfer via fluids (gas or liquid) that move and carry thermal energy between different locations. Insulators obstruct the fluid's motion, reducing convection and the resulting heat exchange. 3. Radiation is the process of heat exchange through electromagnetic waves, primarily in the infrared spectrum. Insulating materials can absorb and reflect radiant heat to minimize its transfer between surfaces.  Fact 2: Heat is a measurement of transferable energy Heat can be defined as a form of energy that is transferred between systems or objects when they are at different temperatures. The transfer occurs from the higher temperature object to the lower temperature object until thermal equilibrium is achieved. Heat energy is primarily a result of the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in a substance. It is important to note that heat itself is not stored in objects; rather, objects have internal energy (also known as thermal energy), which leads to a measurable temperature. Based on the understanding of these two facts, a thermal insulator slows the transfer of heat, which stems from the movement of thermal energy. This implies that a thermal insulator slows down the transfer of thermal energy between objects or systems, allowing them to maintain their respective temperatures and prevent heat loss or gain. The effectiveness of a thermal insulator depends on the materials used, their arrangement, and the specific mechanisms they target (conduction, convection, or radiation). In conclusion, given Fact 1 and Fact 2, a thermal insulator slows down the transfer of thermal energy, or heat, between objects or systems, which results in conservation of temperature and prevention of heat loss or gain. This ability to slow heat transfer is essential in various industries and applications, including building construction, transportation, and the design of clothing and appliances, to achieve increased energy efficiency, comfort, and cost savings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Research on whole grain oats and its elements. 2. Research on Farro and its relationship to whole grain oats. 3. Determine whether Farro is a reasonable answer based on the gathered information. Step 1: Whole grain oats are a type of grain that is commonly consumed as a breakfast cereal or in various recipes.

Step 2: Farro is an ancient grain, different from oats, that belongs to the wheat family. It is also a whole grain and is known for its nutty flavor, chewy texture, and nutritional value. Farro shares some nutritional components with oats, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. Step 3: Although Farro is a whole grain and shares some similar nutritional components with oats, it is not a component of whole grain oats. The question is asking specifically about elements within whole grain oats, which would not include a separate grain like Farro.

Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme criticism of Mr Corbyn was unfair. \\"On the one hand people criticise Jeremy for being weak and taking too long on his reshuffles and yet when he decides that he needs to do one in order to fill vacancies and reach out, people then criticise him for being too decisive and too strong. You can't play it both ways,\\" she said. \\"We stop fighting among ourselves\\". \\"We have a job to do. We were elected to be MPs, represent our constituents and stand up to the government. That's what our priority ought to be and we need to get on with it.\\" In this week's reshuffle several MPs who quit the shadow cabinet in the summer in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership returned to the fold. In other appointments, deputy leader Tom Watson was appointed shadow culture secretary and Jon Ashworth became shadow health secretary. John Healey returned to housing and Diane Abbott became shadow home secretary. Labour's new shadow cabinet in full In his letter to Labour MPs, Mr Cryer said the PLP in early September voted \\"overwhelmingly\\" for the return of elections to the shadow cabinet. \\"This led to negotiations involving myself and the then chief whip, Rosie Winterton, and people from the leadership team,\\" he wrote. \\"As far as Rosie and I were concerned, the talks were held in good faith with the aim of striking an agreement which would allow some places to be filled through elections while the leader would retain the right to appoint others.\\" Mr Cryer said it then became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was under way, which \\"had not been discussed or mentioned\\" during the talks. \\"It now seems to me that the party's leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way,\\" he added. \\"Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events.\\" Ms Winterton was sacked as part of the reshuffle. But a spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who was re-elected as labour leader in September, said shadow cabinet elections were still to be considered by the party's national executive committee. Labour's former home secretary, Alan Johnson - a former critic of Mr Corbyn - said he was still not up to the job of being leader of the opposition. He told the Today programme \\"me and many of my colleagues\\" believed Mr Corbyn was not up to the job, adding: \\"Perhaps he'll prove me wrong.\\" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said while some of Mr Corbyn's critics had been welcomed back to the front bench, very few of his allies had departed. The Labour leader's hold on his party's levers of power was firmer than ever, our correspondent added. Summary:","output":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's recent reshuffle has drawn criticism from opponents who claim it has disrupted talks regarding the election of shadow front bench positions by MPs. Despite objections, Corbyn is supported by some party members who believe his actions are decisive. Several MPs who left the shadow cabinet in the past have now returned. Discussions involving shadow cabinet elections are still ongoing and may be considered by the party's national executive committee."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Background: Timur was born in Transoxiana near the city of Kesh (modern Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan) some 80 kilometres (50 mi) south of Samarkand, part of what was then the Chagatai Khanate. His father, Taraqai, was a minor noble of the Barlas, a Mongolian tribe that had been turkified in many aspects. According to Gerard Chaliand, Timur was a Muslim, and he saw himself as Genghis Khan's heir. Though not a Borjigid or a descendent of Genghis Khan, he clearly sought to invoke the legacy of Genghis Khan's conquests during his lifetime. Context: Timur spent the next 35 years in various wars and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and the Volga. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in Persia, including Baghdad, Karbala and Northern Iraq.  One of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named Tokhtamysh. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern Kipchak and the Golden Horde. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of Khwarizm and Azerbaijan. However, Timur still supported him against the Russians and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and burned Moscow.  In 1395 Tamerlane reached the frontier of Principality of Ryazan, took Elets and advancing towards Moscow came near the banks of the Don River. Great Prince Vasily I of Moscow went with an army to Kolomna and halted at the banks of the Oka River. The clergy brought the famed Theotokos of Vladimir icon from Vladimir to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \\"O Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\\" Suddenly, Tamerlane's armies retreated. In memory of this miraculous deliverance of the Russian Land from Tamerlane on August 26, the all-Russian celebration in honor of the Meeting of the Vladimir Icon of the Most Holy Mother of God was established. Question: What happened at the beginning of Timur's expansion period? Answer:","output":"At the beginning of Timur's expansion period, he focused on consolidating his rule at home and extending his territory through various military campaigns and expeditions. During this time, he sought to subjugate his domestic foes and gradually expand his empire in multiple directions. To the west and northwest, Timur's conquests led him to the lands near the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and Volga rivers. This expansion brought him into contact with various potentates and tribes that he sought to dominate or incorporate into his empire. In the south and southwest, he undertook significant campaigns in Persia, capturing almost every province, including Baghdad, Karbala, and Northern Iraq. These conquests further solidified his empire's foundation and allowed him to project power across a wide geographical area. One of Timur's most formidable opponents was the Mongol ruler Tokhtamysh, a descendant of Genghis Khan. Despite initially hosting Tokhtamysh as a refugee, Timur later found himself in conflict with him over the possession of Khwarizm and Azerbaijan. Although they had their differences, Timur still supported Tokhtamysh against the Russians, leading to the latter's invasion of the Muscovite dominion and the burning of Moscow in 1382. As Timur moved further westward, he eventually reached the frontier of the Principality of Ryazan in 1395. He captured the city of Elets, and his forces continued their advance towards Moscow, nearing the banks of the Don River. However, their progress was halted after the Russian clergy brought the revered Theotokos of Vladimir icon from Vladimir to Moscow, and the people prayed fervently for the protection of their land. In response to these prayers, Timur's forces retreated, marking a turning point in his western expansion. In summary, the beginning of Timur's expansion period was characterized by a series of military campaigns and expeditions aimed at consolidating his rule at home and extending his territory. He successfully conquered lands to the west, northwest, south, and southwest, while encountering formidable opponents such as Tokhtamysh and the Russians. His expansion, however, eventually met resistance, leading to a halt in his western conquests."},{"instruction":"Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who works various odd jobs? is inside the article: Euliss F. \\"Sonny\\" Dewey is a charismatic Pentecostal preacher.

I adore my grandma so I’ll do anything to make her happy. When my grandmas at the bingo she’s a completely different woman, I’ve never seen her so happy, she walks (with her walking trolly for support) faster than I’ve ever seen, she smiles, gets all excited and it just makes my entire day. Today I took her as I always take her the first day after my payday so that I can play along side her (even though I have absolutely no clue what the hell I’m doing), everything was going as normal, I was losing money in confusion, my grandma was somehow winning constantly as always and we were having fun, about half way through the day another lady sat behind us, I see this lady quite a lot and she’s there every time I’m there, her friend came with her and they sat right behind us and spent the whole time chatting super loudly.  Now I’m not sure if any of you have ever gone to bingo but being able to hear the speaker is vital in order to play, and the usual expectation is that everyone should keep quiet or should speak quietly. But because of them chatting about how the bus driver wasn’t white, and what groceries they bought that morning my grandma was struggling to hear the speaker and I could see she was starting to not enjoy our day.  I decided to not say anything as I know this lady was just catching up with a friend, but after 2 hours of constant talking (they weren’t playing at all) I decided to turn around and I politely said “would you be able to keep your voice down my grandma can’t hear the speaker and she’s trying to play” the lady looked at me, didn’t respond and went back to her conversation, I decided to let it slide as I didn’t fancy arguing with someone 3 times my age, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she didn’t understand me, about an hour later my grandma got irritated and went “ Yap Yap Yap that’s what they sound like”, my grandma says things like that sometimes without realising, it’s just how she is now because of her dementia and she can’t help it, evidently the lady heard us because she turned and started having a go at my grandma who didn’t understand what was going on so I said “ if you kept quiet then my grandma wouldn’t mock you, so I suggest you shut up, keep quiet, play what you came here for and leave her alone” to be fair to her the lady did as I said and they kept their voices down.

Dezvoltarea unei politici externe coerente şi eficiente, care să includă şi o viziune asupra ordinii mondiale, trebuie să fie una din principalele provocări ale actualului mandat. Translate this to English?","output":"Developing a coherent and effective foreign policy, which should also include a vision for the global order, must be one of the main challenges of the current term.  A coherent and effective foreign policy is essential for a nation-state to protect its interests and promote its influence in the international arena. In order to tackle contemporary global challenges, it is crucial for any government to adopt a comprehensive foreign policy strategy that comprehensively addresses its political, economic, security, and cultural objectives. A core component of a consistent and successful foreign policy strategy is the development of a clear vision for the world order. This means foreseeing and determining the desired political, economic, social, and legal structures that would govern relations among nations and international organizations. A strong vision for the international order should be based on principles, values, and norms that reflect and advance the aspirations and interests of a nation-state and its people. The global order is constantly changing, driven by factors such as globalization, technological advancements, and shifting power dynamics among great powers. As a result, a proactive approach to foreign policy is needed to anticipate and adapt to these shifts, while positioning a nation-state to take advantage of emerging opportunities and manage potential risks. This requires the development of robust and diverse diplomatic capabilities, strategic partnerships, and seamless coordination among relevant government institutions, think tanks, and NGOs. A coherent and effective foreign policy should also prioritize economic diplomacy, particularly in an increasingly interdependent and competitive international economic landscape. This involves not only negotiating favorable trade agreements and attracting foreign investment but also promoting domestic industries abroad, participating in international financial institutions, and aligning with regional economic integration initiatives. Furthermore, a nation's foreign policy should address its security needs and concerns in a comprehensive manner. This entails deterrence, conflict prevention, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as well as peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and capacity-building measures. It also requires developing a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and challenges emanating from various sources, such as state and non-state actors, cyber threats, and environmental factors. Lastly, a coherent and effective foreign policy should recognize the importance of cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy as indispensable tools to win hearts and minds in the global arena. This means fostering understanding, trust, and cooperation with other societies through engagement in various forms of cultural exchanges, educational initiatives, and collaborative projects. To summarize, developing a coherent and effective foreign policy, which includes a solid vision of the global order, is a critical task for any nation-state's government in the current term. It is essential to address contemporary challenges and seize opportunities in the fast-changing world, while constantly adapting and advancing national interests and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Catching Fire, out in Chinese theaters on Nov 21, is set in a futuristic society called Panem. Every year its government holds a televised fight to the death. Two teenagers from each of the 12 districts of Panem are chosen to compete. In the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life. However, that never seems to happen. She has nightmares, which remind her that she is a killer. Her worst nightmare comes true when the annual Hunger Games arrive again. The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\\" Lawrence told Reuters.

Although a low-quality version leaked on December 31, 2014, a full version of the recording was not made available for the public. A limited quantity edition CD single was issued in January 2015, and sent to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as part of the submission process to be considered for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The single was included in the list of 79 contenders for the award, but it did not receive a nomination.A lyric video was uploaded onto The Weinstein Company's YouTube channel on January 13, 2015. It was a minute and 35 seconds, and featured clips from the film. The video received over two million views in 24 hours. The video featured scenes from the film in which \\"the iconic Peruvian bear finds himself in all manner of mishaps while trying to find a home and ultimately working his way into our hearts\\". The visual was included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Paddington along with a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of the track.

Potential 49ers’ target Treadwell won’t run at NFL combine Photo: Albert Cesare, Associated Press Potential 49ers’ target Treadwell won’t run at NFL combine So just how fast in Mississippi wide receiver Laquon Treadwell? The answer won’t be provided this week in Indianapolis. Treadwell, the consensus top wide receiver in the draft and a logical first-round target for the 49ers, won’t run the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine, GM Junior Scouting reported. Treadwell has tremendous size (6-3, 220) and impressive production (82 catches, 1,153 yards and 11 TDs in 2015), but they are questions about his giddy-up-and-go. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper said on a conference call this morning that Treadwell’s 40-yard-dash time could determine whether or not he’s a top-10 selection. “If he runs a good 40, he’s a top-10 pick,” said Kiper, who was unaware Treadwell wouldn’t run at the combine. “Big. Strong. Physical. Great hands. Great concentration. Toughness. You look at what (Bears wideout) Alshon Jeffery’s done in the NFL, he could have every bit as good of a career, if not better … If he runs well, he’s top 10. If he runs just OK, he’s probably mid-first round.” Funny Kiper should mention Jeffery. Actually, it’s not amusing to 49ers fans. In 2012, the 49ers selected Illinois wide receiver A.J. Jenkins (17 career receptions) with the No. 30 overall pick, while the Bears selected Jeffery (252 career catches) 15 picks later. Jenkins, who measured 6-0, 190 pounds at the combine, ran a 4.37 40-yard dash in Indianapolis. Jeffery (6-4, 213) didn’t run at the combine and posted a 4.51 at his pro day. Since selecting Jenkins, 49ers general manager Trent Baalke has noted 40-yard-dash times can be overrated. In 2014, he brought up perhaps the most famous example to illustrate his point. Just how fast was Jerry Rice? Answer: fast enough. “(Rice) didn’t have a great 40 time, but his play speed - how many people ever saw him caught, run down?” Trent Baalke said before the 2014 draft. “He played fast.” Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon.

This March, the entire Playboy catalog will be made available for the iPad in all its uncensored glory -- photo spreads, centerfolds and all -- magazine founder Hugh Hefner confirmed on Twitter. \\"Big news! Playboy -- both old & new -- will be available on iPad beginning in March,\\" Hefner tweeted on his official feed. \\"The iPad version of Playboy will include the whole magazine from the first issue to the latest.” Hefner made explicit what users of the app would see: “Playboy on iPad will be uncensored,” he said. The men's magazine will be produced by digital magazine publisher Bondi Digital, which admitted that it was powering the eye-popping iPad app. \\"I can confirm that we are in development with them,\\" Bondi co-founder David Anthony told FoxNews.com. \\"You'll be able to access [Playboy] via the browser in your tablet and use the same password to access it on your computer\\" -- where you'll be able see far, far more than just the stories. The announcement comes out of left field, given Apple’s notorious censorship policy. The company has a range of restrictions on apps to eliminate content it deems explicit, such as pornography, gambling, drugs and even file-sharing. Apple claims the right to reject any app that it feels is in violation of its terms of services. Some have speculated that Apple was rethinking this policy, in the wake of the announcement by CEO Steve Jobs that he was taking time off to focus on his health. When contacted by FoxNews.com, Apple declined to comment. Playboy spokesman Theresa Hennessey clarified Hefner's statement, telling FoxNews.com that the comely centerfolds and sensual snaps from the magazine won't be available in an iPad app after all. \\"We are releasing a web-based subscription service with Bondi Digital Publishing that will give users access to every issue of Playboy both past and present. The service will be iPad-compatible and will utilize iPad functions,\\" Hennessey said. But never fear, loyal readers! Hennessey revealed that Playboy's engineers “also have plans to release a non-nude version of a Playboy-branded iPad app in the coming months that adheres to all of Apple’s policies and guidelines.” Hefner’s somewhat misleading statements highlight a loophole in Apple’s closed ecosystem: the fine line that separates the iPad experience through an app from the experience of a website tailor-made for tablets -- which Apple has limited editorial control over. Those seeking Playboy's titillating photos will access Bondi's custom website, not the app, which will -- of course -- be censored. The closed system is unfortunate, Anthony said, preventing an entire class of VERY visual magazines from reaching consumer eyeballs on the glossy digital screen. \\"The thing that I think is so fascinating about tablets is that the user experience is very natural for turning pages and zooming in on them,\\" he told FoxNews.com. Apple's editorial control over apps \\"prevents certain kinds of magazines from going through that outlet,\\" he noted. That's where Bondi comes in. Anthony hopes that with his company’s technology, the power to choose now once again lies in the hands of the consumer. “The idea from our perspective was to get in as much of that functionality as humanly possible, via the web app we’re creating,” Anthony said. The underlying technology is already being used to archive the Playboy catalog online as well as other print magazines such as Rolling Stone. Bondi is currently working on switching from the Microsoft Silverlight platform to HTML 5 to ensure that the site will work smoothly on the iPad come the March launch. \\"I think that consumers will ultimately decide what content they want,\\" he said. \\"We feel it's our job to make it as accessible as possible for Playboy readers.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Playboy's announcement in January 2011 that its entire catalog, including uncensored photo spreads and centerfolds, would be made available on the iPad in March of the same year. The announcement came as a surprise, considering Apple's notorious censorship policy, which restricts apps containing explicit content such as pornography, gambling, drugs, and file-sharing. The iPad version of Playboy was scheduled to be made available through a custom website by digital magazine publisher Bondi Digital, not an app, thereby bypassing Apple's strict guidelines.

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of the New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \\"The ruling monarch of the mind.\\" Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \\"awkward\\", as Millikan \\"had a penchant for patriotic militarism,\\" where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \\"highly emotional temperament,\\" from which came his \\"extraordinary intellectual energy.\\" Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory. Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premier a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests.

I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film. It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone. Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products. And don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art. If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as \\"Irreversable\\". The distinction here is that \\"Irreversable\\" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. \\"Descent\\" is about date rape. No less disgusting. No less depraved. Just different. This is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep. Had the character \\"Maya\\" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. But seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening. \\"Jared\\" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. How could \\"Maya\\" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her \\"Jared's\\" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined. The film as a whole is beautiful. The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on \\"Maya\\" and the silent inner workings of her mind. All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything. My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; \\"Maya\\" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune. I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do. Bottom line, I think this was the best film of 2007, hands down. Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered. Death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. It's only the last thing that will happen in this existence. The worst things that happen never leave you. They are always in your thoughts. When you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a Christmas present, when you tie your shoe; they haunt you. They haunt you until that last thing releases you. Treat yourself. Challenge yourself. Watch this film. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is positive. The reviewer praises the film \\"Descent\\" for its artful approach, powerful storytelling, and the performances of its actors, particularly Rosario Dawson.

A hybridization is a cross between two individuals that have different traits. A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined is called a monohybrid cross . The offspring of such a cross are called monohybrids. Mendel noted that hybridizing true-breeding (P generation) plants gave rise to an F 1 generation that showed only one trait of a characteristic.

Mendel wanted to know what happened to the white-flowers. If indeed a \\"heritable factor\\" for white-flower had disappeared, all future offspring of the hybrids would be purple-flowered - none would be white. To test this idea, Mendel let the F 1 generation plants self-pollinate and then planted the resulting seeds.

First and foremost, Randy's rice had the perfect balance of texture and flavor. Each grain was cooked to just the right consistency, allowing it to hold its shape while still retaining a slightly chewy and moist mouthfeel. This showed exceptional attention to detail and understanding of the cooking process. Next, Randy's dish exhibited an impressive harmony of flavors. Seasoned with just the right amount of salt and spices, his rice boasted a subtle yet full-bodied flavor profile. The complexity of tastes in Randy's dish was further enhanced by the addition of an array of skillfully combined ingredients. Each element worked harmoniously to create a well-rounded and satisfying dish that left a lasting impression on the judge's palate. In contrast, William's rice fell short in terms of both texture and flavor. Though it wasn't bad, it was slightly overcooked and had a more mushy texture than ideal. Additionally, the seasoning was not quite on point; a hint too much salt overshadowed the other flavors in the dish, making it less appealing than Randy's version. Finally, the presentation of Randy's dish played a significant role in the judge's decision. The rice was beautifully plated, with vibrant colors and garnishes that made the dish visually appealing and enticed the judge to take a bite. William's presentation, while neat and clean, lacked the same creative flair and visual impact. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it was clear that Randy's rice outshone William's in terms of texture, flavor, and presentation, ultimately leading to the judge's decision. The victory was a testament to Randy's dedication to refining his culinary skills and his ability to create dishes that not only taste great but also create a memorable experience for those fortunate enough to dine on his creations."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

After the meeting, Bruce begs his boss, Jack Baylor (Philip Baker Hall), to consider him for the open anchor position.Later that night, Bruce watches the news with his live-in girlfriend, Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), at a middle-class but homey one-bedroom apartment. Sitting on the couch with their dog, Grace tries unsuccessfully to enlist Bruce's help with a photo album commemorating highlights of their relationship, but Bruce is too preoccupied with feeling sorry for himself until he happens upon an x-rated photo of them making love, and whisks Grace off to the bedroom.The next morning, Bruce drops Grace off at the Red Cross to give blood. He's still in a bad mood, so she gives him her prayer beads, saying he needs them more than she does. Bruce reluctantly takes the prayer beads, which are useless to him since he never prays, and makes fun of Grace for wasting her time giving blood.At the station, Bruce learns he's being sent into the field to cover an important story at Niagara Falls, assuming from this apparent promotion that he is in line for the anchor position that just...

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely?","output":"Based on the given review, \\"Just put it Lol,\\" it is difficult to make a concrete recommendation of the app to a friend due to the brevity and ambiguity of the feedback. To provide a detailed and long answer, I will go through each recommendation option and explain the rationale behind choosing or not choosing it. 1. Not at all: This recommendation level indicates a strong disapproval or dislike of the app. This could be due to its performance, interface, features, or other factors. However, the given review does not provide sufficient context or information for us to conclude that the user had a negative experience with the app. The user mentioned \\"Lol,\\" which might suggest a lighthearted or relaxed attitude, indicating that the app may not be entirely negative. Therefore, \\"Not at all\\" might not be the most appropriate recommendation. 2. No: A \\"No\\" recommendation implies that you would not recommend the app to a friend, and it usually stems from some problems or dissatisfaction with the product. Again, due to the ambiguity of the review, it is hard to determine if the user encountered any issues or found the app underwhelming. In this case, there is not enough evidence to support a \\"No\\" recommendation. 3. Maybe: A \\"Maybe\\" recommendation is a middle-ground response that reflects uncertainty or a lack of a strong opinion about the app, either positive or negative. Due to the lack of information supplied in the review, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment regarding the app's suitability for a friend. \\"Maybe\\" would be an appropriate response as it highlights the need for more information before making a recommendation. 4. Yes: A \\"Yes\\" recommendation implies a positive experience with the app. It might suggest that the app is functional, enjoyable, or useful to some extent. As the review provides limited information, we cannot confidently determine whether the user had a good experience. Nevertheless, the \\"Lol\\" might imply a lighthearted or entertaining aspect, which might push the recommendation towards \\"Yes.\\" However, without further context, it remains uncertain. 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation represents a strong endorsement, often implying that the app excels in its purpose, functionality, or enjoyment. Given the brevity and ambiguity of the review, not enough data supports such a strong recommendation. Therefore, \\"Definitely\\" would not be appropriate based solely on the provided feedback. In conclusion, since the review offers minimal details, the most reasonable recommendation leans towards the \\"Maybe\\" option. It conveys the uncertainty and lack of sufficient context to make a confident judgment about the app's quality or usefulness. Before providing a more definitive recommendation for the app, acquiring more detailed and comprehensive feedback or personal experience with it would be essential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: where did the majority of italian immigrants settled??","output":"The majority of Italian immigrants settled in the United States, primarily in the urban areas of the northeastern region, as well as in the cities of the Midwestern and Western states. This significant wave of immigration took place mainly from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, and the choices of destinations were influenced by various factors such as employment opportunities, existing Italian communities, and family connections.  Between 1880 and 1924, approximately four million Italian immigrants arrived in the United States, with the majority of them coming from the impoverished regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. This population movement was driven primarily by factors such as poverty, limited prospects for social and economic mobility, and political instability in Italy. As a result, Italian immigrants sought better living conditions, jobs, and opportunities in other countries, primarily the United States. The majority of these Italian immigrants settled in the northeastern urban areas, specifically in cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. These locations offered numerous employment opportunities, particularly in industries such as garment manufacturing, construction, mining, and railroad building. For instance, New York City, the most significant Italian immigrant destination in the United States, saw the establishment of several Italian neighborhoods within its boroughs, including Little Italy in downtown Manhattan, Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. Italian immigrants also made their way to other regions within the United States. In the Midwest, Chicago and Detroit attracted a sizable number of Italian immigrants, many of whom found employment in factories, automobile manufacturing, steel mills, and meatpacking. In the West, cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver saw the growth of Italian communities, as immigrants became involved in industries such as fishing, agriculture, and wine production. In addition to economic opportunities, Italian immigrants often chose their destinations based on connections, family ties, and existing Italian communities. Chain migration played a crucial role in the settlement patterns of Italian immigrants, as they were more likely to choose cities and towns where friends and family members had already successfully established themselves. This sense of community and connection to their Italian heritage helped to create cultural enclaves and neighborhoods where the language, customs, and traditions of Italy were preserved and passed onto future generations. While the United States was the primary destination for Italian immigrants, other countries also saw an influx of Italians during this period, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Australia. However, the United States remained the most popular destination due to its promise of economic prosperity, personal freedom, and a chance for a better life far away from the challenges and strife faced in Italy at the time. Today, the legacy of Italian immigration continues to shape the cultural, economic, and social fabric of the United States, as well as the lives of millions of Italian-Americans who call this country home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jerry A:","output":"Title: \\"The Labyrinth Below\\" Introduction: In a small, tranquil town, two seemingly ordinary teenagers, Jerry and Becky, stumble upon a dark secret that has been lurking beneath their town for centuries. Determined to explore and uncover the truth, the duo finds themselves entangled in a twisted game of survival and betrayal. Plot: Jerry, the high school's basketball star with a flair for adrenaline, and Becky, a budding investigative journalist for the school paper, are initially brought together by a mysterious article Becky finds in the local archives, revealing a hidden door in the basement of an abandoned house. Intrigued, the duo teams up to investigate and eventually discovers a hidden network of underground catacombs running beneath their town. As they delve deeper into the catacombs, the pair stumbles upon a small room where they find an ancient-looking artifact - a compass intricately crafted from precious metals and adorned in cryptic markings. Unbeknownst to them, the compass holds the power to control the labyrinth-turned-prison, designed to keep a powerful supernatural entity at bay. When they remove the compass from its resting place, the labyrinth's walls begin to shift, the door slams shut, and Jerry and Becky find themselves trapped inside. As they navigate the ever-changing maze, they encounter strange creatures that have been living in the darkness, feeding off of the energy of the imprisoned entity. These grotesque beings pursue them through the labyrinth, forcing Jerry and Becky to rely on their wits and instincts to stay alive. Meanwhile, the enigmatic force they have unwittingly unleashed grows stronger, its whispers infiltrating their minds and fueling doubts about each other's intentions. Along the way, Jerry and Becky come across other lost souls who have also fallen victim to the labyrinth. By working with these new friends, Jerry and Becky must learn the origins of the curse that befalls their town. They discover that the only way to break the curse is to reunite the compass with its guardian - a force that once kept the labyrinth stable and the supernatural entity in check. But this comes at a cost that Jerry and Becky are forced to face - the truth about their past, the truth about their families, and the truth about their town. Pushed to their physical and emotional limits, Jerry and Becky must fight their way through the treacherous labyrinth, all while the labyrinth slowly encroaches upon the surface, threatening to swallow their town whole. At times, it seems like the trust between our heroes is strained beyond repair, but ultimately their shared past drives them together in the face of adversity. In a climactic final confrontation, Jerry and Becky square off against the now-unshackled supernatural entity, obliterating it with teamwork, newfound allies' aid, and the guardianship of the now-returned force bound within the compass. As the entity dissipates, the labyrinth shifts back into stability, revealing the long-lost exit door. Conclusion: Jerry and Becky escape from the basement, clutching the compass that ended the curse that plagued their town. The experience has changed their lives forever and has left an indelible bond between them. As they walk back into the sunlight, Jerry and Becky realize the scope of the nightmarish ordeal they have been through, but also feel a sense of gratitude for the friendships formed and the personal growth they experienced during this harrowing journey. The adventure has turned Jerry and Becky into local legends, and the story of their bravery will live on in their town's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is my reasoning: 1. Subject and Verb Agree: The subject \\"I\\" and the verb \\"climbed\\" are in agreement. In English grammar, subject-verb agreement is important. Here, both are in the first-person singular, so they agree. 2. Verb tense is correct: The verb \\"climbed\\" is in past simple tense, indicating a completed action in the past. This is appropriate considering the context of the sentence. 3. Preposition use: The preposition \\"up\\" and \\"the\\" are used correctly in relation to the noun \\"tree\\". \\"Up\\" indicating direction and \\"the\\" is a definite article which refers to a specific tree familiar to the speaker and the listener. 4. Meaning clear: The sentence's overall meaning is clear to someone with a standard understanding of English. Thus, the syntax (or sentence structure) is correct. So, based on the subject-verb agreement, correct use of verb tense, appropriate preposition, and clear meaning, a linguist would probably deem this sentence as linguistically acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose double triumph in piano and voice resulted in being awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival? is inside the article: In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps,..., can you guess it ?

Options: - tropical forests - dictionary - amazon basin - congo - tropical rain forest  Explain why a human would choose \\"amazon basin\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"The Amazon basin is the most likely answer to the question because it is consistent with the existing knowledge we have about the behaviors and habitats of sloths, and the languages spoken in various geographic regions. Firstly, let's dissect the question. It specifically mentions that the sloth hears Portuguese being spoken nearby. The official language of Brazil, which covers the largest portion of the Amazon basin, is Portuguese. Therefore, if the sloth is near humans speaking Portuguese, there is a high likelihood that it is in a region where Portuguese is the predominant language, such as Brazil. Secondly, the sloth's reaction of cowering when it hears humans indicates that the sloth is in an environment where it naturally resides but where humans might intrude, again pointing towards a natural habitat rather than a human-centered location like a zoo or a city. Now, let's analyze the options provided. Four out of the five options refer to a natural environment: tropical forests, the Amazon basin, Congo, and tropical rainforests. Among these, the Congo is in Africa where Portuguese is not the main language spoken, so it can be eliminated. The terms 'tropical forests' and 'tropical rain forest' are more generic terms and could technically apply to many regions around the world, not specifically to a Portuguese-speaking region.  On the other hand, the Amazon Basin, covering a significant part of South America and mostly in Brazil, corresponds perfectly to the geographic distribution of sloths and to a region where Portuguese is prevalently spoken. Sloths typically inhabit tropical rainforests, and the Amazon Basin is noted for its extensive tropical rainforests. Therefore, giving the provided details, the Amazon basin would be the best fit for the location of the sloths who can hear Portuguese.  Finally, the option 'dictionary' is not a physical location where a sloth or a language could naturally exist, and so this option can be swiftly discarded.  In conclusion, considering all the cognitive cues in the question and the available options, a human would choose \\"Amazon basin\\" as it fits best within the known habitats of sloths and the geographic regions where Portuguese is spoken."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The given sentence in Czech, \\"Ok, tak proč by nám to Rafaelova matka říkala, Chino?\\" translates to English as: \\"Okay, so why would Rafael's mother tell us that, Chino?\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Ok\\" remains the same in English, as it is a commonly understood word across many languages. 2. \\"tak\\" in Czech is an informal connector word used similarly to \\"so\\" or \\"well\\" in English, signaling a transition between ideas. 3. \\"proč\\" translates to \\"why,\\" indicating a question is being asked. 4. \\"by\\" is a conditional particle in Czech, which, combined with \\"nám\\" meaning \\"us,\\" helps create the conditional phrase \\"would...tell us\\" in English. 5. \\"to\\" means \\"that\\" or \\"it\\" in English. In this context, it is understood as \\"that,\\" referring to some previously mentioned piece of information or statement. 6. \\"Rafaelova matka\\" consists of \\"Rafaelova\\" (Rafael's) and \\"matka\\" (mother), which when combined, result in \\"Rafael's mother.\\" 7. \\"říkala\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"říkat,\\" meaning \\"to say\\" or \\"to tell.\\" In this context, it is translated as \\"tell\\" with a focus on relaying information. 8.

First, let's move the +20 from the right side of the \\"=\\" to the left side by subtracting 20 from both sides. When we do that, our equation will look like this:    -28 - 20 = -16 * f 2. Now let's do the subtraction on the left side:    -48 = -16 * f 3. We want to find out what \\"f\\" is, so now we need to divide both sides by -16:    -48 / -16 = f 4.

Write an article based on this summary: Ricky Burns suffered his first defeat in seven years as he lost his WBO world lightweight title to Terence Crawford on a unanimous points decision. Article:","output":"Title: Terence Crawford Dethrones Ricky Burns, Ending Seven-Year Winning Streak On Saturday night, Ricky Burns faced his first defeat in seven years, losing his WBO world lightweight title to Terence Crawford following a unanimous points decision. The unexpected result marks a significant moment in both fighters' careers and has stunned fans worldwide. Ricky Burns, a Scottish professional boxer who formerly held the WBO world lightweight title, entered the match riding a wave of impressive victories. The fight was expected to be a true showcase of the 36-year-old's resilience and unblemished winning streak. However, the night ended in disappointment as Terence Crawford, the 34-year-old American challenger, rose to the occasion in spectacular fashion, ultimately ending Burns' impressive run. The match took place at the famous SSE Hydro arena in Glasgow, with a rabidly supportive hometown crowd cheering for Burns. The anticipation leading up to the fight was palpable. Both fighters appeared determined and confident during their pre-fight interviews, with Burns expressing his desire to retain his title and Crawford stating his intent to take it. Right from the opening bell, it was apparent that Crawford would be the one who dominated the fight. Despite Burns demonstrating his excellent footwork and employing his jab effectively, Crawford pressed relentlessly, proving to be an aggressive and skilled counter puncher. Crawford's southpaw stance seemed to throw Burns off his game, and the American continued to take advantage of this throughout the match. While Burns did manage to land some solid punches and responded well to Crawford's attacks, it was the latter's vicious left hooks and rapid combinations that left a mark. Burns was often seen retreating and trying to find space to regroup, but Crawford expertly cornered and punished the Scottish champion.  As the fight went on, it became increasingly evident that without a knockout blow, Burns would struggle to secure a victory that night. While both fighters showcased grit and determination, Crawford's technique, speed, and power were simply too much for the defending champion. After twelve grueling rounds, the judges made their unanimous decision, scoring the fight 116-112, 117-111, and 116-112 in favor of Crawford, who walked away with the WBO world lightweight title. His triumphant victory puts him at the forefront of the lightweight division and is a testament to his skills as a contender. For Ricky Burns, the loss marks a bitter end to a phenomenal seven-year winning streak. However, his place in the annals of boxing history remains secure, with many still considering him to be one of Scotland's greatest boxers. While it is undoubtedly a disappointing setback in his career, Burns has an opportunity to learn from the fight and come back stronger in the future. In the ever-evolving and unpredictable sport of boxing, the Terence Crawford vs. Ricky Burns bout showcased once again that nothing is certain within the squared circle. As both fighters move forward in their respective careers, fans will be eager to see how they fare in the bouts that lie ahead."},{"instruction":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Cats Don't Dance Movie plot: In 1939, Danny, an optimistic cat, dreams of Hollywood stardom, so he travels from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood in hopes of starting a career there. After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios â such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth the head of Mammoth Studios, and Flanagan the film's director, is giving an interview, getting the animals blame and fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to leave for home, Cranston, Frances, and T.W. blame him for ruining their careers while Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny. After a comment from the bus driver...

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem.

This becomes no ordinary domestic quarrel when their tensions escalate beyond a war of words to hurtful, spiteful deeds and then to climatic physical violence. Hollywood icons Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh are given close, tight photography in their lengthy scenes of escalating conflict, played with such deep insight and such technical brilliance that the audience is given pause, from moment to moment. to decide whether one really has a point and the other should really be apprehended by the authorities.

Q: Question: Who was the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire when Mehmed became Sultan for the first time? Passage:This is a list of campaigns personally led by Mehmed II or Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (30 March 1432 – 3 May 1481) (Ottoman Turkish: محمد ثانى, Meḥmed-i s̠ānī; Turkish: II. Mehmet; also known as el-Fātiḥ, الفاتح, \\"the Conqueror\\" in Ottoman Turkish; in modern Turkish, Fatih Sultan Mehmet; also called Mahomet II in early modern Europe) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire twice, first for a short time from 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to 1481. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire, transforming the Ottoman state into an empire. Mehmed continued his conquests in Asia, with the Anatolian reunification, and in Europe, as far as Bosnia and Croatia. Mehmed II is regarded as a national hero in Turkey, and Istanbul's Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge is named after him.  Links: a. Istanbul b. Croatia c. Ottoman Turkish language d.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. broom  B. effort  C. vacuuming  D. boredom  E. mop Answer:","output":"C. Vacuuming When it comes to removing dirt from a carpet while doing housework, the most suitable option from the choices provided is vacuuming.  Using a vacuum cleaner is the most effective and efficient method for cleaning and removing dirt, dust, and debris from carpets. Vacuum cleaners are designed specifically for cleaning carpets and other floor surfaces through a combination of suction and mechanical agitation. Most vacuum cleaners have rotating brushes that help loosen dirt and particles which are then drawn up by the powerful suction of the vacuum, making it an essential tool for carpet cleaning. Let's further discuss why vacuuming is the most suitable option and compare it with the other given choices: A. Broom - While a broom can help to remove some dirt and debris from a carpet, it is not as effective or efficient as a vacuum cleaner. Brooms may only move the dirt and dust around on the carpet instead of properly removing it. Additionally, brooms are better suited for cleaning hard surfaces rather than carpets. B. Effort - While effort is a necessary component when it comes to cleaning, it is not a specific tool or method for removing dirt from a carpet. Effort alone will not effectively clean the carpet without utilizing proper cleaning tools and methods, such as vacuuming. D. Boredom - Boredom is an emotional state and not a tool or method for removing dirt from a carpet. It has no relevance to effectively cleaning a carpet. E. Mop - Mops are designed for cleaning hard floor surfaces, such as tiles or linoleum. Using a mop on a carpet would not effectively remove dirt and could potentially damage the carpet fibers and even introduce moisture, leading to mold and mildew growth. Mops are not suitable for carpet cleaning. In conclusion, vacuuming is the most suitable option for removing dirt from a carpet while doing housework. Vacuum cleaners provide the necessary suction power and mechanical agitation to effectively remove dirt, dust, and debris from carpets, ensuring a clean and healthy living environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

To enter a game show ..","output":"Based on the context provided in the questionnaire in question, the reason for making guesses about the questions is not explicitly specified. However, analyzing the nature of the questions can provide us with a clearer understanding. The two questions are related to the quantities of products produced for a Farmer's Market, indicating that the setting might be informal, perhaps business-oriented. The inquiry does not seem to be connected to an academic setting, rendering options B (To pass a class) and C (To pass a test), unlikely. These options suggest an educational context, specifically in a scenario where you are taking a class or test that requires the submission of detailed answers or educated guesses based on given information. Also, option D (To enter a game show) seems improbable too. Game shows typically have a wide range of trivia-based questions that do not often focus on personal, individualized information. The specificity of these questions regarding exact flour usage and bagel quantity pertains more to the context of the Farmer's Market activity than to broad-based game show trivia content. On the other hand, option A (To enter a giveaway) seems more plausible. Giveaways, especially in a community or informal business setting, like a Farmer's Market, often engage participants to make educated guesses on specific aspects (pertaining to product quantities or sales, in this case). These questions could efficiently engage the audience and garner participation, with the closest answer receiving a prize or reward. Hence, based on the information available in the questions and the nature of the context, it can be inferred that the likely reason for guessing these questions' answers would be to enter a giveaway."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: If Britain votes to leave the European Union it could have a negative impact on the Nato alliance, a senior US military commander has warned.","output":"Title: Brexit and Its Potential Impact on NATO Alliance: Concerns Voiced by Senior US Military Commander Introduction Brexit, the term commonly used to describe the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, raises concerns among nations worldwide. Many fear that should Britain proceed with its departure, the security and economy of not only the UK but also the European Union will be at risk. A senior US military commander has recently warned that Britain’s exit from the EU could have a negative impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, causing further ripples on the global scale with potential consequences for stability and cooperation worldwide. Background of NATO and Brexit The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, is an intergovernmental military alliance established in 1949. The member countries commit to a mutual defense policy in response to an attack by any external aggression. With its 30 member countries across Europe and North America, NATO aims to maintain international peace and stability. The United Kingdom's influence as a prominent NATO member is significant, contributing immensely to the multinational cooperation that underpins NATO's mission. Brexit, too, cannot be overlooked. Following a referendum held in the UK on June 23, 2016, nearly 52% of voters chose to leave the European Union, triggering a series of heated debates and negotiations. It wasn't until January 31, 2020, that the UK officially left the EU, maintaining certain economic ties until December 31, 2020. Impact on NATO Brexit has created an atmosphere of uncertainty in the international community, especially regarding the possible destabilization of the EU's economic and political landscape. This uncertainty also extends to NATO, with multiple concerns raised on how the UK's withdrawal from the EU could potentially impact the alliance. Highlighting several areas of potential risk, the senior US military commander's warning brings forth the growing apprehension on the international stage. 1. Weakening European Defense Cooperation The UK's departure might weaken European defense cooperation, as one of the key military powers in Europe is now to be excluded from EU defense and security meetings. This move could potentially result in decreased collaborative efforts between NATO and the EU, further straining their strategic partnership. 2. Military Spending Brexit may also negatively affect military spending. Post-Brexit, the UK may face economic challenges that could lead to budget cuts, which could ultimately trickle down to defense budgets. Such a change could hamper NATO's effectiveness in maintaining a reliable defense establishment, as the UK is one of the key players in the alliance’s structure. 3. Concerns Over US Involvement Furthermore, the potential weakening of NATO's effectiveness may also lead to skepticism from the United States. If the European member states appear less committed to their alliance responsibilities, the United States might re-evaluate its involvement and prioritize their interests elsewhere. 4. Emergence of New Security Threats Brexit might also contribute to the rise of new security threats. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU creates opportunities for hostile nations to exploit the political and economic turmoil, potentially sowing discord among NATO members. This could result in decreased coordination and trust between nations, making it more challenging for the alliance to execute operations effectively. Conclusion Brexit is a complex issue with far-reaching implications, both for the nation leaving the Union as well as for its neighbors. The possible negative impact on the NATO alliance, as warned by the senior US military commander, is one such concern that merits attention. The future effectiveness of NATO and its ability to maintain international peace and stability will largely depend on the alliance's adaptive capabilities and the commitment of its member countries. As the challenges posed by Brexit continue to unfold, cooperation and communication between nations will be crucial to ensuring that the bond between NATO members remains robust, secure, and faithful to its founding principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Paragraph: The molecular events and evolutionary forces underlying lethal mutagenesis of virus (or virus extinction through an excess of mutations) are not well understood. Here we apply for the first time phylogenetic methods and Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ) to monitor genetic distances and intra-population structures of mutant spectra of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) quasispecies subjected to mutagenesis by base and nucleoside analogues. Results: Phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have revealed a highly dynamic variation of intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies. The population diversity first suffers striking expansions in the presence of mutagens and then compressions either when the presence of the mutagenic analogue was discontinued or when a mutation that decreased sensitivity to a mutagen was selected. The pattern of mutations found in the populations was in agreement with the behavior of the corresponding nucleotide analogues with FMDV in vitro. Mutations accumulated at preferred genomic sites, and dn/ds ratios indicate the operation of negative (or purifying) selection in populations subjected to mutagenesis. No evidence of unusually elevated genetic distances has been obtained for FMDV populations approaching extinction. Phylogenetic and PAQ analysis provide adequate procedures to describe the evolution of viral sequences subjected to lethal mutagenesis. These methods define the changes of intra-population structure more precisely than mutation frequencies and Shannon entropies. PAQ is very sensitive to variations of intrapopulation genetic distances. Strong negative (or purifying) selection operates in FMDV populations subjected to enhanced mutagenesis. The quantifications provide evidence that extinction does not imply unusual increases of intrapopulation complexity, in support of the lethal defection model of virus extinction.

Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources. When rivers are dammed, people use the water for   _  . A) keeping the rivers clean B) making electricity C) washing clothes D) irrigation and the production of electricity A:","output":"D) Irrigation and the production of electricity Rivers are indeed one of our most important natural resources, providing a myriad of benefits to the surrounding areas in which they flow. From transportation to food sources, rivers have played a crucial role in shaping human civilization. Additionally, these rivers have given rise to some of the world's most thriving and historically significant cities, such as those located on the banks of the Mississippi, Nile, Ganges, Congo, Mekong, and Amazon rivers. One significant way in which rivers contribute to the well-being of the areas they pass through is by providing water for irrigation and the production of electricity. To harness this precious resource, engineers construct dams across river channels, allowing a lake to form behind the dam. This stored water can then be released in a controlled manner, providing a reliable source of water for the surrounding agriculture and helping to mitigate the effects of drought and water scarcity. Moreover, hydroelectric power plants can be built as part of the dam structure to generate electricity. This form of renewable energy is created through the conversion of the potential energy stored in the water to kinetic energy as the water flows through turbines, ultimately generating electrical power. This clean and sustainable method of power generation is an essential component of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels. However, large cities and industries that are situated on rivers can also contribute to pollution-related problems, as the water may become contaminated with chemicals and other waste materials. This pollution poses a threat to the health of both the local ecosystem and human populations, who rely on these rivers for their drinking water and other essential needs. Recognizing the importance of preserving the health of these vital resources, people are increasingly becoming aware of the need to implement measures to keep rivers clean and protect their diverse benefits. By doing so, they safeguard not only the environment but also the livelihoods and well-being of countless communities around the world that depend on rivers for their sustenance, transportation, and enjoyment. In conclusion, rivers provide a multitude of benefits, and when they are dammed, the water is primarily used for irrigation and the production of electricity. While cities and industries may pose challenges to the health of rivers, efforts to preserve and maintain these natural resources are essential for the continued prosperity of the lands and peoples they serve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The underlying idea expressed in both instances is that Spain acknowledged the status of Irish nobles as equals to Spaniards and granted them the right to claim Spanish citizenship. Let's break down the sentences to examine their components: 1. \\"Spain recognized Irish nobles on equal footing as Spaniards, and Irish could claim Spanish citizenship.\\" In this sentence, the phrase \\"on equal footing\\" is used to indicate that Spanish authorities treated Irish nobles on the same level as their Spanish counterparts. Additionally, the word \\"Irish\\" is used to refer to Irish people in general, implying that they had the opportunity to claim Spanish citizenship. 2. \\"Spain recognized Irish nobles as Spaniards on equal terms, and Irish citizens could claim Spanish citizenship.\\" In this variation, the phrase \\"as Spaniards on equal terms\\" emphasizes that Irish nobles were seen as equal to Spaniards. The term \\"Irish citizens\\" is employed here to specify that Irish individuals with citizenship status had the right to claim Spanish citizenship. Despite the differences in phrasing, both sentences ultimately express the same idea.

Red: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany.

Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

Plot title: Austin Powers: Goldmember Movie plot: Dr. Evil plans to travel back in time to 1975 and bring back Johan van der Smut, aka \\"Goldmember\\", who developed a cold fusion unit for a tractor beam which Dr. Evil names \\"Preparation H\\". He intends to use the tractor beam to pull a meteor into the Earth, striking the polar ice caps and causing a global flood. Moments after this plan is revealed, Austin Powers and the British Secret Service attack the base and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted for his services, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. Basil Exposition later informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped, and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold. Austin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil, who tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's roller disco club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is undercover as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape.

We have this equation: -306 = 21614*r - 21631*r First, let's combine the terms with \\"r\\" in them. Since both terms have \\"r,\\" we can treat them like we're just adding or subtracting numbers: 21614*r - 21631*r = (21614 - 21631) * r We need to subtract 21631 from 21614, which gives us -17. So now our equation looks like this: -306 = -17 * r Now, to find out what \\"r\\" is, we need to do the opposite of multiplying by -17. The opposite of multiplying is dividing. So, let's divide both sides of the equation by -17: (-306) / (-17) = (-17 * r) / (-17) When we divide -306 by -17, we get 18 (because a negative number divided by a negative number becomes a positive number): 18 = r There we go!

Answer based on context: The Jets began their 2007 campaign at home for a Week 1 divisional match-up with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, New York immediately trailed as QB Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Wes Welker for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Jets tied the game with QB Chad Pennington completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  However, the Patriots retook the lead with Brady completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. On the opening kickoff for the third quarter, New York trailed even more as CB Ellis Hobbs returned the kickoff an NFL record 108&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, New England continued his onslaught as Brady completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss.  The Jets would get their last score of the game with Pennington & Coles hooking up with each other again on a 1-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots would take over for the rest of the game as kicker Stephen Gostkowski nailed a 22-yard field goal, while FB Heath Evans ended the game with a 1-yard TD run. With the loss, New York began its season at 0-1 while the Patriots began 1-0. On September 10, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. On September 13, Belichick was officially fined 500,000, while the Patriots were also fined 250,000, and forfeited their first round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. If the Patriots had missed the playoffs, they would have instead forfeited their second and third round selections in the 2008 draft. Goodell said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick is effectively the team's general manager as well as head coach, and exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \\"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Belichick later issued a statement in which he apologized for what he called a \\"mistake\\" in his interpretation of the rules. However, he denied ever using videotape to gain an advantage while a game was underway.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774  7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting .

What is the relationship between 'studio wall' and 'adolph von menzel'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'Studio Wall' and 'Adolph von Menzel' is that 'Studio Wall' is an oil painting created by the German artist Adolph von Menzel in 1872. Adolph von Menzel, a German Realist artist of the 19th century, gained prominence for his drawings, etchings, and paintings. He is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, along with Caspar David Friedrich. 'Studio Wall' is a significant artwork in Menzel's career and is considered one of the \\"masterpieces of Menzel's maturity.\\" The artist himself deemed it his best painting. The painting depicts the red-colored wall of Menzel's studio at night, with various plaster casts illuminated from below. The casts displayed in the painting include death masks, portrait busts, life masks, and torsos. The artwork is not only appreciated for its swift execution (alla prima painting) and striking visual composition but also for its deep symbolism and contemplation on the transience of life. Many interpretations of the painting exist, with some art historians suggesting it to be a harmonious example of pictorial unity, while others see it as a coded manifesto that reflects Menzel's rejection of academic canons in favor of a different aesthetic approach. Moreover, 'Studio Wall' has a special significance as it features the central death mask of the artist's friend Friedrich Eggers, the first critic sympathetic to Menzel's work. Eggers passed away in August 1872, and the painting, dating from October of that year, might act as a form of memorial. In summary, the relationship between 'Studio Wall' and 'Adolph von Menzel' lies in the fact that 'Studio Wall' is one of the most significant and acclaimed works painted by Adolph von Menzel, reflecting the artist's unique approach to portraying the transience of life through the depiction of his studio wall and various plaster casts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. falling down  B. provide shelter  C. bud  D. produce fruit  E. back yard  The best answer is Answer:","output":"B. provide shelter After Robinson Crusoe got shipwrecked, he found himself stranded on an uninhabited island where he had to survive for many years. He relied on the resources available on the island, and one such resource was the huge tree that he encountered. This tree became an essential part of his survival strategy, as it provided him with shelter. Shelter is one of the most basic needs for any living being, and in the case of Robinson Crusoe, it was even more critical given his isolated situation and the uncertain conditions of the island. A suitable shelter would serve several purposes, such as protection from the elements, safety from predators or potential dangers on the island, and a comfortable space to rest and plan for his survival. The huge tree proved to be an ideal shelter for Robinson, as its size, structure, and location offered the necessary protection he needed. Furthermore, the tree's branches and leaves provided natural insulation that could help regulate the temperature inside, which could prove crucial during extreme weather conditions. It also offered Robinson a vantage point to survey his surroundings, assess potential dangers, and look out for any passing ships that might help him get off the island. In this context, the other options presented as possible answers do not align with Robinson's needs and priorities after being shipwrecked: A. falling down: This scenario would not be helpful for his survival. C. bud: While the growth of new leaves or branches might indicate a healthy tree, it would not directly contribute to his immediate survival needs. D. produce fruit: Of course, having a source of food nearby would be beneficial, but it doesn't compare to the importance of having a viable shelter. E. back yard: This term does not apply to Robinson's situation, as he was isolated on an uninhabited island without any proper housing facilities. Given the critical importance of shelter for Robinson Crusoe's survival and the role the huge tree played in fulfilling that need, the best answer to the question is B. provide shelter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Attack: The mocked up newspaper which opened Sunday's episode of Sherlock featured a story, headlined 'Thames to become watery motorway' which took a swipe at the London Mayor. The BBC’s raison d’etre to spend the licence fee attacking Conservative politicians, Boris Johnson claimed today after a newspaper in hit show Sherlock branded him ‘dithering, incoherent and self-interested’. The mocked up page did not name Mr Johnson directly, but referred to the ‘current mayor’ and a ‘hair-brained’ (sic) plan to turn the River Thames into a motorway. It said it came after ‘recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed as an alternative to expanding Heathrow. The BBC tried to claim that that the newspaper and mayor featured in Sunday night’s episode were ‘entirely fictional’. But the reference to the Boris Island airport plan and a quote from the ‘mayor’ saying ‘huzzah’ left little doubt who it referred to. Mr Johnson accused the BBC of political bias, but suggested it was in the Corporation’s nature to criticse the Tories. ‘Whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre,’ he told LBC 97.3. ‘If people can’t make fun of politicians what has gone wrong with the BBC. ‘It is unbelievable, unbelievable… I think it’s perfectly legitimate for people to satirise politicians and there you go.’ His criticism of the BBC comes after he told The Times: ‘It is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.’ Sunday’s episode of Sherlock, entitled The Sign of Three, opened with a series of robberies by a gang which police repeatedly failed to catch. Scroll down for video. Bias: Boris Johnson hit back at the political criticism in the newspaper seen in BBC show Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch (right) Bizarre: The newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock as best man. Boris Johnson appeared to compare Nick Clegg to a condom this morning in his latest attack on the Deputy Prime Minister. The Mayor of London said the Liberal Democrat leader was 'there to fulfil a very important. ceremonial function as David Cameron's lapdog come prophylactic. protection device for all the difficult things that David Cameron has to. do that cheese off' the public. The two men, who both take part in regular phone-in shows on LBC 97.3 have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past, with Mr Clegg branding the mayor a \\"slacker\\" for only hosting a monthly call-in on the station while Mr Johnson claimed the DPM was an 'idle bum'. In the opening seconds of the programme a newspaper page spun into view, with the headline ‘Bank gang leave cops clueless’. But underneath it had a story headlined: Thames to become watery motorway. The story, which could only be read by pausing the programme, said: ‘A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink.’ It went on to detail the ‘hair-brained scheme’ to create boats out of the iconic Routemaster bus, which Mr Johnson pledged to bring back to London’s streets. When asked to explain the plan at an event, the ‘mayor’ in the story ‘was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’. The story added that the plan comes. after ‘the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle. of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed. The. newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode,. which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock. as best man. But the. real-life London mayor joked that the real target of the story might. have been his predecessor, Labour’s Ken Livingstone. He. told LBC: ‘I don’t rule out the possibility by the way that this is an. attack on the previous Mayor who after all  himself spent large sums of. public  money on investigating whether there should be a Thames estuary. airport and used to drivel on about putting people on the river. ‘But unlike the previous mayor I actually expanded river transport. Mr Johnson added: ‘We doubled the number of passengers on the river and we are actually getting somewhere at last in sorting our aviation capacity problems. ‘So whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre. I don’t in any way want to discourage them.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Sherlock is a fictional drama series, both the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or politically affiliated.’ A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink. The hair-brained (sic) scheme involved chartering disused boats, paying for their conversion into a version of London's famous bus, the Routemaster, but this plan has already foundered after pilot schemes revealed that customers were walking straight off the boat and into the icy currents of the Thames. When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested. He said, \\"Well the fact of the matter is that Londoners need to recognise our great naval history, rather than naval gazing, and this will get the traffic moving while invoking memories of Nelson and the like. Huzzar! The plan joins a long list of bizarre concepts including the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about a fictional newspaper in the BBC show Sherlock that made fun of the London Mayor at the time, Boris Johnson. The article in the show talked about a silly plan to turn the River Thames into a watery motorway. Boris Johnson thought that the BBC was making fun of him because of his political ideas, and he said they like to spend money attacking Conservative politicians.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise describes a situation where the speaker's wife is not present from Thursday through Monday. The speaker discusses other people's reactions and questions about when the wife might be around. It can be inferred that the individuals asking questions are consistently inquisitive about the wife's absence, which leads the speaker to clarify their spouse will never be present. The hypothesis is that the individuals asking are very pushy about wanting to know when the wife will be home. Based on the information provided in the premise, it can be inferred that the individuals might be persistent or insistent in their inquiries about the wife's presence. While the word \\"pushy\\" implies a more aggressive tone, it can be interpreted as the people being excessively inquisitive. Drawing a connection between the premise and the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the premise does entail the hypothesis to a certain extent. The premise illustrates a situation where people continuously ask about the wife's whereabouts, indicating a strong curiosity in her presence. While the degree to which they are \\"pushy\\" is subjective and not explicitly described, the general implication of their persistent questioning can be seen as supporting the hypothesis. In summary, the premise entails the hypothesis to some extent, as it does reveal a pattern of people being insistent in their inquiries about the wife's presence. It is crucial to note that the term \\"pushy\\" might be subjective, but the general sense of people being persistent about wanting to know when the wife will be home can be deduced from the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?","output":"Based on the provided information, it is impossible to conclusively determine whether Greg's lake will have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's lake. Carbon dioxide levels in a body of water can be influenced by various factors, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and the exchange of gases with the atmosphere. However, there are certain factors we can consider based on the given information: 1. Climate: Greg's farm is in Texas, which generally has a warmer climate compared to Jim's farm in Illinois. Warmer water holds less dissolved carbon dioxide compared to colder water. This might suggest that Greg's lake could have lower levels of dissolved carbon dioxide than Jim's lake. 2. Rain: Jim's farm receives more regular rainfall compared to Greg's farm, which rarely sees rain. Rain can increase the amount of carbon dioxide in a lake through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the introduction of carbon dioxide from runoff. This factor might suggest that Jim's lake could have higher levels of carbon dioxide than Greg's lake. 3. Watering crops: Greg spends much of his day watering his crops, and depending on where he sources the water, this may have an impact on the carbon dioxide levels in his lake. If he uses water from the lake, it might imply that the lake experiences more fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels due to human intervention. 4. Farm activities: Jim spends more time dealing with farm animals, which may produce waste that could enter the lake and lead to increased decomposition and respiration, contributing to higher carbon dioxide levels. However, this is based on the assumption that his farming practices could impact the lake's water quality. Despite these considerations, we still cannot determine with certainty the comparative carbon dioxide levels in Greg's and Jim's lakes. To accurately compare the carbon dioxide levels, water samples would need to be collected and tested from both lakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Who dispensed justice in the New Kingdom for both civil and criminal cases?? from the following article ?  The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: What was the weather like? Answer: A:","output":"The weather was sunny and hot, as the sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road, and tourists had daubs of sunscreen rubbed over their peeling skin. The air conditioning in Manny's van had been giving him trouble, but it was finally working, indicating that there was a need for it due to the warm temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A few high-profile women candidates got a lot of attention on the national stage, but with dramatic Democratic losses, the number of women in Congress will likely hold steady or decrease for the first time since 1987. The first female House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and three Democratic women committee chairs will lose their leadership positions in the majority, and consequently the overall political clout of women in the House will decrease. But not all the news for women in this election was bad. There were winners as well as losers -- and some groups were both.

Analyze the words and phrasing of the sentence. 2. Determine if the words carry a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 3. Infer the overall sentiment of the sentence based on the analysis. Step 1: Analyzing the words and phrasing: - The sentence \\"deserve better\\" suggests that the subject, likely a movie or its elements like actors or plot, should expect or receive something better than what they currently have. Step 2: Determine sentiment: - The word \\"better\\" has a positive connotation, indicating improvement or a higher standard. However, the fact that something \\"deserves better\\" also implies that the current situation is not living up to expectations, which carries a negative sentiment. Step 3: Infer overall sentiment: - Based on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the sentence \\"deserve better\\" can be considered as negative, as it implies that the subject did not reach its potential or fulfill expectations. It conveys disappointment or dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Following the death of Nawal Marwan, a Canadian immigrant, her two children, fraternal twins Jeanne and Simon, meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, a friend of their mother.

Wood is the best material.","output":"When selecting a kitty condo for your beloved feline friend, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure you pick the perfect one. Not only should the cat condo be constructed of high-quality materials such as wood, but it should also have durable coverings that can withstand a cat's natural tendency to scratch and play. Here is a detailed guide to help you choose the perfect kitty condo: 1. Assess your cat's personality and preferences: Before purchasing a kitty condo, take the time to better understand your cat's personality, likes, and dislikes. Are they active and love to climb and explore, or would they prefer a cozy hiding spot to snuggle? Observe your cat's habits and preferred play activities to determine which type of condo will suit their needs. 2. Measure available space in your home: Before selecting a kitty condo, measure the available space in your home to ensure the condo fits appropriately. A too-large condo might make it difficult for your feline friend to navigate their environment, whereas a too-small space may not be as appealing to them. 3. Compare various sizes and designs: Kitty condos come in various sizes, heights, and designs, each with unique features to cater to different feline preferences. Options include multiple levels, hiding spots, scratching posts, hammocks, toys, ramps, and enclosed spaces. Consider your cat's behavior and the available floor space in your home when selecting the ideal size and design. 4. Choose quality wood and coverings: As mentioned, it's crucial to select a kitty condo made of high-quality materials, such as natural wood, for added durability and stability. The coverings should be made of sturdy materials, such as sisal rope for scratching posts and plush fabric for resting areas, to withstand your cat's everyday wear and tear. 5. Examine the stability and structure: For your cat's safety, choose a kitty condo with a stable and sturdy structure. Check the weight capacity and potential tipping points, especially in taller condos with multiple levels. Look for designs with a wide base or reinforced anchor points that prevent the structure from wobbling or toppling over. 6. Consider ease of assembly and cleaning: A kitty condo should be easy to assemble, disassemble, and clean to maintain a hygienic environment for your cat. Removable and washable cushions are a plus, as they make cleaning more manageable. Additionally, some designs include detachable parts, allowing you to switch up the configuration and clean specific sections quickly. 7. Read customer reviews and ask for recommendations: Before making your final decision, read customer reviews and ask fellow cat owners for their personal recommendations. This can provide invaluable insight into the durability, stability, and overall satisfaction other customers and their cats have experienced with various kitty condo options. 8. Set a budget: Finally, set a budget for your kitty condo purchase based on your preferences, available space, and the features required. Price-points can vary significantly, but remember that investing in a high-quality condo with durable materials and thoughtful design can save you money in the long term by reducing the need for replacement due to damage or wear. By carefully considering your cat's personality and preferences, the available space in your home, and the above factors such as quality materials, stability, and design, you can make an informed decision about the ideal kitty condo for your feline friend. Remember to regularly observe your cat's interactions with their new condo, and make adjustments to the configuration, features, and placement as necessary to ensure your cat's continued enjoyment and satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The bee had to be shipped down south to avoid the cold winter, where was it originally from? Possible A: michigan, united states, sky, china, apiary  Why is \\"michigan\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"The answer \\"Michigan\\" aligns with human common sense for several reasons that can be broken down into the following categories: 1. Geographical relevance: Michigan is located in the northern United States, where cold winters with freezing temperatures and snow are common. The question implies that the bee needed to be shipped down south to avoid cold winter, which suggests that its original location experienced freezing temperatures. Michigan fits this description well, as its climate is known to be cold during the winter months. 2. Biological and ecological context: Bees, particularly honey bees, thrive in warmer climates and require suitable conditions to maintain their colonies and carry out pollination. In colder climates like Michigan, bees can struggle to survive during the winter months as the extreme cold can negatively impact their behavior, lifespan, and ability to find food. Therefore, it makes sense that bees might need to be relocated from colder regions like Michigan to a warmer, more hospitable environment to survive the winter months. 3. Comparing the answers: When comparing the answer choices given — Michigan, United States, sky, China, and apiary — \\"Michigan\\" stands out as the most logical choice aligned with common sense. The United States is too broad to imply a specific cold region, as the country has a vast size and variable climates. \\"Sky\\" does not make sense in the context of the bee's original location, as it's not a geographic place where bees live. China, though it is a country with diverse climates, does not specifically indicate a cold region. Lastly, \\"apiary\\" denotes a place where bees are kept but does not provide any information about the climate of the location. By considering these factors, \\"Michigan\\" emerges as an answer that aligns with human common sense because it represents a specific location known for its cold winters, falls within the ecological context of bees needing to escape the cold to survive, and is the most logical choice when compared to the other options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.

Given the fact \\"a mirror reflects light\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Mirrors reflect light because for light to travel through the material of which the mirror is made makes it\\" Available options:  * difficult;  * loud;  * easy;  * long;","output":"Mirrors reflect light because for light to travel through the material of which the mirror is made makes it difficult. The phenomenon of reflection can be explained in the context of the electromagnetic nature of light and the behavior of light waves when they interact with different materials. When light strikes the surface of an object, a significant proportion of the light waves encounter a boundary between two mediums with different optical properties (e.g., air and glass). At this boundary, the waves can either be transmitted through the material, absorbed by it, or reflected back into their original medium. Mirrors are specifically designed and manufactured to optimize the reflection process. The key to understanding why mirrors reflect light so effectively lies in the material properties and the structure of a mirror. The surface of a typical mirror comprises two main components: a thin layer of metallic coating (usually aluminum, silver, or gold) and a glass or plastic substrate that provides support for this coating. The metallic coating is responsible for the reflection of light. Metals possess unique characteristics on an atomic level. They have a high density of free electrons, that move about in a “sea” of negatively charged particles. When an incoming light wave strikes the metallic surface, the electric field component of the wave excites these free electrons and causes them to oscillate. As the electrons oscillate, they re-radiate light waves with the same frequency and phase as the original ones, effectively reflecting the light. On the other hand, if light were to travel through the material of a mirror, it would encounter many obstacles. Most metals used in mirrors are opaque and absorb a portion of the incident light, which makes the passage of light through the material difficult. Furthermore, the index of refraction of solid materials is generally higher than that of air, creating a mismatch at the interface that also discourages the transmission of light through the material. Moreover, practical mirrors utilize a protective layer of glass or plastic that covers the metallic coating. Although the substrate itself is transparent, its main role is to shield the reflective layer from physical damage and environmental factors that might degrade its reflective properties. The substrate does make some contribution to the overall reflection, mostly due to internal reflections within the glass or plastic from the multiple interfaces. In summary, mirrors reflect light because the metallic coating's properties facilitate the oscillation of free electrons, leading to the re-radiation of light waves and effectively creating reflected light. In contrast, light traveling through the material of a mirror would face several obstacles, including absorption and the mismatch in the index of refraction, making it difficult for light to pass through."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Martin Erat says it’s time for him and the Capitals to part ways. (Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post) Updated 1:53 p.m. Less than eight months after he was acquired by Washington, Martin Erat has asked the Capitals to trade him. “I want to be traded. We’ll see how it goes,” Erat said following Monday’s practice in Arlington. “Since day one, I didn’t get the chance here. I got traded here to be a top-six player but never got the chance, never played more than 15 minutes in here, and it’s time for me to move on.” Erat, 32, was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career Saturday night when the Capitals visited the Toronto Maple Leafs, but the veteran winger’s frustration with the way the team utilized him has been building. The Czech native initially approached General Manager George McPhee to request a trade in early October, while he was toiling away on the fourth line, and he reiterated it again last week. “It was long coming, starting from the training camp. I never get any chance, any look,” Erat said. “It’s time for me to go.” Erat has a full no-movement clause in his contract and would need to approve any trade, but McPhee said he doesn’t expect that to be a problem because the winger has been “flexible” and “accommodating” with what teams he would be willing to move to. McPhee said he has been talking to some teams and is working to find a trade. “We’ve always told our players, and our policy for 15 years or so, if you don’t feel like you fit in, if you feel like it’d be better for your career to be someplace else, let us know and we’ll try to accommodate you,” McPhee said. “I admire him for it. He’s been professional, he came in and he’s not pointing fingers or anything like that. He said, ‘These things happen and it’s not working out for me. I’d like an opportunity someplace else.’ No promises on when it happens. We’ll see how long it takes.” Washington acquired Erat along with fourth-line center Michael Latta from the Nashville Predators at the trade deadline last season in exchange for forward Filip Forsberg, a 2012 first-round draft pick who at the time was the second best prospect in the Capitals’ system. Erat had asked for a trade from the Predators when it became clear they were in rebuilding mode. At the time of the trade, McPhee was looking to add top-six forward depth with Brooks Laich out of the lineup because of a lingering groin injury. But Erat’s time in the top half of the lineup has been inconsistent, especially with Laich back in the mix this year. Coach Adam Oates has acknowledged multiple times that he’s struggled to determine where Erat best fits when all the forwards are healthy as well, bringing up questions as to whether it was a shortsighted move. “I’ve always believed that you’ve got to give your team the best chance you can give it going into the playoffs,” McPhee said. ”We were at the deadline, we missed Brooks a lot and didn’t know whether he’d be able to complete the season. We made a deal to help the team because you never know what year it’s going to be that your team advances and goes all the way. “You want to give your team the best opportunity possible, because you can’t have the guys work their guts out all year and then not help them out at the deadline if there’s something there to help them with. So we made that deal. No regrets. We did what we had to do then, and we’ll do what we have to do now.” In 13 games with the Capitals last year, including the regular season and playoffs, Erat skated more than 18 minutes twice and recorded only one goal and two assists. When this season began and Washington had a full complement of forwards, Erat played on the fourth line for the first seven games, saw the lowest ice time in his 11-year career and voiced his frustration with the role Oates gave him. Erat saw time on both the first and second line in the 16 other games he appeared in this season, with all of his six assists occurring when he was in the top half of the lineup, but he has played 17 minutes or more only twice all year. “It’s the way it goes, they just give me straight signal like I don’t fit here,” Erat said. “For me, time to go. It’s black and white. It’s time for me to go.” Said Erat’s agent, Michael Deutsch: “Marty had the highest of hopes when he was traded to Washington, it was high on his list. He really expected that it would work out based on the talent level of the players in the organization, but for whatever reason it hasn’t worked out. Marty apparently doesn’t fit in and he’d like to move on to a place where he’d be a better fit.” Erat’s current contract, which carries a 4.5 million cap hit, runs through the 2014-15 season but his salary is 3.75 million this season and 2.25 million the next. Although teams can retain salary of a player in order to facilitate a trade, McPhee said he would not consider keeping any of Erat’s salary in a move.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night. The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine.Internet users can read the full study,free of charge,at plos.org.

Specifically, individuals who sleep less than five hours a night have 15% higher blood levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, and 15% less of the hormone leptin, which promotes feelings of fullness.

Growing up on a farm near St. Paul, L. Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.\\".

I have a new situation: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.  But I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  What is an answer for this question: Which town emitted less carbon monoxide? The answer to this question is:","output":"Valley town emitted less carbon monoxide. The provided background information indicates that gasoline-powered vehicles emit various harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of a gasoline-powered car mitigates the harmful effects of these emissions by converting them into less harmful substances. However, the emissions are still present to some extent. Hill town is primarily dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles, contributing to carbon monoxide emissions. In contrast, Valley town has banned all gas-powered vehicles and only allows the use of electric vehicles and horse-and-buggies. Considering that electric vehicles do not produce any tailpipe emissions, including carbon monoxide, and horse-and-buggies produce no engine-based emissions, Valley town will have significantly lower levels of carbon monoxide. There may still be traces of carbon monoxide in Valley town due to various non-vehicle-related human activities and natural sources, but the overall concentration of the harmful gas will be significantly less than in Hill town, where gasoline-powered vehicles contribute significantly to the emissions. Additionally, electric vehicles' energy efficiency and reliance on clean energy sources further reduce carbon monoxide levels by indirectly decreasing the demand for non-renewable energy sources that could potentially generate carbon monoxide during energy production. In conclusion, Valley town, with its prohibition of gas-powered vehicles and encouragement of electric vehicles and horse-and-buggies, is substantially more effective in reducing carbon monoxide emissions compared to Hill town, where gasoline-powered vehicles with their inherent emission issues are prevalent."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Options: a ) 33 , b ) 87 , c ) 30 , d ) 88 , e ) 77 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the speeds of the train and the man into the same units. Since the length of the train is given in meters, we will convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s. Train speed: (63 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = 17.5 m/s Man speed: (3 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = 0.833 m/s Next, we find the relative speed of the train with respect to the man. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the man from the speed of the train: Relative speed = Train speed - Man speed = 17.5 m/s - 0.833 m/s = 16.67 m/s Now we can use the definition of speed, which is the distance traveled divided by the time taken: Speed = Distance / Time In this case, the distance that the train needs to travel is its entire length (500 meters) to completely cross the man. We can rearrange the speed equation to solve for the time taken: Time = Distance / Speed Substituting the values we have: Time = 500 meters / 16.67 m/s = 29.97 seconds Considering the available options, the closest answer is c) 30 seconds. So, the train takes approximately 30 seconds to cross the man.

The baton visited 23 nations and travelled over 63,000 miles (101,000km) before it reached the UK and was carried by 5,000 runners. As this year's relay for the Glasgow Games arrives in Manchester, four people who took part in 2002 reflect on what it meant to be a baton-bearer. The image of Kirsty Howard and footballer David Beckham handing the baton to the Queen at Manchester's opening ceremony is one of the most memorable moments in Commonwealth Games history. Kirsty was born in 1995 with her heart back to front. Aged four, she was told she had just weeks to live. She defied the odds and, breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank, she joined Beckham on the pitch for an England World Cup qualifier against Greece in 2001. Months later, pictures of the six-year-old and the Manchester United captain passing the baton to Her Majesty were beamed around the world. \\"I didn't know that David was going to be there,\\" she recalls. \\"I was just standing there waiting and he came round the corner. He just gave me a hug and we went towards the Queen. \\"The Queen smiled at me. \\"The reaction from friends and family was amazing.  I felt honoured to be there and everyone that I know was very proud. \\"It still feels an honour to have been part of it.\\" After achieving 12 GCSEs and raising about Â£7m for charity, Kirsty is now studying childcare at Manchester College with hopes of one day becoming a teacher. A Falklands War hero and charity fundraiser, Simon Weston is no stranger to public life. When he was asked to take part in the Queen's Baton Relay in 2002, he had no hesitation in saying yes as he \\"thought it would be fun\\". Weston ran in his native Wales and his memories of the event were as much about the attire as the relay itself. He said: \\"There was such a furore going on about the Manchester Games and I thought it would be lovely to take part in it. \\"You don't get to keep the baton. You have to hand it on to somebody else. It is not like the Olympics where everyone gets a torch if you want to buy it,\\" he added. \\"There were a lot of people who were slightly nervous. They had never done anything in the public eye before. \\"I was just treating it as a bit of fun, which it was. It was a good laugh,\\" he said. \\"The weirdest thing about it was the fact that I had to turn up wearing the most hideous tracksuit. It looked like I had been sitting next to an explosion in a paint factory. It provided my family and friends with great mirth.\\" Many people who took part in the 2002 relay were supported by the communities in which they lived. Elizabeth Heathcote was chosen by the Woman's Institute (WI) in Rutland after successfully recovering from a stroke 18 months earlier. Now 67, she reflected: \\"We were supported by lots of WIs. They decided it was nice that I had fully recovered and they asked me if I would represent them. \\"It was a great honour and over so quickly.\\" Elizabeth also has memories of the uniform worn by the baton-bearers. \\"It was a very bright outfit. They could see us all coming,\\" she joked. \\"It was something very different, something that I will probably never do again. I have done a few things in the WI but I think that was one of the highlights. \\"It is all part of life's sweet tapestry.\\" Claire Hewitt, who in 2002 was a 30-year-old living in the Tooting, south London, was nominated in secret by her neighbour Ian Fenn. \\"I got a parcel through the post. It said: 'Congratulations, you are going to be a baton relay runner. Here is your outfit.' \\"I had no idea what was going on at all.\\" Claire was put forward for welcoming Ian to the area. She now lives with her family in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and co-owns a software development company. Claire, like other runners, ran 500 yards (457m) with the 2002 baton. One of the distinctive features of that baton was an LED sensor that detected the pulse of the person who held it. She added: \\"I am not one of life's sporty people. I remember thinking: 'God, can I even run that far.' \\"I went out for a little test-run in a park in Windsor to check I could.  It had a light inside that kept pulse with your heartbeat. \\"It is obviously quite exciting and a bit surreal. I am sure there are people who are far worthier than me. It was one of life's experiences - one to tell the grandchildren about. \\"I have kids now, and I think they would be interested to see my uniform in the loft.\\" The Queen's Baton Relay has been the traditional curtain-raiser for the Commonwealth Games since 1958. Every baton is different, and this year's relay began last October in London. It has travelled around the Commonwealth and has been held by thousands of children and athletes who will compete in Glasgow later this summer. Since the baton arrived back on the British Isles earlier this month in the hands of Olympic medallist Tom Daley, it has toured the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Wales. It will travel around England from Saturday until 13 June before it spends 40 days in Scotland. Just like it did in 2002, it will then play a key role in the opening ceremony of the Games. The BBC will be across the relay with rolling live video online every day when the baton is in Scotland. Summary:","output":"In 2002, there was a special event called the Jubilee Relay before the Manchester Games. A baton traveled through 23 countries and was carried by 5,000 runners before it arrived in the UK. One memorable moment was when a little girl named Kirsty Howard and the famous football player David Beckham handed the baton to the Queen. The Queen's Baton Relay has been a tradition since 1958, and it happens before the Commonwealth Games. The baton has a special light inside that matches the heartbeat of the person holding it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Translate \\"Various sources – 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" to Romanian?","output":"Translation of \\"Various sources – 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" to Romanian would be \\"Diverse surse – 16/02/07-23/02/07\\".  Let's break it down: 1. \\"Various\\" translates to \\"Diverse\\" in Romanian language. The word \\"diverse\\" refers to a variety or wide range of things or items that somehow are related or belong to a specific category. 2. The word \\"sources\\" translates as \\"surse\\". \\"Surse\\" refers to the origin of something received or obtained. It could indicate the starting point of a story, information, or resource. Therefore, \\"diverse surse\\" together refers to a wide variety of origins of certain information or data. 3. The dates \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" remains the same. In Romanian, just like in many other languages, the dates are represented the same way with the day, month, and year format. So, \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" would still be \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" in Romanian. Therefore, the full sentence \\"Various sources – 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" translates to \\"Diverse surse – 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" in Romanian. Please note that punctuation usage, like the dash (-) used here, remains standard across many languages, including Romanian.  Please, bear in mind that if you want this phrase to perfectly fit the particular context, especially in a formal, academic, or professional document, it is advisable to seek advice from a professional translator or native speaker as some meanings in translations can be lost or different based on various factors like locality, culture or even modern language slang and nuances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - shell  - proton  - electrons  - nuclei  A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understanding the question The question asks us to identify what distinguishes radioactive isotopes, and provides 4 choices: shell, proton, electrons, and nuclei. Step 2: Analyzing the choices - Shell: Refers to the arrangement of electrons around an atom's nucleus. Stable or unstable shells are related to electronic arrangement only. - Proton: Positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons defines the element. - Electrons: Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in distinct shells. Electron stability can affect chemical properties and reactivity but not radioactivity. - Nuclei: The central core of an atom, composed of protons and neutrons. The stability of the nucleus determines whether an atom is radioactive or not. Step 3: Selecting the correct choice Among the choices provided, it is the \\"nuclei\\" that determines whether an isotope is radioactive or not.

Here is a premise: Placing the entire future of a corporation in the hands of arbitrageurs, which is what a tender offer amounts to, is the worship of property rights run amok. Here is a hypothesis: Arbitrageurs have very little say in the future of companies. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the conclusion can be drawn from the premise, we need to analyze the premise and the hypothesis step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that putting the future of a company in the hands of arbitrageurs (through a tender offer) is an extreme case of prioritizing property rights. In other words, the premise suggests that relying on arbitrageurs to determine the future of a corporation is a negative action, as it excessively values property rights. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that arbitrageurs have little influence on the future of companies. This means that, according to the hypothesis, the actions and decisions made by arbitrageurs do not significantly impact the trajectory and growth of corporations. Step 3: Assess the connection between the premise and the hypothesis Now, we must determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. We do this by examining the logical connection between the two statements. Based on the premise, it is implied that arbitrageurs have significant control over the future of a corporation, as tender offers are a way of giving control to arbitrageurs. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that arbitrageurs have very little say in the future of companies. Step 4: Evaluate the compatibility of the premise and the hypothesis The premise and the hypothesis are contradictory because the premise implies that arbitrageurs have significant control over the future of a corporation when a tender offer is involved, while the hypothesis argues that arbitrageurs have limited influence on companies. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true, as the two statements are incompatible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How do you make drinks cold quickly?","output":"Making drinks cold quickly can be achieved through several methods, each with varying levels of efficiency. Here is a step-by-step guide to some of the most effective techniques: 1. Ice and Salt Water Bath (Fastest method):    a. Fill a large bowl, bucket, or cooler with ice cubes or crushed ice.    b. Add cold water to the container, making sure it covers about half of the ice.    c. Mix in a generous amount of salt (preferably rock or kosher salt) to the ice-water mixture. The salt reduces the freezing point of water, allowing the solution to become colder than regular ice water.    d. Submerge your drink in the saltwater bath, ensuring that it is fully surrounded by the ice.    e. Gently stir your drink in the ice bath or swirl the ice around it to maximize contact with the cold mixture.    f. Leave the drink in the ice bath for at least 3-5 minutes for cans or small bottles, and 7-10 minutes for larger bottles, checking frequently until the desired temperature is reached. 2. Wet Paper Towel Method:    a. Dampen a sheet of paper towel with cold water, ensuring that it is saturated but not dripping.    b. Wrap the wet paper towel around your drink, entirely covering its surface.    c. Place the wrapped drink in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the container and the desired temperature. Check regularly to prevent freezing.    d. Remove your drink from the freezer once it has reached the appropriate coldness. 3. Spin and Chill (with caution):    a. Place your drink in the freezer and set a timer for 1-2 minutes. This will help bring down its temperature slightly.    b. Remove your drink from the freezer and partially submerge it in an ice bucket or bowl filled with ice.    c. Carefully spin your drink along its horizontal axis for 30-60 seconds. The spinning motion helps to cool down the drink more evenly and quickly by convection.    d. Be cautious with carbonated drinks, as spinning them may cause pressure buildup. In this case, you can try gently rotating the containers in the ice.    e. Check the temperature of your drink and repeat the spinning process if necessary until it reaches the desired coldness. 4. Using a Blast Chiller or Instant Beverage Chiller (Requires specialized equipment):    a. Obtain a blast chiller or instant beverage chiller, which are designed to cool drinks quickly.    b. Place your drink in the designated area of the appliance according to the manufacturer's instructions.    c. Set the timer as specified by the device's user manual (usually 2-10 minutes, depending on the appliance and drink size).    d. Wait for the appliance to cool your drink to the desired temperature. Regardless of the method you choose, always remember that regular monitoring and gentle handling are crucial to ensure the desired results and avoid over-freezing or pressurization.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the nickname of the person that gives the firing notice to the man who can't find his favorite mug?  Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off. Derek's friend Ewan is unable to help him, and he is given official notice of his firing by his coworker \\"The Reaper\\".

The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long. Text: some people in an askreddit thread wanted the full story of this, so here it is. as with most tifus this didn't happen today but instead, about 2-3yrs ago. some background first: so, i'm 17 at the time, larger build, about 6' and 200lbs, that's about 90kg for you non-americans, in high school in a small small town of about 7k people, really really unpopular, like, the most unpopular one, people liked to pick on me, i liked to hit people who picked on me. the principal was always cool, he was on my side ninety percent of the time, i was never able to get out of punishment that way, but hey, reduced sentence is fine with me. senior year, that changed, welcome to the new principal, who hates my guts. so, the entire year, i've got to deal with this harpy of a principal that will crucify me for the slightest transgression, i do my best to annoy her, she does her best to slap me with the best punishment she can. a sort of hate/hate relationship. i carry around my 1.7 gpa, avoid most homework, and generally not give a fuck.  well, one day, i'm waiting with some friends (and people who are alright with me, but don't necessarily like me) before school in a park right next to the school, smoking cigarettes before class starts, and this cute girl (henceforth known as cutie) that i know comes up to me, and asks if i would protest with her in the school, i figure \\"sure, what the fuck, i'll 'stick it to the man' and protest with her\\" and i'm thinking there's a pretty fantastic chance of getting laid if this goes down right.  she hands me a sign to hold and a mask to wear, i put it on, school starts, we wait a couple minutes, and then enter the school, she starts shouting something about something, honestly, i don't even remember because right about that time i'm thinking maybe this wasn't such a good idea. this continues for about five minutes until we are about halfway down a hallway when the schools resource officer calls out to us. he's a pretty chill dude, and friends with all the students, including me. he tells us it's time to stop the protest, and come to the office. me and the cutie back up, hesitant to go with him. he approaches, as officers do. cutie and i are both figuring out if it's better to give up, or book it when he gets within about five feet of us. officer asks me to give him the sign, i refuse, to this day i'm not a hundred percent why, and in response, he grabs me, shoves me into a corner between the lockers and the hallways wall. my whole fight/flight response is roaring and ready to take me the fuck out of there. i resist, full of adrenaline, nicotine, and monster, trying to get out of the corner. now, only two things were in my head at that moment: this dude is attacking me i need to get the hell out of dodge i try to slip past him,he grabs me, i fall, he comes with me. cutie is just standing there, watching all of this go down. i try to clamber to my feet, but mr. officer isn't letting go, he's got my leg with his vice grip hands and won't let go. he climbs up on top of me trying to restrain me, i quite literally (to the amazement of several military recruiters) do a push-up with this cop on my big, and mind you, he's got about 40lbs on me. now, at this point, two neurons just connected inside of cuties brain, and she decides it's all gone too far, she tells me to give up, and now two neurons connect in my brain and i realize that at this point, i should just give up, like she says, because there's no way that me escaping is going to make things better. i flatten out on the ground, and place my hands in a position behind my back to make it easier for him to cuff me, because i just know after that fiasco this dude wants to put cuffs on me. so, officer cuffs me, and i'm laying here while he radios for suv with a cell in it to meet him out front. about this time, i look up and see harpy mcharpyface walking down the hall towards us with the biggest shit-eating grin i've ever seen. she just got her ammunition to boot me out. i lock eyes with her and the only thing that comes out of my mouth is \\"wow, you're a total bitch from this angle too!\\" because, well, why not? i get walked to the front by the officer, all the while apologizing to him, because he's my friend, and i know he didn't really want to do that. after about five minutes of standing around in the worlds most uncomfortable handcuffs the suv arrives. i'm forced into it. having your hands cuffed too tight behind your back is seriously uncomfortable, but being forced to sit in a cramped seat with your hands cuffed behind your back is even worse. we arrive at the police station in only a few minutes, because it's just a few blocks away. i am ushered through reception, uncuffed, and thrown in a small holding cell with a single yellow chair. that yellow chair wasn't comfortable, nothing about being arrested is comfortable, don't do it. i sit there for two hours. eventually, the door opens, i'm recuffed, and taken to a police cruiser. cue more sitting in a car in the most uncomfortable position. we arrive at the juvenile detention facility in the bigger city nearby, and i am  left in their care, uncuffed. i am handed a set of clothing, and a tiny bit of soap before being ushered into a small shower room. here, i get to experience my first ever strip search, how fun! i strip down, show the dude i'm not hiding anything in my butt, and he leaves me to shower and get dressed, which i do quickly. i get led to a cell where i will wait in my brand new orange outfit until the courthouse is ready to talk to me. i sit there for another two hours, get the worst sammich i've ever had courtesy of the county, and am escorted out in, i shit you not, leg shackles, handcuffs, in front this time, and a stomach restraint, to which my cuffs are attached. i get driven to the courthouse by a random officer, and we take the elevator up to the correct floor. we proceed down a hallway, to come into the courtroom from the far side near the judge, but to get there we have to pass the entrance to the front of the courtroom, where my gram-gram just happens to be sitting with my brother's adorable daughter, who asks simply, in the most adorable way possible \\"why is thepewpew1337\\" in handcuffs. i enter the courtroom, am made to sit, and cue twenty minutes of everyone talking about what to do with me. they decide i should be released to my mother, so i'm taken back to juvenile hall for out-processing after signing my name on some papers, which really isn't that easy to do when your hands are cuffed to your stomach. i get my clothes and belongings back at juvie, and am made to wait at reception until my mother arrives. she arrives, waiting by her car while the receptionist talks to me. i walk out, and all she says is \\"i'm so fucking proud of you right now\\". this takes me completely off guard, because while my mom is a weirdo, and a bit of a hippy, i was sure she'd murder me for this. well, apparently she was really proud of me deciding to protest something i didn't like, i didn't ever tell her i was just looking to get laid, and we go home. it was decided i'd do 12 hours of community service, which i ended up doing. the fun part is that the principal was ready to expel me, but my mom had to go have a talk with her. there's a reason i don't mess with my mom, and this is one of several reasons why: she went in there, and the principal and vice principal were tearing into her about how i'm a terrible person and am a danger to the school, and should be expelled. my mom didn't like this, fired off some hot angry words, and somewhere along the line mentioned that a certain pocket on her purse, which she motioned to, was her gun pouch. i ended up getting 2 weeks of vacation out of school, with my grades not being affected, and no homework pile-up when i got back. me and cutie never got to screw, pretty sure she really didn't want to have anything to do with me, because while all of my in-processing and out-processing was going on, the school district was put into lockdown because apparently two kids had spread a rumor successfully through that school that i had a gun and was planning on shooting people. that part spread through the town, and made it extremely hard to get a job, because everyone now thinks i'm a domestic terrorist. the two weeks of vacation concluded, and i returned to school. turns out that the rumor ended up making me the single most feared kid at my school, because no one wanted to pick on me, hit me, or mess with me in any form after that. my grades also improved to 3.5 gpa before i graduated. turns out too that a girl who ended up becoming my girlfriend had watched the whole thing go down from down the hallway. but this isn't a love story, she was a cunt. ended up later getting a real fun job at a sporting goods warehouse in the bigger city though (got to pack guns and ammo and fun stuff like that), because being known as \\"that terrorist kid\\" makes it difficult to get a job. prior to the entire incident, i had aspirations of joining the military, probably the usmc, but having four misdemeanors on your fbi record makes that much harder, especially when one of those is assault on a police officer. (which i never did, dude just lied about me hitting him, what a dill-pickle)   moral of the story: uh.....don't get arrested, and doing work to get laid is only worth it up to a point, especially when you never actually get any. sorry for this post being so long, but i wanted to convey accurately all the details. edit: (´･ω･\`)","output":"Summary: A student joins a protest with a girl he was attracted to at school, hoping it would lead to a romantic connection.

Help as much as you can. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Phagocytosis is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 3.26). A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (Figure 3.26). A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain substances (Figure 3.26). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of receptor-mediated endocytosis is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptormediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.

This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil.

The request comes after a series of victims have come forward, accusing multiple professionals in the field of engaging in inappropriate behavior ranging from unwanted advances to outright assault.  In response to these claims, Lowry has been outspoken in his belief that a thorough, independent investigation must be conducted to not only address the specific allegations made, but also to scrutinize the overall culture and power dynamics that allow for such behavior to persist. By insisting on an external inquiry rather than an internal review, Lowry hopes to maintain the transparency and impartiality of the investigation. Lowry's call for an independent probe is significant as it highlights the need to take these allegations seriously, without being influenced by internal biases that can often sway the outcome of in-house inquiries. By emphasizing the importance of an external agency or panel of experts to thoroughly review the claims, Lowry demonstrates his commitment to establishing a fair and inclusive work environment for everyone involved in the industry. Furthermore, Lowry's vocal stance on the issue sends a powerful message to others in similar positions of authority, encouraging them to recognize the significance of such allegations and the need to actively address them. By making his intentions clear, Lowry aims to deter the continuation of abusive behavior while motivating organizations to foster a safe space that is free from harassment and discrimination. In addition to calling for an independent probe, Lowry has also expressed his support for the victims who bravely came forward to share their experiences. Recognizing the courage it takes to speak out against abuse, Lowry has praised their strength and conviction, promising to stand by them throughout the process and beyond. As the investigation is set to commence, it is essential that all parties remain committed to maintaining transparency and impartiality in order to achieve a just outcome.

'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

The given equation is -23 * o + 15 * o = 19 * o - 810. Step 1: Combine the \\"o\\" terms on the left side of the equation. -23 * o + 15 * o = -8 * o Now the equation becomes -8 * o = 19 * o - 810. Step 2: Move the \\"-8 * o\\" term to the right side of the equation by adding \\"8 * o\\" to both sides of the equation. -8 * o + 8 * o = 19 * o - 810 + 8 * o This simplifies to: 0 = 27 * o - 810 Step 3: Now we want to isolate \\"o\\" by moving the constant term, i.e., -810, to the left side. We can do this by adding 810 to both sides: 0 + 810 = 27 * o - 810 + 810 This simplifies to: 810 = 27 * o Step 4: Now, we want to solve for \\"o\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 27: 810 / 27 = 27 * o / 27 This simplifies to: 30 = o So the solution for the given equation is: o = 30"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot. Why was the Greater London Council established? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The Greater London Council (GLC) was established primarily to address the rapid growth of the urban area and better manage the diverse needs of the sprawling metropolis. Prior to the establishment of the GLC in 1965, London's political boundaries did not accurately represent the extent of its urban growth which had occurred during the post-World War II era. This presented significant challenges in terms of administration, planning, and the provision of public services and infrastructure. The GLC was created as an overarching authority, combining the administrative powers of the earlier London County Council and the surrounding counties of Essex, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, and Hertfordshire. This larger governing body allowed for a more cohesive approach to the management of London's growth, as well as enabling the coordination of regional planning, transportation, housing, and environmental policies, among others. The GLC was responsible for various aspects of governance, such as public transport and the management of major roads, policing, fire services, waste disposal, and flood prevention. It also played an important role in the promotion of arts and culture. Through better-equipped governance, the council was designed to streamline decision-making and begin to address issues arising from the city's drastic expansion. In summary, the establishment of the Greater London Council aimed to accurately account for the city's growing urban area and to facilitate a more efficient and effective system of governance in response to the increasing complexities of managing London's expanding population and infrastructure needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Verni and lead vocalist Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth as the only constant members. In addition to Verni and Ellsworth, Overkill's current lineup includes Dave Linsk on lead guitar, Derek Tailer on rhythm guitar and Jason Bittner on drums. After taking a break, Overkill resurfaced in 2002 with Wrecking Everything, their second full-length live album, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The album contained only songs that had not been on Wrecking Your Neck, some simply because they were released on later albums, but also a few early songs from albums such as Taking Over and Under the Influence. The same show was used for Overkill's first ever DVD, Wrecking Everything - An Evening in Asbury Park, also released in 2002.  The European tour in June 2002, supporting both Bloodletting and Wrecking Everything saw Blaze and Wicked Mystic opening up for Overkill. During the second to last show of the tour in Nuremberg, Germany, Blitz suffered a stroke on stage and collapsed. For nearly three days, rumors ran rampant, reporting everything from Blitz being in a coma, permanently paralyzed, or even that Blitz had died. Finally, three days later, the band announced that the stroke was very minor and had no lasting consequences, as well as no cause that could be determined by the doctors.  Overkill signed to Spitfire Records and entered the studio in late 2002 to record their next studio album, Killbox 13. Produced by the band and Colin Richardson and released in March 2003, the album was actually only their twelfth regular studio album, but the Overkill EP was also counted to achieve the number 13. The album received critical acclaim, combining the \\"new\\" Overkill with their raw early style as presented on the debut album Feel the Fire. Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with Seven Witches and After All. The band played without Derek Tailer, who was absent for undisclosed reasons. Nobody was hired to fill in for him, so Overkill toured as a four-piece for the first time since 1990. Tailer was still considered a full member of the band.  In late 2004, after a Japanese tour with Death Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam, the band started work on another record in D. D. Verni's own recording studio. The album, ReliXIV, was produced and mixed by the band themselves and released in March 2005.  Overkill toured the eastern US in April 2005, and just before they went on a European tour in May, it was announced that Tim Mallare would not take part in this tour.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"?

A more detailed explanation: When using a more accurate precontained filter, the filtration process might become more efficient, and it could potentially lead to a better extraction of coffee flavors. However, filling more coffee in the filter than 2/3 full could influence the brewing process as well. If there's too much coffee in the filter, this could lead to an uneven extraction, and the final brewed coffee might turn out to be either too strong or not strong enough. Considering both the changes, the perturbation will indirectly impact a step of the process, specifically, the extraction of coffee flavors that happens when hot water passes through the ground coffee in the filter. Although none of the steps in the process are directly altered by using a more accurate precontained filter and filling more coffee than 2/3 full, the result of these changes might affect how well the coffee tastes in the end.

Step 1: Look for the numbers with the same letters (in this case, \\"f\\"). We have 1468*f and -1447*f.

Step 3: We want to find the value of \\"f\\" that makes the equation true. To do this, we will add 252 to both sides of the equation: 21*f - 252 + 252 = 0 + 252, which simplifies to 21*f = 252. Step 4: To find the value of \\"f,\\" we need to divide both sides of the equation by 21: 21*f / 21 = 252 / 21, which simplifies to f = 12. So the answer is f = 12.

This is in line with the term \\"bipartisan,\\" which implies cooperation and compromise between different political parties. Hypothesis: All members of the board are Republican. This hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it claims that the entire board is composed of members from a single political party (the Republican party). If all members were Republican, this would mean there are more than six members from one political party, directly violating the premise's condition. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise sets a clear limit on the number of members from any one political party, while the hypothesis proposes a scenario in which this limit is not respected. As such, the answer is [III] no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.
