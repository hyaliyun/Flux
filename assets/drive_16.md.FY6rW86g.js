Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Which fruit had a longer shelf life because of better preservation, apples or peaches? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","output":"Sugaring is a food preservation method that offers an effective way to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by dehydrating them and packing them with pure sugar. However, the efficiency of the sugaring process can be influenced by factors such as the composition of the fruit and environmental conditions. In the case of Dan and Joey, we're comparing the shelf life of candied apples and peaches. Both fruits are good candidates for sugar preservation; however, there are some differences between apples and peaches that may impact the shelf life of the preserved fruit. Apples naturally have low water content and high acidity, which makes them less prone to bacterial growth. Their firmer texture allows for more efficient dehydration, making them better suited for the sugaring process. Moreover, apples contain higher amounts of pectin, a natural carbohydrate that can help promote gelling and provide additional dietary fiber, which can aid in the preservation process. Peaches, on the other hand, have higher water content and a softer texture, making them prone to quicker spoilage under improper conditions. Additionally, high humidity levels in the environment where Joey preserved his peaches may have negatively impacted the preservation process by attracting moisture to the sugar, causing fermentation and reducing the shelf life of the candied peaches. Considering the characteristics of both fruits, the better preservation conditions prepared by Dan, as well as the natural properties that make apples more resistant to microbial growth, it can be inferred that the candied apples had a longer shelf life compared to the candied peaches. The high humidity experienced by Joey during his preservation process likely led to the compromised preservation of his peaches, reducing their shelf life compared to the apples preserved by Dan."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Such is the case with the stunningly awful \\"Blundering Beyond.\\" This film is nothing less than a wonder in its capacity to repulse, an ode to poor craftsmanship. As a consummate professional, I try to maintain an open mind and approach every film, hoping to find at least one redeeming quality. Yet, for \\"Blundering Beyond,\\" I am disappointed to say that my search was futile. From the onset, the film's plot is so hastily sewn together that it barely makes any sense. It meanders through a maze of underdeveloped subplots, never quite settling long enough to allow the audience to grow interested in any of them. Honestly, it seems as though the scriptwriter penned the gobbledygook whilst battling a persistent case of amnesia, continually forgetting where they were in the story, and haphazardly cramming in contrived twists and turns to piece arcane fragments together. The dialogue blindly stumbles through clichés and tired, overused tropes, with a plethora of cringe-worthy attempts to mimic pop culture references ironically dating the film rather than making it relevant. This dismal script does no favors for an already hopeless cast as they try to breathe life into their one-dimensional characters. The acting, if one can call it that, is woefully inadequate, reminiscent of a poorly rehearsed high school theater production. Each performance is either ludicrously over-the-top or lifeless, with actors seemingly unable to escape the gravitational pull of mediocrity. It's evident that the director failed to communicate their artistic vision, allowing the lead actors to clash in style, resulting in a cacophony of painful performances devoid of any semblance of chemistry. The soundtrack is a confusing, disjointed mess that only adds to the perplexity of the film. The mixing is nothing short of amateurish, with unsuitable choices of songs that not only overshadow the on-screen action but also induce auditory whiplash. It's as if the music supervisor took three random CDs from a dusty bargain bin and used the selections indiscriminately, without a whisper of thought for tone or ambiance. As for the cinematography, it is mind-boggling how it alternates between nausea-inducing shaky cam and seemingly random pans and zooms. Scenes feel like they have been plucked from dubious YouTube video tutorials on how to wield a camera. Adding insult to injury, the editing is choppy and jarring, rendering entire sequences incomprehensible as the viewer can do little more than squint in a futile attempt to make some sense of the chaos unfolding before their eyes. Visual effects, for the most part, are virtually non-existent. However, the few times they are employed, they scream of budget deficits and an uncreative reliance on outdated technology. It's genuinely astounding how the visual effects here manage to be both minimalistic and garish, leaving the eyes assaulted and begging for respite. In conclusion, \\"Blundering Beyond\\" is a testament to film-making gone horribly awry. It's a painful and mind-numbing experience, leaving the viewer with a dizzying sense of disconnectedness from reality. Avoiding this film is not only a recommendation but an appeal for the preservation of one's sanity and any remaining faith in the sacred art of cinema."},{"instruction":"Translate to Czech: Great.","output":"Skvělé.

The town's economy mainly relies on fishing activities and seafood products, and many families' livelihoods depend on the fishing industry. As a result, the reduction in fish population has dramatically affected the town's prosperity, leaving many people without sufficient income to support themselves and their families. Several factors could potentially contribute to the decreasing fish population, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, and human intervention in the natural habitats of marine life. The town has a local government and environmental group trying to find ways to address the issue and restore the once-thriving aquatic ecosystem along the coastline, which would benefit both the marine life and the community. Hypothesis: The primary cause of the declining fish population in the sea near the coastal town is a combination of overfishing and pollution from local industries, which have led to the degradation of marine habitats and the subsequent reduction in the number of fish species available for fishermen to catch. To test this hypothesis, the local government and environmental group could implement several research and conservation measures, such as: 1. Monitoring the fishing activities of local fishermen to ensure sustainable fishing practices are followed and quotas are respected. 2. Implementing strict regulations on the local industries to reduce pollution discharge into the sea. 3. Monitoring water quality and pollution levels along the coastline to track changes in the ecosystem and collect valuable data on the health of the marine environment. 4. Conducting regular biodiversity assessments to identify changes in species populations and the presence of invasive species, which could further damage the marine ecosystem. 5. Collaborating with neighboring coastal towns and international organizations to promote a joint effort in conserving and restoring marine habitats in the broader geographical region. By addressing the primary hypothesized causes (overfishing and pollution) and implementing a comprehensive conservation plan, it is expected that the marine ecosystem will gradually recover, allowing the fish population to increase and eventually leading to better fishing opportunities for the local community, ultimately improving the town's economy."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Epidemiologic studies suggest that ovarian hormones contribute to the development of breast cancer at all stages. Early menopause and premenopausal obesity reduces the risk while postmenopausal obesity and menopausal estrogen replacement therapy increases the risk. Combined oral contraceptives and Depo-Provera do not reduce the risk. It appears that estrogens and progestogens act through and with proto-oncogenes and growth factors to affect breast cell proliferation and breast cancer etiology. Animal studies suggest that estrogen causes interlobular ductal cell division and progesterone causes increased terminal duct lobular unit cell division in the luteal phase. Most breast carcinomas originate from terminal duct lobular unit cells. During pregnancy, these cells fully multiply. Their reproduction is also increased during the luteal phase. Yet, there is considerable interpersonal variation. No studies examining breast cell division have compared cell division rates with serum hormone concentrations, however. The peak of mitosis occurs about 3 days before breast cell death in the late luteal and very early follicular phases. Other research suggests that breast stem cell proliferation is linked to breast cancer development. Endocrine therapy reduces mitotic activity, indicating the estrogen and progesterone receptor content of breast cancers. Hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines are all estrogen-dependent.

It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it.

Now, over ten years later, they're using their flip flop business to help other orphans. The boys had an unusual childhood. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India. Their parents were of the philosophy that they would receive a healthier and fuller education by traveling the world and helping others. There they did lots of voluntary work and mixed with the local community. It was when the family were on holiday in Sri Lanka that the tsunami hit. Although the children managed to escape, their parents tragically couldn't. But Paul says their upbringing meant they were able to cope with this tough blow. \\"Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve,\\" says Paul. What the boys did was to start a business selling ethically-sourced sandals. They're called 'Gandys' after the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi. \\"He was in all our schoolbooks as kids; he's on all the money over in India; he's famous for wearing his flip flops,\\" says Paul. The entire project was inspired by their parents' philosophy, their globetrotting childhoods and what happened to them in Sri Lanka. Their parents had previously worked in the fashion industry before quitting their jobs and focusing on humanitarian projects. Thus, Gandys is a very fitting tribute to their lives. Gandys sells flip-flops and donates 10 percent of the profits from every pair sold to orphans around the globe. In conjunction with Gandys, the Forkans also founded Orphans for Orphans, a charitable organization dedicated to helping orphans. They say they can make a profit and do good at the same time: they give 10% of their profit to charity, and have set up their own foundation through which they've been able to open a children's home in Sri Lanka.

They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist retired corrections officer whose wife committed suicide. Hank is a deputy warden. He oversees the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a \\"Monster's Ball\\" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too intense for Sonny, who begins to vomit and then collapses as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair. Hank confronts Sonny in the jail's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so \\"soft\\" and ruining a man's last walk. At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and tells him to get out of the house. Sonny grabs a gun, and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him.

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Translate to English English:","output":"Regarding the situation in Malaysia, I would like to say first and foremost that we are very concerned about the attacks on churches in a country known for being tolerant and moderate. In relation to the situation in Malaysia, our primary concern is the ongoing attacks on churches that have been occurring. Malaysia, as a country, has historically been considered a place of tolerance and moderation. These recent incidents have led to growing unease regarding the safety and security of religious establishments, fostering an overall atmosphere of apprehension. It is crucial to examine the underlying causes that have contributed to this concerning phenomenon. Several factors might have contributed to these attacks, including religious intolerance, political issues, and a general rise in global extremism. It is essential to address these possible concerns in order to find a solution and prevent further conflict. In Malaysia, one issue that may have caused tension is the country's multireligious and multicultural nature. While most of the population is Muslim, significant minority populations of Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus also coexist. This diversity has historically been a source of strength for Malaysia, but it can also lead to conflicts or misunderstandings between different religious or ethnic groups. Political issues might have also contributed to the rise in attacks on churches. In some cases, politicians in Malaysia have used religion as a tool to gain support from particular religious groups, which could exacerbate religious tensions. Additionally, external influences, such as extremist ideologies from other countries, might have seeped into Malaysia and contributed to the radicalization of certain individuals or groups. To address these issues and help mitigate further conflict, there are several steps that must be taken. First, there must be a greater emphasis on promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue between different religious communities. This can involve organizing events that bring together members of different faiths to discuss common values and promote understanding and mutual respect. Secondly, it is crucial that there is a focus on effective law enforcement and protection of religious establishments. Ensuring that perpetrators of religious violence are brought to justice will not only help protect places of worship but also send a strong message that such criminal acts will not be tolerated. Finally, there must be an emphasis on education and awareness about the importance of religious freedom and tolerance. Schools, religious institutions, and community organizations should work together to create and promote educational programs that celebrate Malaysia's religious diversity and promote understanding among all citizens. In conclusion, the situation in Malaysia regarding the attacks on churches is a cause for concern, but it is crucial to examine the potential underlying issues that have led to these events in order to effectively address them. By fostering a sense of tolerance and understanding and ensuring the protection of religious establishments, we can work towards a safer and more harmonious society in Malaysia."},{"instruction":"Noch weniger verstehen können wir allerdings, daß das Thema der Institutionen so beiläufig abgehandelt wird: im Text ist fast keine Rede davon, es heißt lediglich, dies würde später kommen.

This task would require participants to apply their understanding of physical concepts like balance, weight distribution, and structural integrity. Step-by-step justification: 1. **Defining the task**: In order to test a person's physical reasoning, we need a task that presents a problem that involves spatial thinking and understanding physical principles. Building a tower with given objects combines these elements. 2. **Selecting the objects**: Objects like LEGO bricks, wooden blocks, or books are appropriate for this task. They are commonly available, have a consistent size, and their shape and weight make them suitable for constructing unique structures. 3. **Setting constraints**: Placing constraints in the task, like using a limited number of blocks or specifying a minimum height for the tower, will force participants to consider structural stability, balance, and weight distribution to achieve the goal. 4. **Stability requirement**: The aim of the task is to build a stable tower that stands by itself without collapsing. This will encourage participants to think about the physical concepts involved (e.g., center of mass, base support) and ensure that their design remains grounded in physical realities. 5. **Observing and measuring success**: To evaluate the participants' performance, their constructed tower must be observed for a certain amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds or 1 minute). The success can be measured by comparing the height of the constructed tower, compliance with given constraints, and its stability over time. 6. **Assessing reasoning**: Through this task, participants can demonstrate their ability to think critically about physical and spatial concepts, as well as apply their understanding of balance and weight distribution to create a stable structure. Analyzing the final tower design will provide insights into their physical reasoning abilities."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Aliki Mouriki, a professor of sociology at the University of Athens, said buyers know Greece is desperate and may be waiting to cash in on fire sales.\\" to Turkish?","output":"Aliki Mouriki, Atina Üniversitesi'nde sosyoloji profesörüdür.

The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest.

Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement.

In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What does glass lack, allowing it to be polycrystalline?","output":"Glass is a special material that we can see through. Unlike polycrystalline materials, glass doesn't have lots of tiny crystal pieces with faces that bounce light around.

Odds are, you won't strike a film about chess. Chess isn't generally considered a stadium filler (although it can be). It's perceived as a game for eccentric intellectuals and elderly historians. It doesn't have the glamour or sex appeal of more sedentary sports, such as pool, as demonstrated by Paul Newman in The Hustler. Chess won't even fit snugly in to other genre films, where the banality of cards, for example, naturally lends itself to a seedy, gambling gangster underworld (Rounders), the exotic highlife of a casino (Casino Royale), or even more piquant, a combo of the two (Ocean's Eleven). But chess? It's just too uncool, and Computer Chess only serves to compound that. In cinemas this week, Computer Chess is the latest feature from mumblecore pioneer, director Andrew Bujalski, his first since Beeswax, in 2009. It's a fly on the wall, almost mockumentary-style dry comedy, following a computer chess tournament as it unfolds over a weekend. It could have been a proud starring role for the game, a film for the Magnus Carlsen era (the young prodigy and new World Champion described as the Harry Potter of the sport). Alas, neither the game nor the players are shown in a particularly endearing light. Sadly, this seems to be the fate of chess throughout the course of cinema. Reading on mobile?

On the seldom occasions it makes an appearance, it is usually merely a prop to emphasise intellect or cunning, or as a material analogy to illustrate a scheming mind. Take the classic example of Blade Runner, in which a battle of wits between Roy Batty and Dr Eldon Tyrell plays out by remote across a chessboard. It's a pivotal scene, and the moment Tyrell succumbs to defeat by unintentionally welcoming Batty in to his private quarters. But how does it translate to film? \\"Queen to bishop six, check,\\" is the initial attack. \\"Knight takes queen,\\" the retort. The final blow: \\"Bishop to king seven. Checkmate.\\" As Tyrell himself articulates: \\"Nonsense.\\" And sadly, to the vast majority of viewers, it most likely is. Chess enthusiasts might correctly identify this sequence from the Immortal Game, played by Anderssen v Kieseritzky in London in 1851. Similarly, Guy Ritchie weaves a nail-biting game of chess into the climax of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, an on-the-nose metaphor for the action taking place, although Moriarty does offer some exposition for any audience members still confused by the moves: \\"May I remind you this is blitz chess – a single miscalculation will cost you the game.\\" Reading on mobile? Click here to view video Sometimes, however, it is courtship, not a battle. In The Thomas Crown Affair an extended chess encounter between the two protagonists is thick with sexual tension. To the uninitiated, an early castling by Crown probably looks foolish, but the chess is merely a backdrop for the sultry Vicki Anderson to flash a little side cleavage and raise the temperature. Indeed, Thomas Crown is shown to be distinctly hot under the collar, and ultimately the game ends off the board, with checkmate between the sheets … (Incidentally, this scene is hilariously parodied in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) One of the difficulties for directors is to convey on film the momentous significance of movements on the board. Even for amateurs, but especially for the layman, easily visualising a chessboard is a rare ability, and a failure to visualise – let alone comprehend and interpret the positional strengths of the pieces – means any subtle shift in the power play is lost. In most other sports, a simple cutaway to the scoreboard telegraphs the balance of the game; and the actions of the players (netting goals, batting sixes or whatever) demonstrates the strength of one team or player over the other. The inability to portray chess in the same tangible fashion is doubtless one reason it's so often shirked by film-makers. Perhaps this is why one of the most successful integrations of chess within film is actually in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where JK Rowling placed the characters on a giant board, and where a wrong move results in destruction and sacrifice. It is concrete, visceral and accessible – not to mention wonderfully realised by director Chris Columbus. Reading on mobile? Click here to view video None of this is to say that films using chess as their primary focus haven't been attempted. European cinema has produced many engaging pictures. Back in 1925, the silent Soviet Union short comedy Chess Fever starred the chess world champion José Raúl Capablanca, among cameos from other famed players, and in 1957, Bergman's The Seventh Seal saw the ultimate chess game as a man plays the grim reaper. Switzerland has comedy Ivory Tower (2010), France has The Chess Player (1927) and Dangerous Moves (1984). The Netherlands produced Long Live the Queen (1995), a beautifully poignant fairy tale, while Germany crafted Three Moves to Freedom (1960). In English language cinema, however, chess films are few and far between and, for the most part, woefully underwhelming. Probably the most successful and certainly the most straightforward sports drama, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), is excellent, touching and well acted, charting the development of chess whizz Josh Waitzkin from anonymity to acclaim. It's an anomaly in film – a triumphant display, easily rivaling other sport biopics, where chess really is the centrepiece. A year later and a few rungs down the ladder hangs Fresh, in which a drug runner and prodigy chess player apply the game's tactics to find an edge in the real world. It's an enthralling movie, and the inclusion of chess is certainly more than perfunctory, but it nonetheless takes a backseat to drug dealing. And would a real chess film make the grievous error of messing up the gameplay? Escaping a check with another check is an invalid move! In addition to Searching and Fresh, the 90s saw a spate of substandard crime thrillers, each seeking to portray a sinister side to chess. Knight Moves (not to be confused with the decent 1975 Gene Hackman crime thriller, Night Moves) arrived in 1992, and was an overly sincere attempt to entwine the game with a serial killer noir. Unsurprisingly, sauciness and chess isn't confined to The Thomas Crown Affair. Indeed, sex and chess seems to be a persistent theme, the former being the one reliable antidote to all things deemed too dull for audience viewing. Between passionate bouts of intercourse, Knight Moves explores the egos behind chess, suggesting high intelligence and mentally deranged psychopaths are par for the course. In doing so, it strips aside the significance of the game's setting, and ultimately draws on the same box of tricks as every other psycho-killer thriller. Perhaps taking cues from the latter, director Jim McBride unleashed Uncovered, a film that makes every effort to prove that chess goes hand in hand with crime and intrigue, where the chess pieces are the clues to murder and are taken entirely literally, knight for knight, castle for castle. Release in 1994, it's unbelievably bad, but speaks volumes of the attempts to sex up chess for public consumption. An utterly bizarre sexual undercurrent throughout, way beyond ordinary 90s smut, includes one memorable scene in which lead actress Kate Beckinsale, 19 at the time, is reflected fully naked in the chessboard, her breasts literally overlaid upon the pieces. It doesn't get any more obvious than that: chess can be sexy! It's vexing because it could have been good, but Knight Moves is stylistically closer to an X-rated episode of Miss Marple than Se7en. Then there was The Luzhin Defence, in 2000, a chess romance and adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense, a novel loosely based on German chess master Curt von Bardeleben. The film is less to do with chess than with social distinctions and improprieties, with John Turturro's character, Aleksandr Luzhin, socially dysfunctional, scruffy and stammering. He's practically damaged by his genius, deliberately painted as an oddity. By association, chess is tarred with the same brush, as the domain of weirdos. More than a decade on and despite tackling a different genre, Computer Chess, unfortunately, isn't really any different, mumblecore or nay. The comic basis for the film is the social awkwardness and idiosyncracies of chess and programming enthusiasts. I'm not convinced that the mockery of these nerdy individuals is affectionate, or if it further reinforces the misplaced perception that chess is just the horseplay of freaks and geeks. In fact, that unfamiliar, oddball environment appears to be precisely the attraction for the director: \\"Given the nature of the story in Computer Chess and what we were trying to do, there was no imperative at all to be tasteful,\\" Bujalski told the New Statesman. \\"We could be as absurd as we liked and call as much attention to ourselves as we liked.\\" Oh, and it also features full frontal nudity (albeit in a uniquely surreal fashion). Films like Computer Chess don't do the game any favours, appealing to a niche within a niche and further estranging those who were already skeptical or disinterested. If chess is ever to reach a wider audience and greater popularity, it'll need something considerably more compelling to stack the board in its favour. Maybe it's true that board games really aren't spectator sports, but I can't help but think that we can do better than this. There's a better endgame out there. • Peter Bradshaw's review of Computer Chess• Computer Chess: watch the trailer Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Chess has struggled to find a strong presence in film, often relegated to a prop to emphasize intellect or cunning, or as an analogy for a scheming mind.

Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Which country will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas? Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] A:","output":"Based on the provided information and considering the concept of distance decay, it is clear that the country that focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology would be better positioned in terms of development. In this case, Niger developed its infrastructure and communication technology, while Nigeria did not. By improving these areas, Niger increased its ability to stay connected with other countries, access information, and maintain cultural and spatial interactions. As a result, they would experience a lesser effect of distance decay. On the other hand, Nigeria, which did not focus on improving its infrastructure and communication technology, would suffer more from the effects of distance decay. The lack of connectivity and efficient communication channels would cause their interactions with neighboring countries to decrease significantly. Therefore, Nigeria would be less developed as a consequence of their political and economic agendas, compared to Niger."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"uh-huh yeah that's about that's about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We have a good classical station here and that is mostly what I listen to on my commute.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis, we will first identify the key information from the premise and then compare it to the hypothesis. Step 1: Break down the premise: The main points in the premise are: 1. The person primarily listens to classical music. 2. There is a good classical radio station in the area. Step 2: Break down the hypothesis: The key points in the hypothesis are: 1. There is a good classical station in the area. 2. The person mostly listens to this station while commuting. Step 3: Compare the information in the premise and the hypothesis: Both the premise and the hypothesis agree on the existence of a good classical radio station in the area.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings.

Suggested answer: Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product in the United States. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"While the suggested answer provides a brief introduction to Grecian Formula, it does not comprehensively explain how it works. Below is a more detailed and long answer to help you understand how Grecian Formula works and expands on its use as a hair coloring product: Grecian Formula, a popular men's hair coloring product primarily in the United States, is designed to gradually restore natural color to graying hair. Unlike most hair dyes that provide an immediate and intense color change, Grecian Formula works progressively over time, allowing users to have more control over the desired shade and avoid a sudden, dramatic shift in hair color. The key ingredient in Grecian Formula is lead acetate, although some newer versions use bismuth citrate as an alternative due to safety concerns with lead. These ingredients function as color restorers by reacting with sulfur in hair keratin, which is a fibrous protein that forms the structural foundation of hair. As hair naturally contains sulfur, these ingredients can selectively interact with the sulfur atoms in gray or colorless hair strands, forming colored lead or bismuth sulfide complexes in the process. Grecian Formula works best when applied daily to clean, dry hair. Each day of application results in a minor color change that, when accumulated over a period of several weeks, ultimately restores hair to its original, natural hue. The formula is designed to target only gray strands, so it blends with the user's natural color effectively. To maintain the desired shade, subsequent applications can be reduced to once or twice a week, depending on the individual's preference and hair growth rate. A significant advantage of Grecian Formula over traditional hair dyes is that it does not leave a visible demarcation line between the colored and new hair growth, as the color is restored gradually. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, Grecian Formula has faced some controversy due to the presence of lead acetate, which is a known toxic compound. Prolonged exposure to lead has been associated with neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive health issues. However, the amount of lead acetate present in Grecian Formula is relatively small, and the risk of harmful exposure through skin contact is considered low. Nevertheless, the European Union has banned the use of lead acetate in cosmetic products, which has resulted in the utilization of alternative ingredients like bismuth citrate in some versions of the Grecian Formula. In conclusion, Grecian Formula is a hair coloring product that functions by gradually restoring the natural color of graying hair through the formation of colored complexes within hair keratin. Its progressive action allows for increased control, reduces the risk of an unnatural appearance, and avoids a sudden, dramatic color change that some people may find undesirable. However, the use of lead acetate has raised some safety concerns, prompting the development of alternative ingredients in other versions of the product."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the below conversation.

According to a close friend, he and Crazy Horse \\"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Encouraging Bear, an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to the Oglala war leader, reported that Crazy Horse was born \\"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840-41. Crazy Horse is commemorated by the incomplete Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, near the town of Berne. Like the nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial, it is a monument carved out of a mountainside. The sculpture was begun by Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who had worked under Gutzon Borglum on Mount Rushmore, in 1948. Plans call for the completed monument to be 641 feet (195 m) wide and 563 feet (172 m) high. Ziolkowski was inspired to create the Crazy Horse Memorial after receiving a letter from native Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear, who asked if Ziolkowski would be interested in creating a monument for the native North Americans to show that the Indian nations also have their heroes. The Native Americans consider Thunderhead Mountain, where the monument is being carved, to be sacred ground. Thunderhead Mountain is situated between Custer and Hill City. Upon completion, the head of Crazy Horse will be the world's largest sculpture of the human head, measuring approximately 87 feet (27 m) tall, more than 27 feet taller than the 60-foot faces of the U.S. Presidents depicted on Mount Rushmore, and the Crazy Horse Memorial as a whole will be the largest sculpture in the world. The memorial is funded entirely by private donations, with no assistance from the U.S. federal government. There is no target completion date at this time; however, in 1998, the face of Crazy Horse was completed and dedicated. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation regularly takes the lead in cultural, social and educational events, including the Volksmarch, the occasion on which the public is allowed into the actual monument grounds. The foundation generates most of its funds from visitor fees, with visitors numbering more than one million annually. The monument has been the subject of controversy. In Ziolkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans. It is well-known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of Crazy Horse himself. Aside from the monumental sculpture, Crazy Horse has also been honored by having two highways named after him, both called the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. In South Dakota, the designation has been applied to a portion of US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial. In November 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US 20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron. The designation may extend east another 100 miles through Cherry County to Valentine.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has added his voice to Sportsmail's campaign to stop the amount of fouls that take place in penalty boxes across the Premier League. The Hands Off In The Box campaign aims to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area. Acts such as wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling are now commonplace, as was so shockingly illustrated in the 1-1 draw between Manchester United and Chelsea on Sunday as Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling manhandled John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic respectively to the ground in brutal fashion. Both United defenders went unpunished. And the Manchester City manager has revealed that he shares the concerns that many have over the amount of blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. 'When the Premier League managers met [with referees] at the start of the season, this was one of the things we talked about,' he said. 'We said that that there was a lot going on and that were a lot of penalties [not being given]. 'It is definitely something that happens and it is very hard for the referees. 'Equally, there are lots of fouls of goalkeepers – where the goalkeeper is not being allowed to move – and that is a problem also.' But Sportsmail feels that enough is enough. It's time referees and assistants eradicated bodychecking and wrestling inside the box, just as tackles from behind have been, and reckless challenges are in the process of being now. Guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are, referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders. Chris Smalling manhandles Branislav Ivanovic (left) to the ground, while John Terry wrestles with Marcos Rojo. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini adds his voice to Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign. Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) did concede a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week. Martin Skrtel (second left) grabs hold of Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker's shirt at a set piece in February. John Terry, Chelsea captain. ‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’ Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager. ‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker. ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll, Former top referee. ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender. ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager. ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath. ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Hands Off In The Box campaign aims to eradicate the ongoing issue of unfair plays in football's penalty areas, such as wrestling, grappling, and shirt pulling. The campaign emphasizes that it is high time that referees and assistants take strict actions against players who indulge in these actions to prevent opponents from scoring. Manchester City manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has supported the initiative, stating that such fouls have increased and are causing problems for referees and goalkeepers alike. The campaign aims to name and shame guilty defenders and bring attention to the cheating behavior that is preventing a fair game in the Premier League.

Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds and safflower seeds. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding, an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, with an estimated global range of 5,800,000 km (2,200,000 sq mi) and a global population of some 100 million. Populations appear to remain stable and not threatened to reach the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations. It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song. In the United States, this species receives special legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which also banned their sale as cage birds. It is also protected by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada.

In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it?, what is it ?

What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"In what ways does the global healthcare marketplace influence the United States healthcare marketplace? The global healthcare marketplace influences the United States healthcare marketplace in various ways, including the following: 1. Cost and pricing: Global competition and pricing can impact the cost of healthcare goods and services in the United States. This may include the prices of medications, medical devices, and even services provided by healthcare professionals. Competition can drive down prices or lead to innovations that enable more cost-effective solutions. 2. Medical tourism: With an increasing number of patients seeking care abroad, the US healthcare industry is pushed to deliver high-quality services at a competitive price. Medical tourism is a result of global healthcare marketplace competition, and in return, it forces the US market to improve to retain domestic utilization of healthcare services. 3. Regulatory environment: Global standards and policy initiatives can influence the US healthcare system. This may manifest in the form of adopting guidelines from international regulating bodies, such as the World Health Organization, or through global agreements that may impact the availability of certain healthcare products and services. 4. Research and innovation: The global healthcare marketplace drives research and development in the medical field, as countries compete to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This can lead to collaborations between research institutions in the United States and other countries, potentially accelerating the development of new treatments or technologies. 5. Public health: As the world becomes more connected, the effects of a public health crisis in one country can quickly spill over into another. This can influence the allocation of resources within the United States healthcare system, as the country may need to address global outbreaks or prepare for potential pandemics. 6. Workforce issues: The global healthcare marketplace can impact the healthcare workforce in the United States, in terms of both supply and demand. The US relies on foreign-trained healthcare professionals to fill workforce gaps, and global competition for these professionals may impact the availability of providers in the United States. Additionally, healthcare professionals from the US may seek opportunities abroad for professional development or financial reasons. What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? In the event a tourist is unable to pay the bill for giving birth in the United States or Canada, various consequences may arise: 1. Negotiation: Hospitals may work with the patient to negotiate a payment plan, which allows the patient to pay off the bill gradually over an extended period instead of paying the full amount upfront. 2. Charity care: Some hospitals may offer charity care or financial assistance programs to help cover the expenses of uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. 3. Debt collection: Hospitals may resort to debt collection measures, such as engaging a collection agency, filing a lawsuit, or placing a lien on any property owned by the patient in the United States. This may negatively impact the patient's credit rating and ability to travel in the future. 4. Impact on immigration: Unpaid medical bills can result in negative consequences for the individual's immigration status, such as being denied entry to the country in the future, or having difficulty obtaining visas or permanent residency. However, it is essential to note that the exact steps taken will differ depending on the hospital's policies, the patient's individual circumstances, and the severity of the unpaid bill. Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? These two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the ways the global healthcare marketplace can impact the United States healthcare marketplace, whereas the second question is about the consequences of a tourist being unable to pay the bill for childbirth in the United States or Canada.

This family is commonly referred to as the thrush family and is known for its diverse range of bird species that are typically medium-sized, monogamous, and ground-dwelling. Turdidae is comprised of approximately 180 species of birds, including some highly recognized members like the American Robin, the Eurasian Blackbird, and various other Thrushes and Bluebirds. These birds are widely distributed across regions such as Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Turdidae birds are predominantly known for their melodious and complex songs, which are often injected into their territories. The European Robin, in particular, is a small songbird that is commonly found in gardens and woodlands throughout Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking reddish-orange breast and face, brownish-grey upperparts, and white belly. Robins, like other thrushes, are omnivorous birds that mainly feed on invertebrates (such as insects and earthworms) and fruits. They are typically solitary foragers, catching insects on the ground or from the lower branches of trees and shrubs. During the breeding season, their diet shifts more towards invertebrates, providing essential proteins to their young offspring. The birds in the Turdidae family engage in lifelong monogamous relationships, setting up territories during the breeding season and zealously defending them from rivals. The male Robin plays a significant role in attracting a mate by singing complex and melodious songs, occupying several perches within its territory as it aims to advertise its presence and attract a female partner. The female, after selecting her mate, primarily takes responsibility for constructing the nest and laying the eggs, whereas both parents contribute to incubation and chick rearing. The habitat of Turdidae birds varies across species; while some thrive in dense forests, others can be found in open woodlands, gardens, or parks. Most of the Turdidae species are migratory, with their breeding grounds in the higher latitudes while their wintering grounds extend towards the warmer southern regions. In conclusion, the Robin belongs to the Turdidae family, commonly known as the thrush family. This family comprises approximately 180 bird species characterized by their melodious songs, monogamous relationships, and a wide range of habitats, from dense forests to open grounds. Their diets include invertebrates and fruits, with a preference for invertebrates during the breeding season. Additionally, Turdidae birds are known for their migratory habits, which are essential in their quest to find suitable breeding grounds and climatic conditions."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Dennis writes from Mexico to Ronnie. for the following movie plot: An anonymous flasher exposes himself to shoppers in the Forest Ridge Mall parking lot.

Use a stud finder to see if the space above your door is a solid header. Look for a solid section of wood that would indicate a header was installed and the wall is load-bearing. If the space above a doorway on the wall is hollow, then it’s likely not a load-bearing wall. Check the beneath the wall to see if it’s stacked on another wall. Go to the first floor, basement, pilings, or crawlspace and look to see if there are piers or girders underneath the wall that would indicate that it is a load-bearing wall. If there is, then it is likely a load-bearing wall. If the wall you plan to knock down is on the second floor, check to see if there’s a wall in the exact same place on the floor below it. Piers or girders look like solid metal beams and are used to support structures. If you see them below your wall, then it means the wall also supports the weight of the building. If you see pylons, which look like large posts, beneath your wall, it means your wall is load-bearing. Be careful crawling beneath the structure to inspect the walls. If the wall runs through the center of the building and is beneath the trusses or frame of the structure, then it may be a load-bearing wall. Just because the wall runs parallel to the framing above it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s load-bearing, but it is a sign that it could be and it needs to be confirmed before you try to knock it down. If you see ceiling or floor joists at the edges of the wall, then it’s definitely a load-bearing wall. If you have the original blueprints of the building, there should be a key that includes markings to indicate which walls are load-bearing. Look for an “S” which means “Structural” near walls, joists, and other features on the blueprint. Look for the wall you plan to knock down and determine whether it’s structural or not. Read the blueprints closely to look for indicators that a wall is load-bearing. Use the key to identify structural features. The best way to determine that a wall isn’t load-bearing is to hire a structural engineer to come out and inspect it.

Learn more ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court kept Texas' voting maps largely intact Monday, dealing an election-year blow to Democrats by reversing earlier findings that intentional racial discrimination continues to stain several statehouse and congressional districts. The 5-4 decision comes nine months after Democrats had celebrated lower court rulings that invalidated parts of Texas' electoral maps and a revised voter ID law. But the voter ID law was also restored in April, and Texas Republicans now have another key victory in long-running battles over voting rights in a state with a booming Hispanic population. \\"Our legislative maps are legal. Democrats lost their redistricting & Voter ID claims,\\" Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted. The decision also dampened Democrats' case that Texas should once again need federal approval before changing voting laws, a requirement the Supreme Court eliminated in 2013 when it gutted the heart of the federal Voting Rights Act. In August, a federal court in San Antonio agreed with Democrats and voting rights groups that current electoral districts in Texas were tainted by earlier and intentionally discriminatory map lines first approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2011. But Justice Samuel Alito said for the court's conservative majority that the lower court made a mistake by striking down two congressional and seven state house districts. The high court struck down one safe Democratic House district in Fort Worth because the state relied too heavily on race when it increased the district's Latino population. \\"We now hold that the three-judge court committed a fundamental legal error,\\" Alito wrote. The lower court ignored evidence showing that the legislature adopted districting plans in 2013 primarily to try to end the litigation over the districts, Alito said. The court's liberal justices dissented. \\"The court today does great damage to that right of equal opportunity,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. She said her colleagues had blinded themselves \\"to the overwhelming factual record below. It does all of this to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.\\" Democrats are outnumbered nearly 2-1 in the Texas Legislature and have long contended that unfair maps have accelerated that imbalance. In 2009, Republicans had only a slim two-seat majority in the Texas House. \\"The rules were changed today,\\" said Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia, chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. Texas' congressional and legislative districting plans have been embroiled in court action for years, beginning in 2011. After the state's original maps were tossed out as probably unconstitutional, a three-judge federal court produced interim districting plans that were used in the 2012 elections. In 2013, Republicans who control the state government rushed to permanently adopt those maps to use for the rest of the decade, until a new round of redistricting after the 2020 census. But opponents criticized the adopted maps as a quick fix that didn't purge all districts of the impermissible use of race. \\"This is a huge win for the Constitution, Texas, and the democratic process. Once again, Texans have the power to govern themselves,\\" Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said. ___ Weber reported from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Supreme Court in the United States made a decision about voting maps in Texas. They said that most of the maps are okay and can stay as they are. This is good news for the Republican Party in Texas and not so good for the Democratic Party.

Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

Measure out the required amounts of flour and cold butter according to your recipe. For a typical pastry recipe, about 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of cold butter (cut into small cubes) should be used. 2. Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and add the cubed butter. 3. Using clean hands, start mixing the flour and butter by picking up small amounts of the flour and butter between your fingertips. 4. Use a rubbing motion with your fingers to gently press the flour and butter together. This motion should resemble snapping your fingers or rubbing your fingertips against your thumb, ensuring you lift your hands above the bowl to aerate the mixture. 5. Continue this process, working through the flour and butter until all the butter has been incorporated into the mixture. The end result should resemble breadcrumbs with some pea-sized lumps of butter throughout. 6.

Vanucci is in prison. He knows about the smuggling contract, but is reluctant to accept it, because he does not want to disgrace his mother and young sister, Gina (Britt Ekland). However, when his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, over-protective Vanucci vows to escape. He succeeds by impersonating the prison doctor and convincing the guards that Vanucci has tied him up and escaped.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A Tory holds a political philosophy (Toryism) based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \\"God, King and Country\\". Tories generally advocate monarchism, are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage, and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction. In Britain, the Tory political faction originated with the Cavaliers during the English Civil War. This political philosophy remains prominent in the politics of the United Kingdom, and also appears in parts of the Commonwealth realms, particularly in Canada. It also had exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War. Under the Corn Laws (18151846) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency, and enhanced wages in rural employment. - The United Kingdom is a unitary state with devolution governed within the framework of a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state and the prime minister of the United Kingdom, currently Theresa May, is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the British government, on behalf of and by the consent of the monarch, as well as by the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, and the Northern Ireland Executive. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. - The Corn Laws were measures enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846, which imposed restrictions and tariffs on imported grain. They were designed to keep grain prices high to favour domestic producers. The laws did indeed raise food prices and became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural Britain. The Corn Laws imposed steep import duties, making it too expensive to import grain from abroad, even when food supplies were short. The laws were supported by Conservative landowners and opposed by Whig industrialists and workers. The Anti-Corn Law League was responsible for turning public and elite opinion against the laws, in a large, nationwide middle-class moral crusade with a Utopian vision. - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms. As of 2017, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Barbados, Grenada, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, and the United Kingdom. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - William Gordon , 2nd Earl of Aberdeen ( 1679 -- 30 March 1746 ) , known between c. 1691 and 1720 as Lord Haddo , was a Scottish peer , Tory politician and Jacobite .

While the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects of the meal, such as the good cuts of meat and the perfectly cooked filets, the overall tone of the review is focused on their disappointment with both the price and the quality of the scallops. The key phrases indicating the negative nature of the review include \\"not particularly impressive\\" when discussing the steak, and \\"real disappointment\\" in reference to the scallops. The author also set their expectations based on the reputation and class of the establishment, and was let down when their meal failed to meet those expectations. Furthermore, the author seems unsatisfied with the value provided by the dish, as they suggest that the 40 per plate price tag is too high given the level of quality. In summary, while the reviewer does acknowledge a few positive elements in the dish, the overall message is one of disappointment with the meal's quality and value, which labels it as a negative review.

Article: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

There are tons of different areas or niches for mediation work. There is no one single way to become a generalized mediator. What you learn, where you look, who you network with are all going to be dependent on what type of mediating you decide to do. For example, if you wanted to go into family mediation (dealing with children, with divorce, domestic violence, and so on) you would need to be certified in behavioral or social sciences as well as in child development. Mediating workplace disputes would require knowledge specific to the workplace and to the laws and practices therein. It's even better if you have experience dealing with matters particular to that specific workplace, or type of workplace (for example, dealing specifically with factory issues, or mining litigation). Other types of mediation niches include: environmental, art, education, malpractice, criminal justice, landlord/tenant, gay/lesbian, and so on. The best way to get a feel for what is required of a mediator is to talk to someone who is or has done it. It's especially good to find someone in your specific area. While talking to someone who mediates art disputes could be informative, it won't have the same information needed if you're looking to go into workplace disputes. Go to conferences. There are tons of conferences devoted to mediation all around the world. Check and see if there are any in your area (for the U.S., for example, Chicago, New York, and various parts of California hold large mediation conferences yearly). Get a feel for how the system works. When you do meet with someone who is a mediator, you'll want to find out how the system works so you can be as effective as you possibly can. This includes finding out what the work environment is like, what their advice is for getting established, and who decides which mediators are established. Get a feel for what you need to know. Ask them about the types of laws, and rules you'll need to know, and education background that you'll need to have. Depending on the niche you decided to work in you may not need a master's degree, but it can definitely help your credentials. Proving that you have experience with the topic is important if you want to be successful as a mediator. Remember that if you wanted to mediate in Family Law, you would need a background (preferably a master's or a PhD) in behavioral or social sciences as well as family and child development. It's also not a bad idea to get a degree in conflict resolution, as universities and colleges are increasingly offering this opportunity, If you decided to be a civil, general equity, or probate mediator you would need to have at least five years of professional experience in your field of expertise as well as an advanced degree and a minimum of two successfully mediated cases within the last year, or an undergraduate degree and a minimum of ten successfully mediated cases within the last five years. Often if you get your PhD in your chosen subject the courts waive your need to have a certain number of successfully mediated case. Either that or the reduce the amount of successfully mediated cases you need to have. Mediation doesn't require any specific qualifications (except in Florida which has qualification requirements). There are certain qualification classes you can take, but usually these only give you the qualification that you completed the course, without guaranteeing that you are actually a certified mediator. You should go to school in your chosen field (art mediation, or law mediation, environmental mediation) and get a degree that shows you know that area well. Having a law degree can be incredibly useful, because it shows that you know and understand law, especially laws in a particular area. To get listed as a professional you typically have to have several years of experience with mediation (internship, community mediation volunteer, etc.). Summary:","output":"To become a mediator, you should choose a specific area, learn and gain experience in that field, and talk to professionals to understand how the system works and what qualifications you might need."},{"instruction":"Background: Dennis Coles (born May 9, 1970), better known by his stage name Ghostface Killah, is an American rapper and member of the Wu-Tang Clan. After the group achieved breakthrough success in the aftermath of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), the members went on to pursue solo careers to varying levels of success. Ghostface Killah debuted his solo-career with Ironman in 1996, which was well received by music critics. He has continued his success over the following years with critically acclaimed albums such as Supreme Clientele (2000) and Fishscale (2006). Context: Ghostface released a collaborative album with D-Block member Sheek Louch called Wu Block.

Test this reaction in your horse by bumping them with an open palm near the girth where you would bump them with your calf. They should move away from your hand, possibly already in a side pass. Continue bumping your horse near the girth with added pressure if they do not respond to you. As soon as they take a step away, release pressure and reward them. Practice this until your horse needs only a single bump, or no bump at all (just pushing energy with your hand towards their girth), in order to move away from you. Put your horse on a lead rope, and if necessary grab a crop. Stand so that your body is positioned slightly behind the barrel of your horse’s body, and gesture with your arm or crop towards their shoulder. If they do not respond to this, then apply pressure on their shoulder. The goal is to get them to move away from your pressure by rotating their body around their back legs. If your horse turns away or simply walks in the opposite direction rather than crossing their front legs in a turn, grab the lead rope and hold them straight ahead. As soon as your horse crosses their front legs in a turn on the haunch, release pressure, drop your eyes, and reward them for doing what you asked. Continue practicing a turn on the haunch on the ground, so that your horse will respond to the same cues when riding. Similar to a turn on the haunch, a turn on the forehand is done when your horse rotates their entire body around their front legs by crossing their back legs. Accomplish this by standing near the shoulder (to block shoulder/forward movement) and gesturing towards the haunch with your crop or open hands. If they don’t respond without pressure, add a bit by pushing against the haunch with your open hands, or tapping them with the crop. Don’t remove pressure if your horse simply backs away or turns to the side. Straighten them out if necessary, but continue bumping with pressure until they take at least one step by crossing their legs. As soon as your horse achieves a single step in a turn on the forehand, release pressure and reward them for following your cues. Practice this over and over until your horse requires a minimal amount of pressure to accomplish a turn on the forehand. Stand next to your horse near the barrel of their body, using a crop if necessary. Bump the girth of the horse to tell them to move away; if they don’t move how you want, give them the cues for a turn on the haunch and a turn on the forehand. Continue working back and forth between your cues until your horse clues in and does at least a single successful step in a side pass. Reward your horse and release pressure as soon as they take even a single step in the form of a side pass. Continue doing this until they don’t need to be cued for a turn on the forehand and a turn on the haunch in order to recreate a side pass. Eventually they should only need to be bumped on their side near the girth. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on training a horse to respond to pressure cues for various movements, particularly focusing on the side pass, turn on the haunch, and turn on the forehand. It emphasizes the importance of applying pressure in the right areas to elicit the desired response, gradually reducing the pressure needed, and rewarding the horse after each successful step. The process involves practicing these cues on the ground before attempting them while riding, ensuring the horse is familiar and comfortable with the commands."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Why does the fish have to alert the shrimp of danger?\\" Context: \\"A further example is the goby fish, which sometimes lives together with a shrimp. The shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby fish live. The shrimp is almost blind, leaving it vulnerable to predators when outside its burrow. In case of danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it. When that happens both the shrimp and goby fish quickly retreat into the burrow. Different species of gobies (Elacatinus spp.) also exhibit mutualistic behavior through cleaning up ectoparasites in other fish.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The fish, specifically the goby fish, has to alert the shrimp of danger due to their mutualistic relationship and the shrimp's vulnerability to predators given its limited vision. In this symbiotic partnership, both the goby and the shrimp rely on each other for survival and protection. The shrimp, with its excellent burrowing skills, creates and maintains a shared home in the sand for both it and the goby fish. This provides a crucial shelter for both organisms, protecting them from potential predators. However, the shrimp's poor eyesight leaves it without an effective way to know when a potential threat is nearby while outside of its burrow. On the other hand, the goby fish has excellent vision and can keep a keen eye out for predators. Its role in this partnership is to act as an alarm system for potential dangers, ensuring the shrimp remains protected. When the goby fish senses a threat nearby, it uses its tail to touch the shrimp, signaling that a predator is nearby and that they both need to retreat to the safety of their burrow. In addition to this dynamic, different species of gobies (Elacatinus spp.) contribute further to fostering a diverse range of mutualistic relationships through their cleaning services. By removing ectoparasites from other fish, they provide a form of \\"hygienic service\\" that benefits both the goby and the fish being cleaned. The cleaner goby fish in this case receives food (the ectoparasites), while the fish being cleaned benefits from reduced parasitic infections and increased overall health. The goby fish and shrimp relationship is a prime example of mutualistic symbiosis, in which both species depend on each other to survive and thrive. The goby fish's ability to detect danger combined with its various cleaning-related behaviors greatly benefit the shrimp, while the shrimp provides the goby with a valuable, secure shelter and a place to call home. In essence, the goby fish must alert the shrimp of danger to honor their symbiotic partnership and ensure their mutual survival and well-being in an environment filled with potential threats."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"A man with a tattoo on one arm and an ear of corn in the other looks at a woman in a yellow shirt.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Tehre is a man with a tattoo.\\"?

So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope. Some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home. So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope (File photo) A further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval. GPs say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and cannot provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Some of the worst-affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments. On top of this, many GPs are retiring, moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession. Figures from NHS England – obtained by GP trade magazine Pulse – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since April. Officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including Surrey, Sussex, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Dr Peter Swinyard is the chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs. Dr Maureen Baker, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘This is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for GPs. Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to, and GPs want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients. ‘No surgery wants to de-register patients. This is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs, with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring.’ So far this year, 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn. Patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will easily find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Some of those removed by a practice in Watton, in Norfolk, now have to make 16-mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘This is people just basically saying, “We are not coping.” They are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients.’ Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable. We must protect GP services and achieve real choice for patients. ‘Patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a GP.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The NHS has approved 25 surgeries in England to shrink their catchment areas due to overstretched GPs. Practices have removed patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers, and care home residents. A further ten surgeries have applied to cut their registers and are awaiting approval. The issue arises from a recruitment crisis with GPs being unable to provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Factors contributing to the crisis include an increasing population due to migrants and elderly couples needing many appointments, GPs retiring, moving overseas, quitting, and a shortage of new doctors entering the profession. This situation is distressing for both patients and GPs. Patients struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery directing them to register elsewhere, with no guarantee they will find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, stated that the shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable and patients must have access to a GP. The situation highlights the desperate need to address the shortage of GPs in the profession and to ensure safe and accessible care for all patients in the local areas."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidal. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected. In Washington D.C., government officials order Colonel Peckem (Lloyd Hollar) to go to Evans City to help contain the virus, while scientist Dr. Watts (Richard France), arrives to develop a cure before the virus spreads beyond the small town. Officials also deploy bombers armed with nuclear weapons, to destroy the town, if necessary. Mayhem begins when the Army quarantines the town, shooting anyone attempting to escape. The soldiers move the townspeople into the high school, and chaos happens when the sheriff (Robert Karlowsky) is shot with his own pistol. While the townspeople are being rousted from their homes, a soldier encounters a quiet elderly woman. He kindly urges the woman to come with him, but she stabs him with her knitting needle. By now, nearly all of the villagers are infected. A group of soldiers are killed by a mob armed...

And I was wondering Why did Remy do this? A:","output":"A: Remy likely decided to use a shock collar to train their pet in an attempt to correct unwanted behaviors and establish a sense of discipline and control over the pet's actions. Before diving deeper into Remy's reasoning, it is important to understand the primary intent behind using such a training tool. Shock collars, also known as electronic collars or e-collars, are designed to deliver a mild electric shock to an animal when they exhibit undesirable behavior. The aim is to create an association between the behavior and a negative stimulus, ultimately reducing or eliminating the occurrence of that behavior. Some pet owners choose to use shock collars as a means of managing their pets' excessive barking, jumping, irritability, or aggressive tendencies. It is worth noting that this method is considered controversial, with animal welfare organizations advocating for positive reinforcement training techniques. Returning to Remy's decision to utilize a shock collar, they may have adopted this method for a number of reasons: 1) Fast results: In comparison to alternative training techniques, shock collars can yield immediate results. Remy may be looking to expedite their pet's learning process, ensuring the animal adopts acceptable behavior in a relatively short time span. 2) Control and safety: Remy may have concerns about their pet's behavior when they are not around, and using a shock collar can potentially offer greater control in managing such behaviors. This is particularly useful if Remy fears their pet may pose a danger to themselves, other animals, or humans. 3) Easily adjustable: Shock collars typically have a range of settings that enable the pet owner to fine-tune the intensity of the shock. Remy may appreciate the customizability of this device, allowing them to adjust the training experience to suit their pet's specific needs. 4) Last resort: It is possible that Remy has tried other training methods, such as positive reinforcement, but found them to be inadequate or ineffective in addressing their pet's behavioral issues. In this case, the shock collar may represent a last resort for Remy to establish the desired level of control and discipline. 5) Trainer recommendation: Remy might have consulted with a professional trainer who, based on their evaluation of the pet and its behavioral problems, suggested using a shock collar as part of a training program. Overall, it seems that Remy has chosen to use a shock collar to train their pet to think before acting due to the potential for immediate results, increased control and safety, adjustability of the device, and possible recommendations from a professional trainer. However, Remy should also be aware of the controversy surrounding shock collars and consider alternative, positive reinforcement-based training methods, as they may prove to be equally effective and are generally more humane."},{"instruction":"Article: High heels were first worn in the 1500s, and were popular with both women and men. Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \\"shoe girl\\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \\"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \\"It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late.\\" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels.

Answer:","output":"Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were both accomplished literary figures who contributed significantly to the world of literature. However, while Hart Crane was primarily known as a poet, Natalia Ginzburg was not strictly a poet, but rather a novelist, essayist, and playwright. To best understand their roles and impact on literature, it is essential to analyze their individual careers and works. Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991) was an Italian author known for her captivating novels, autobiographical narratives, essays, and plays that captured the essence of everyday life, relationships, and emotions. Born in Palermo, Italy, Ginzburg was raised in a family with a rich intellectual and political background. Throughout her life, she remained an active participant in Italian political and social issues. Though not a poet by profession, some of her works did incorporate poetic elements. She authored several novels, including \\"The Road to the City\\" (1942), \\"Family Lexicon\\" (1963), and \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" (1952), alongside numerous essays and plays. Her writing style was often characterized as simple, elegant, and intimate, reflecting her keen observation of human nature. Hart Crane (1899-1932) was an American poet whose writing primarily revolved around the experiences of modern life, love, and disillusionment. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, he was deeply inspired by the works of other well-known poets, such as T.S. Eliot and Walt Whitman. Crane's poetry is infused with rich symbolism, powerful imagery, and a lyrical quality that garnered him a reputation as one of the most influential poets during the early 20th century. Some of his notable works include his debut collection \\"White Buildings\\" (1926) and his masterpiece, \\"The Bridge\\" (1930). Unfortunately, Crane's life was marred by personal struggles with alcoholism, depression, and tumultuous relationships, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 32. In conclusion, while both Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane made significant contributions to literature, they were not both poets in the traditional sense. Ginzburg was primarily a novelist, essayist, and playwright who occasionally infused poetic elements into her works, whereas Hart Crane's primary focus was on poetry. Nonetheless, their unique literary styles and dedication to their craft have earned them a prestigious place in the annals of literary history."},{"instruction":"Information: - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history. It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\". - The Philippine Revolution (Filipino: \\"Himagsikang Pilipino\\"), also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish, was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight. - The Cry of Pugad Lawin ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin ) , alternately and originally referred to as the Cry of Balintawak ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Balíntawak , Spanish : Grito de Balíntawak ) , was the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire . At the close of August 1896 , members of the Katipunan secret society ( Katipuneros ) led by Andrés Bonifacio rose up in revolt somewhere in an area referred to as Kalookan , wider than the jurisdiction of present - day Caloocan City which may have overlapped into present - day Quezon City . Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts . Because of competing accounts and ambiguity of the place where this event took place , the exact date and place of the Cry is in contention . From 1908 until 1963 , the official stance was that the Cry occurred on August 26 in Balintawak . In 1963 the Philippine government declared a shift to August 23 in Pugad Lawin , Quezon City . - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole. Answer this question please: Which researcher learned less about bromine gases? The answer to this question is:","output":"Colt, the researcher who studied air quality over the North Pole, likely learned less about bromine gases compared to Dan, who studied Antarctica. The reason for this is that the ozone hole over Antarctica is largely attributed to chlorine and bromine gases, making it a more relevant location to study these specific pollutants. While bromine gases may still be present in the atmosphere over the North Pole, they are not as significant a factor in ozone depletion in that region. Hence, Dan, studying Antarctica, likely encountered more information concerning bromine gases in his research."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Download SiteSucker from the Mac App Store.

An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. The answer is:","output":"tetA would live longer than tetB. According to the data collected and documented by Aristotle, there are correlations between the life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals). These correlations allow us to draw conclusions about the lifespan of different tetrapods based on their characteristics. In this case, we know that an adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB, and tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Based on Aristotle's findings, we can conclude the following: 1. Tetrapods with a larger body mass tend to have a smaller brood size (number of offspring per reproductive event). 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period (the time an offspring spends developing inside its mother before birth) and with body mass, leading to heavier tetrapods living longer than lighter tetrapods. 3. Fecundity (the total number of offspring produced over a tetrapod's lifetime) decreases with lifespan, meaning that long-lived tetrapods have fewer offspring than short-lived tetrapods. Returning to the original question, weknow that tetA is heavier than tetB and has a longer gestation period. According to Aristotle's findings, these characteristics suggest that tetA has a longer lifespan than tetB, since lifespan increases with both body mass and gestation period. Consequently, we can infer that tetA would live longer than tetB."},{"instruction":"Title: Very Good, Now where's the Rest?

Here, I will provide detailed explanations for both the positive and negative aspects of this phrase. Positive aspects: 1. Creativity and innovation: Low-budget filmmaking often requires filmmakers to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to make the most of limited resources. This can lead to unique and interesting storytelling approaches that differentiate the film from mainstream, high-budget productions. 2. Artistic freedom: With less financial pressure coming from investors and studios, low-budget filmmakers have greater artistic freedom to pursue their vision without compromising on their creativity to fit into specific market demands or expectations. 3. Developing talents: Low-budget filmmaking provides opportunities for upcoming talents to get involved in the industry, gain experience and showcase their skills. This could include actors, writers, directors, and other crew members who may not have had the chance to work on high-budget productions. 4. Niche markets and audiences: Low-budget films often cater to specific niche markets and audiences overlooked by mainstream productions. This allows for more focused and targeted storytelling, enabling filmmakers to explore topics, themes, and genres that resonate deeply with the intended audience. Negative aspects: 1. Limited resources: The most apparent drawback of low-budget filmmaking is the constraint on available resources. This includes constraints on financial resources for paying cast and crew, renting equipment, or funding special effects. Filmmakers may have to make compromises on overall production value, which could potentially impact both the visual quality and storytelling of the film. 2. Reduced marketing and distribution opportunities: With a limited budget, it can be challenging for filmmakers to secure adequate marketing and distribution for their films. This may result in fewer people having the opportunity to watch and appreciate these films. 3. Financial risk: While the stakes in low-budget filmmaking may be lower compared to high-budget productions, there is still a level of financial risk involved. If the film does not perform well or recoup its production costs, it can have an adverse impact on the filmmakers' future projects. 4. Career advancement potential: Working on low-budget films may not necessarily provide the same level of industry recognition compared to larger budget productions. This could potentially limit opportunities for career advancement and growth for individuals involved in low-budget filmmaking. In conclusion, the phrase \\"low-budget filmmaking\\" may carry both positive and negative connotations, depending on how it is perceived. While it offers opportunities for creativity, artistic freedom, talent development, and catering to niche markets, it also presents challenges in terms of resource limitations, marketing, financial risks, and career advancement."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was asked if he still hunts? ? A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"have faith in ALex\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Having faith in Alex as a valid answer to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" would depend on several factors and the context in which the question is asked. It's important to analyze the situation, Alex's role and responsibilities, the expectations and trust of others, and the significance of the answer for the decision-making process. 1. Context: Understanding the context of the question is crucial.

If the answer directly impacts the overall success or progress of a project or a team, putting faith in Alex might be a risky decision unless there's strong evidence to support his expertise. 5. Training and development: As mentioned in your statement, Alex would benefit from some training on site. This implies that Alex still has room for improvement and growth within his role. Depending on the nature and extent of this training, others might be skeptical about having faith in Alex before he's fully developed his skills. 6.

While having faith in Alex might be relevant in some cases, there could be other factors or suggestions that hold more weight and are deemed more valid by the rest of the team or organization.

It's essential to evaluate the situation comprehensively and gather relevant information to make an informed decision about whether having faith in Alex is the most appropriate answer."},{"instruction":"Next question: when was call of duty advanced warfare released?","output":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision.

Depression was a constant struggle for Rebecca but not for Amy, because Choose your answer from: (1). Rebecca was a positive optimist.. (2). Amy was a positive optimist..","output":"(2). Amy was a positive optimist. Depression was a constant struggle for Rebecca but not for Amy, because Amy was a positive optimist. While both Rebecca and Amy faced challenges and hardships in life, their different perspectives and coping mechanisms played a crucial role in how they managed their mental health. Rebecca, who was constantly struggling with depression, might have experienced a series of negative thoughts, low self-esteem, and hopelessness, leading to a cycle of despair and difficulty in overcoming life's challenges. Her depression would likely affect multiple areas of her life, such as work, relationships, and general well-being. She may find it challenging to engage in activities that she once enjoyed, feel withdrawn and isolated from friends and family, and struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, Amy, as a positive optimist, exhibited a more hopeful and resilient attitude in the face of adversity. Optimism is a psychological trait that helps individuals to see the brighter side of things and anticipate positive outcomes even in difficult times. Amy's positive outlook would undoubtedly contribute to her ability to bounce back from hardships, maintain a more stable emotional state, and lessen the likelihood of experiencing clinical depression. Amy's optimistic approach equips her with a beneficial set of coping mechanisms that help her navigate through the ups and downs of life more effectively. She may be more open to seeking social support, engaging in pleasant activities, and pursuing personal growth and development. Furthermore, her natural tendency to focus on the positives could also have a tangible impact on her physical health, as numerous studies have suggested that optimistic individuals are less prone to stress-related illnesses and generally have stronger immune systems. It is essential to recognize that, while optimism can be a protective factor against depression, it is not an absolute guarantee against developing mental health issues. External factors, genetics, and other predispositions can still contribute to a person's likelihood of experiencing depression or other mental health conditions. Nevertheless, the optimistic approach adopted by Amy provides her with a valuable set of emotional and mental tools that buffer against the detrimental effects of stress and adversity. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Depression was a constant struggle for Rebecca but not for Amy, because Amy was a positive optimist\\" underscores the significance of maintaining a positive outlook in life and the potential benefits of optimism on one's mental health. Both having optimism and learning healthy coping mechanisms can help individuals navigate through challenges more effectively and reduce the likelihood of experiencing depression. However, it is also important to remember that in some cases, external factors or predispositions might still lead to the development of mental health issues. In such cases, seeking professional help and appropriate interventions is vital to managing one's mental health and well-being."},{"instruction":"military people wear their careers over their hearts and on their sleeves .

Answer the above question based on the context below: The film starts off with a scene from the novel Moby Dick, with a whaler on a stormy sea in the 19th century, chasing \\"the white whale\\". It turns out that the scene comes from the imagination of Dot, while she is sitting with the book. She goes out to play with Nelson the dolphin in his pool, and he teaches her how to stay underwater for long periods of time and to communicate underwater, as well as the history and evolution of sea creatures. While they play together, Nelson hears the wail of a beached whale named \\"Tonga\\" from the local coast, and jumps out of his pool, over the cliff beside, and dives into the ocean on the other side, to check what is going on, with Dot coming along. Dot walks up on land to talk with Tonga, but becomes upset as two boys, Alex and Owen, stand and throw sand on the whale. The boys say that they only want to push the whale back to the sea. Together, they try to push Tonga back to the water, but fail. They decide to gather as many kids as possible, in order to help the whale as much as they can.

She is one of seven children, with older brothers Michael Damien (1939-1958), Patrick (1942-2009), younger brother John Charles (born 1946); and younger sisters Prudence and actresses Stephanie and Tisa. Her eldest brother, Michael Farrow, died in a plane crash in 1958, at age 19; Patrick, a sculptor, committed suicide in 2009; and John Charles was in 2013 sentenced to 25 years in prison for child molestation, for sexually abusing two boys over a period of eight years. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Farrow's relationship with director Woody Allen resulted in numerous film collaborations. She appeared in nearly all of Allen's films during this period, including leading roles in Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Hannah and Her Sisters, Radio Days and Alice (1990). Farrow played Alura, mother of Kara (Helen Slater), in Supergirl (1984) and voiced the title role in the animated film The Last Unicorn (1982). She narrated several of the animated Stories to Remember. Allen said that the way she played her character in Broadway Danny Rose was a \\"very, very brave thing for her to do,\\" as she had to play her role without ever using her eyes. Citing the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the base number of gems Tom gets for spending 250 Tom spends 250 and the game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent.

The poems should not have any reference to the field of Aram (dealing of love and romance). Ambikapathi begins the test in the King's court with a Kadavul Vaazhthu (invocation to God). Amaravathi who is keeping the count, mistakes the invocation as a poem and counts it as poem number one. When he has sung only ninety nine Puram poems, she thinks he has completed the task and signals him that hundred poems have been sung. Declaring victory, Ambikapathy sings of his love for her and thus fails the test. He is executed by the king.[3] The answer is:","output":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"instruction":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

Such a task would involve observing, predicting, and evaluating physical phenomena while applying the principles of mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and other branches of physics. One such example of a task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning is designing and constructing a Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is a complex, deliberately over-engineered contraption that accomplishes a simple task, typically including a series of chain reactions, collisions, and potential/kinetic energy transfers. To successfully complete this task, a person would need to: 1. Understand the basic principles of physics: This includes knowledge of concepts such as force, motion, energy, gravity, friction, and momentum, as well as familiarity with the Laws of Motion and the principles of energy conservation. 2. Define the goal: Clearly state the ultimate objective of the Rube Goldberg machine, such as ringing a bell or popping a balloon. This will help guide the design and construction process. 3. Identify components and materials: Determine which objects or materials will be used in the machine, such as balls, ramps, levers, pulleys, springs, dominoes, or other household objects. This requires an understanding of their physical properties and potential uses. 4. Design the machine: Develop a blueprint that shows how each component or material will work together to move energy through the system and ultimately achieve the goal. This may involve sketching several iterations or making modifications as new ideas are tested. 5. Apply physical reasoning during construction: As the machine is being built, continually assess the functionality of each component and its ability to transfer energy or motion to the next stage. This may require making adjustments to the initial design to account for factors such as friction, material weights, and degrees of freedom. 6. Test and troubleshoot: Once the machine is fully assembled, run tests to identify any issues and make necessary adjustments. This may involve optimizing the timing of each reaction, replacing components that are not performing as expected, or reevaluating the overall design. Physical reasoning will be instrumental in evaluating the performance of the machine and making improvements when necessary. 7. Evaluate efficiency and success: Assess how well the Rube Goldberg machine achieves the desired outcome in the most efficient and reliable manner possible. This can be subjective, but a strong understanding of the physical principles involved will help determine if the machine is successful or if further refinements are needed. Overall, creating a Rube Goldberg machine requires a deep understanding of the principles and concepts in physics, as well as strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills. This task provides a comprehensive test of someone's ability to perform physical reasoning by requiring them to apply their knowledge of physics to manipulate objects, analyze systems, and predict outcomes in a complex, real-world scenario."},{"instruction":"Student: Premise: \\"A older man with gray hair and wearing a black jacket is standing with several other men around a red car.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Several men are standing around a red car.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?.

If the Indian government has decided to demonetise 500 and 1000 rupee notes, why are they bringing back new 500 and 2000 Rs notes? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The Indian government's decision to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 notes can be attributed to several reasons. Though these questions do not have the same meaning, they are closely related. I will address each question separately and explain their connections. 1. Why did the Indian government demolish ₹500 and ₹1000 notes? There were multiple key objectives behind the Indian government's decision to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in November 2016: a) Tackling black money: The move was aimed at curbing the circulation of black money (undisclosed and unaccounted income) and counterfeit currency. A significant portion of black money was held in the form of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, and by invalidating these denominations overnight, the government intended to bring this illicit wealth under the purview of the formal economy. b) Digitization and financial inclusion: By banning high-value currency notes, the government sought to encourage the adoption of digital payment methods and promote financial inclusion. The temporary cash crunch that followed demonetization compelled people to explore alternative payment methods like bank transfers and mobile wallets, thereby boosting their overall usage. c) Counter-terrorism efforts: Banning high-denomination notes was also an attempt to disrupt financing channels for illegal activities and terrorist organizations. The government aimed at restricting the cash flow to these organizations by eliminating counterfeit currency from the financial system. 2. If the Indian government has decided to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, why are they bringing back new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes? Although the government banned the older ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, it introduced new ₹500 and ₹2000 currency notes for several reasons: a) Maintaining cash liquidity: Completely abolishing high-denomination notes would have drastically impacted daily economic activities. Reintroducing ₹500 and an even higher denomination (₹2000) helped the government maintain liquidity in the system while they took steps to promote financial inclusion and digitization. b) Improved security features: The new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes were equipped with enhanced security features to curb counterfeiting. Some of these features include color-changing ink, intaglio printing, see-through registration marks, and micro-lettering. c) Boosting public confidence: Introducing new currency notes served as a measure to restore public confidence in the banking system and the economy. It demonstrated that the government was committed to addressing critical issues like black money and that they were undertaking steps to stabilize the cash flow in the country. In summary, while the question on why the Indian government demolished ₹500 and ₹1000 notes is related to the objectives of demonetization, the question about the introduction of new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes pertains to the government's strategy and efforts to continue addressing the aforementioned objectives while ensuring the stability and functionality of the economy."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative?

The university consistently secures significant funding to support its research projects, allowing its scholars and researchers to push the boundaries of knowledge. Among the various funding sources, two major sponsors stand out: the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). This article explores which of these two entities has granted the largest amount of money to MIT for sponsored research. The United States Department of Defense: The United States Department of Defense plays a crucial role in maintaining the country's national security by providing military forces and funding necessary to deter and overcome potential adversaries. In addition to its core function, the Department of Defense also actively invests in cutting-edge research aimed at improving its capabilities, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, communication, and advanced materials. MIT is considered one of the premier research institutions for exploring these areas, resulting in a strong partnership with the Department of Defense. The DoD invests heavily in MIT's innovative research as it recognizes the potential of these ventures in addressing national security threats and driving technological advancements. The presence of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center, further emphasizes the strong ties between MIT and the DoD. The National Science Foundation: The National Science Foundation is an independent agency of the United States government that focuses primarily on funding academic research in the fields of science and engineering. NSF aims to advance the nation's scientific capabilities by funding groundbreaking research initiatives that have the potential to lead to breakthroughs and drive innovation. MIT has long been a beneficiary of NSF funding, as the institution has a diverse portfolio of research interests that align with the agency's objectives. Ranging from fundamental science disciplines such as physics and chemistry to engineering fields such as robotics and renewable energy, MIT researchers have been successful in securing the necessary sponsorship from NSF to advance their projects. Conclusion: Who has granted more? After delving into the financial relationships between MIT and these two sponsors, it becomes evident that both the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation have contributed significantly to MIT's sponsored research efforts. As for the main question, recent financial reports suggest that the United States Department of Defense outpaces the National Science Foundation when it comes to financial contributions to MIT. The MIT Fiscal Year 2021 financial report indicates that the Department of Defense provided 614 million for sponsored research in that time frame, while the National Science Foundation funded MIT with 191 million. Hence, in the context of the question at hand, the United States Department of Defense clearly granted MIT a larger amount for sponsored research than the NSF. In conclusion, while both sponsors have provided substantial funding to MIT over the years, the United States Department of Defense currently stands as the top contributor of sponsored research funds to the institute. Both the DoD and the NSF remain committed to advancing the pace of discovery and innovation in their respective areas of interest, and MIT has played a pivotal role in benefiting from and contributing to those efforts."},{"instruction":"He needed to get ice to have a refreshing drink, the what was stuck on only hot mode?

Inside, the grains will be protected from heat and light, both of which can cause them to spoil prematurely. Best of all, almost any type of storage container can easily go into the fridge, provided it’s the right size. Whenever possible, the refrigerator should be your first choice for putting away flaxseed. Refrigerated flaxseed has the potential to last 6 whole months longer than flaxseed stored at room temperature. If refrigerator space is limited, just look a few feet higher. Stashing your flaxseed in the freezer is a wise move if you know you’re not going to get around to using it for a while, or you prefer to buy it in bulk. It will stay good for a year or longer past its listed expiration date, since the surrounding temperature is so low. There’s no need to thaw frozen flaxseed prior to grinding it or adding it to food. Hold off on processing your whole flaxseed until you’re ready to sprinkle some into a green smoothie or bowl or oats. Then, measure out the desired amount and return the rest to the pantry or refrigerator. It may be a little tedious, but it will greatly increase the lifespan of your supply. Freezing ground flaxseed may keep it fresh for as long as 3 months. Even so, the sooner you put it to use, the better. Anytime you’re grinding flaxseed, add it to your food or transfer it to its intended storage container without delay. The longer it remains out, the more likely it is to take on moisture. Even relatively dry air can kick off oxidation and lead to spoilage. Avoid grinding or opening a container of ground flaxseed in a steamy kitchen. Always reseal your storage container and return it to the refrigerator or freezer as soon as you’re finished portioning. When flaxseed spoils, the fatty acids deteriorate, causing it to take on a rancid odor. Open up the container and give the flaxseed a whiff to make sure it’s okay to eat. If it smells questionable, it’s probably best to throw it away and spring for a new batch. By contrast, fresh flaxseed will have a mild, nutty scent. Consuming spoiled flaxseed isn’t dangerous, but it may have an unpleasant taste or cause minor digestive issues. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the importance of preserving flaxseed in order to maintain its freshness and prolong its shelf life. It recommends storing freshly-opened flaxseed in a refrigerator or freezer to protect it from heat and light, which can cause spoilage. Refrigerated flaxseed can last up to 6 months longer than when stored at room temperature, while frozen flaxseed can stay good for a year or longer. It is advised to grind flaxseed only when needed, store it in a sealed container, and avoid exposing it to moisture. The freshness of flaxseed can be determined by its mild, nutty scent, while a rancid odor indicates spoilage."},{"instruction":"it’s one common feeling that teeth whitening, in particular those utilised by superstars are very highly-priced and complicated to implement.

After the race was called for Jones, the Republican refused to concede, saying he believed the margin of victory could fall below the 0.5% needed to trigger a recount, the Washington Post reports. \\"Realize that when the vote is this close that it’s not over,\\" he said. \\"We also know that God is always in control.\\" He told supporters they need to \\"wait on God and let this whole process play out.\\" The AP reports that with all precincts reporting, Jones has a lead of 1.5%, but counties will be required to tally all write-in votes if authorities determine they outnumber the difference between Jones and Moore. \\"Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory,\\" Trump tweeted. \\"The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.\\" At his victory rally, Jones said he was overwhelmed by the upset win and called for national unity. \\"I have always believed that the people of Alabama have more in common than divides us,\\" he said. \\"We have shown the country the way that we can be.\\" He urged Senate lawmakers to come together and fund the Children's Health Insurance Program before he is sworn in. The Alabama Republican Party, meanwhile, said it would not support Moore's push for a recount. Expand this summary.","output":"In December 2017, following the win of Doug Jones of the Democratic party in the Alabama Senate election, his rival and Republican candidate, Roy Moore, declined to accept the election results. The race was officially called in favor of Jones, marking a major upset in Alabama politics which typically favors Republican candidates. However, Moore's refusal to concede came as he believed that the narrow margin of victory, could fall below the 0.5% required to trigger an official recount, as reported by the Washington Post. Moore addressed his supporters in the aftermath of the election results saying, \\"Realize that when the vote is this close that it's not over.\\" His statement reflected a staunch resolve to contest the results further hinting at possible legal action. Displaying a strong leaning on his religious beliefs, Moore continued, \\"We also know that God is always in control.\\" He encouraged his followers to bide their time and allow the situation to unfold saying that they needed to \\"wait on God and let this whole process play out.\\" The Associated Press reported that after the tally from all the precincts, Jones held a lead of 1.5%. According to electoral rules, all counties are required to count all the write-in votes if it's determined that the number of such votes outweighs the difference between the leading and trailing candidate. In this scenario, the write-in votes exceeded the margin between Jones and Moore, thus warranting a recount. In contrast to Moore, then-President Donald Trump accepted and publicly acknowledged Jones's victory, stating \\"Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory.\\" He opined that write-in votes had played a significant role in deciding the results. However, Trump maintained his characteristic optimism for his party, saying \\"a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.\\" At his victory rally, Jones expressed his gratitude and talked about the unexpected nature of his win, calling it an \\"overwhelm.\\" He reached out to his counterparts in the Senate and urged them to put aside their political differences and work together, mainly focusing on the funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program before he took office. His message emphasized on the unity of the nation and the potential of Alabama to show the country a path of mutual understanding and commonality. Jones's final words were, \\"I have always believed that the people of Alabama have more in common than divides us. We have shown the country the way that we can be.\\" On the other hand, Moore's pursuit of a recount received no support from the Alabama Republican Party. The party's decision did not side with Moore's refusal to concede adding another setback for the former candidate. In an already entangled situation, this stance from the party added another level of complexity to the post-election dynamics in Alabama. The entire episode highlighted the high-stakes and the charged political climate of the US Senate elections and its aftermath."},{"instruction":"If \\"Kids lined up and surrounded by people.\\", does this mean that \\"Kids lined up about to get shot by a firing squad.\\"?","output":"Based solely on the phrase \\"Kids lined up and surrounded by people,\\" it is not possible to definitively conclude that the scenario you provided (“Kids lined up about to get shot by a firing squad.”) is what is taking place. The statement is too vague, and several possible interpretations and scenarios might fit the given description. Let's consider some alternative scenarios: 1. Kids participating in a talent show: The children might be lining up and surrounded by their families, friends, and teachers who are eagerly waiting to watch their performances. 2. Children receiving awards or prizes: They could be lining up to receive certificates, medals, or other tokens of appreciation for their achievements in academics, sports, or arts, while parents and educators cheer them on. 3. Students getting ready for a class photo: The kids might be lining up in an orderly manner while teachers and staff help to get them into position for a group shot. 4. Kids participating in a sports event or competition: The children might be lining up before a race, preparing for a relay, or taking part in another type of sports event, with parents, coaches, and spectators looking on. 5. Children waiting for a school bus or to enter a venue: They might be standing in a line as they wait to board the bus for a field trip, or getting ready to enter a location for an event or activity, supervised by teachers or other adults. As one can infer from these examples, there are numerous other plausible and innocent scenarios in which kids may line up and be surrounded by people, aside from the extreme and morbid situation of facing a firing squad. It is essential to have more context and specifics to accurately determine the situation and the meaning behind the phrase.

Questions: The mascot gathered the children around the campfire, he then began to what them? Options: - go to movies - read to - imagine - eat smores - play games The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is: read to. This option is most in line with common sense, as it creates a fitting scenario wherein the mascot gathers children around the campfire to engage in a storytelling session. In this context, it makes the most sense for the mascot to read to the children, as it creates an appropriate setting and atmosphere for sharing stories. A campfire setting is often associated with storytelling and creating a sense of camaraderie and bonding among the attendees. The mascot, in this case, serves as the main storyteller, who brings the children together to share knowledge, teach them valuable lessons, or ignite their imaginations through the power of narrative. The other options, while potentially feasible in different settings, do not fit as well in the context of gathering around a campfire. Going to the movies would require a different setting, like a movie theater or a home with a television, and is therefore not suitable for a campfire gathering. Similarly, having the children engage in imaginative play might not best utilize the mascot's role as an entertainer or teacher. While eating s'mores and playing games could be fitting activities to engage in around a campfire, they are not directly related to the mascot's primary role of entertaining or educating the children. Thus, a long and detailed answer to the question would be: The mascot gathers the children around the campfire in order to read to them, either from a book or by sharing oral stories from memory, in a setting that fosters a sense of bonding, learning, and imagination among the attendees. This experience allows the children to connect with the mascot on a deeper level, learn important life lessons, and leave the event with lasting memories that enrich their personal and social development."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: what does the v mean in court cases?","output":"In court cases, the \\"v\\" stands for \\"versus\\" or \\"against.\\" It is used to denote the parties involved in a legal dispute or lawsuit, indicating the plaintiff (the party bringing the lawsuit) and the defendant (the party being sued). The \\"v\\" often appears abbreviated as \\"v.\\" or \\"vs.\\" in written case citations. The usage of \\"v\\" in court cases is rooted in the Latin term \\"versus,\\" which means \\"against\\" or \\"opposite.\\" This term has been utilized in legal documents for centuries to denote the opposition between two parties in a case. When writing or reading a court case's name, the plaintiff is typically listed first, followed by the \\"v\\" abbreviation, and then the defendant. For example, in the well-known United States court case Brown v. Board of Education, Brown (the plaintiff) brought a lawsuit against the Board of Education (the defendant) regarding racial segregation in public schools. Within different jurisdictions and legal systems, the format of case citations and the usage of \\"v\\" can differ slightly. For instance, in the UK and other Commonwealth nations, it has become customary to use \\"and\\" or \\"&\\" instead of \\"v\\" in criminal cases. The \\"v\\" remains in use for civil lawsuits.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less toxins removed from the blood happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the proposed perturbation - less toxins being removed from the blood - can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver and its processes. Step 1: Less toxins removed from the blood When the liver removes fewer toxins from the blood, the blood may contain higher levels of harmful substances. This can lead to an accumulation of toxins, potentially damaging the liver cells and other parts of the body. Step 2: Effects on blood cleansing and nutrient processing With the liver working less efficiently in toxin removal, it may also have negative impacts on its other functions, including blood cleansing, nutrient processing, and waste removal. The liver might not be able to optimally filter the blood, which may affect the overall health and functioning of the body. Step 3: Effects on bile production and absorption of fats The liver is responsible for producing bile, which helps in absorbing fats into the bloodstream. If the liver is functioning at a reduced capacity, it might produce less bile or less effective bile. This can result in decreased fat absorption, potentially leading to deficiencies in essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Step 4: Effects on glycogen storage The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen to be used as fuel when needed. A liver working less optimally due to decreased toxin removal might store less glycogen or have a more difficult time releasing glycogen as fuel. This can lead to issues with maintaining steady blood sugar levels and energy levels in the body. Overall, the proposed perturbation of the liver removing fewer toxins from the blood can have direct and indirect effects on the liver's functioning. These effects may include reduced blood cleansing, nutrient processing, bile production, and glycogen storage, impacting overall health and vital processes within the body."},{"instruction":"John was studying the history of dinosaurs.

Answer: The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard Mayflower in 1620. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers was none other than the Mayflower. This historic voyage embarked from the port of Southampton, England, in August 1620 with the aim to transport a group of English separatists, later known as the Pilgrim Fathers, to the New World. The Pilgrim Fathers were a group of religious people who sought religious freedom and were fleeing persecution from the Church of England. They believed in attaining a pure state of Christianity and wanted to separate themselves from the Anglican Church, whose practices they disagreed with. The initial plan for the journey was for two ships to sail together from Southampton, with the Mayflower being accompanied by another ship called the Speedwell. However, due to the Speedwell experiencing leaks during the journey, both ships had to return to England twice. Eventually, it was decided that the Mayflower would continue the journey alone, leaving behind some passengers and transporting approximately 102 passengers and roughly 30 crew members. On September 6, 1620, the Mayflower finally departed from Plymouth, England, and set sail on its arduous and momentous journey across the Atlantic Ocean. It took the Mayflower 66 days to cross the treacherous waters of the North Atlantic before arriving at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on November 9, 1620. Upon their arrival, the Pilgrim Fathers drafted the Mayflower Compact, an agreement signed by 41 adult males on board that laid the foundation for the governance and laws in the new Plymouth colony. This document represented the first practical example of democracy and self-government in the English colonies of the New World. The journey and establishment of the Plymouth colony by the Pilgrim Fathers were significant as it marked the beginning of the British colonization of the Americas. The story of the Mayflower and the Pilgrim Fathers also occupies an important place in American history and is often commemorated during the annual Thanksgiving Day celebration. In conclusion, the famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620 was the Mayflower, a vessel that played a critical role in the establishment of the Plymouth colony and showcased the determination of its passengers in seeking religious freedom and a new life in the New World."},{"instruction":"Q: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American teen comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by John Hughes, and co-produced by Tom Jacobson.

Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix.

Despite every hipster prediction otherwise, the company’s user base keeps growing, and nearly a fifth of the time that Americans spend on their smartphones is spent on Facebook. That surpasses the amount of time we spend on any other single service by a wide margin — and beats just about anything else we do on our phones, or perhaps in our lives, period. And yet, when was the last time you swooned over some new feature in Facebook? The two big products that Facebook unveiled last year — Home, an Android lock screen, and Graph Search, a search engine — failed to catch on. And some of the most innovative recent social networking ideas have come from upstarts, which Facebook has either spent huge sums buying (up to 19 billion for WhatsApp, 1 billion for Instagram) or trying and failing to buy (3 billion offered for Snapchat). Photo Every time a new, much-hyped Facebook product blows up on the launchpad, and every time the company pays billions for someone else’s greatest idea, predictions of Facebook’s doom begin to roll in. But Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, is not worried. Facebook’s innovation engine may have stalled lately, but Mr. Zuckerberg has been working on revamping the way the company creates and distributes new services. The effort, which he began discussing this year, is called Creative Labs, and can be summarized in a single word: apps. Lots and lots of apps. “What we’re doing with Creative Labs is basically unbundling the big blue app,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a recent interview at the firm’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. In the past, he said, Facebook was one big thing, a website or mobile app that let you indulge all of your online social needs. Now, on mobile phones especially, Facebook will begin to splinter into many smaller, more narrowly focused services, some of which won’t even carry Facebook’s branding, and may not require a Facebook account to use. The plan is as risky as it is bold, and it will greatly alter how most of Facebook’s billion-plus users experience the service. It could easily backfire by annoying users and perhaps slowing growth. And despite earning rapturous reviews, the first app out of Creative Labs — Paper, an iPhone app that lets users navigate Facebook’s News Feed through a system of touch gestures — has gained few users since it was unveiled in January. Mr. Zuckerberg’s plan isn’t really a surprise. Facebook has long been offering its services in separate apps; it introduced a stand-alone text-message app, Messenger, in 2011. The new plan will accelerate that effort. To use all of Facebook’s features, you may need to install a bunch of different apps that will each prioritize a single function, from browsing the News Feed to sending messages to interacting with groups. Last week, the company began notifying users that it would soon require that they install the stand-alone Messenger app to send Facebook messages. Photo Mr. Zuckerberg said the multi-app strategy is meant to adapt Facebook to the way people use mobile phones, which now account for the bulk of Facebook’s visits and advertising revenue. “In mobile, there’s a big premium on creating single-purpose, first-class experiences,” he said. Because there is so little space on a phone’s screen, apps that promote a single function can have a simpler and more intuitive design, improving the way they work. Single-purpose apps may run more quickly, too. For example, Facebook has found that people get messaging replies 20 percent faster through Messenger than through the Facebook app. But what’s most promising about the multi-app strategy is that it lets Facebook take creative risks. “You’ll see us exploring new areas that we felt we didn’t have the room to do before,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. For software companies, one of the perils of success is becoming shackled to your customers; the more users you have, the harder it is to innovate, because most will be averse to any change. (Microsoft has suffered a version of this.) By filtering its innovations into new apps that lack an established user base, engineers and designers can take creative leaps that may not have worked if they’d simply been adding features to Facebook’s primary app. You can see this thinking at work in Paper. Developers on the project said they they’d been given the freedom to try out new kinds of programming tools and to indulge novel design ideas; they described it as an effort to mimic the ethos of a start-up within Facebook. The result is powerful: Paper looks and feels like no other Facebook app, and it is a pleasure to use — one of the most arresting mobile products that any company, large or small, has put out recently. Still, Creative Labs has its critics, and its success is far from guaranteed. Ted Zoller, the director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina, argues that such a system is doomed because of the lure of start-up money. “If you’re a talented engineer and have a good idea at Facebook, why would you create it while you’re at Facebook and make Mark Zuckerberg richer?” he asked. Photo What’s more, by creating new features outside of its main app, Facebook could be limiting its ability to promote its innovations to its core users. Still, though Paper has been languishing on the app charts, Mr. Zuckerberg said he wasn’t concerned, and was prepared to wait for Paper and other Creative Labs projects to slowly gain an audience. There’s a logic to this view. “You often see that isolating innovative teams from some of the commercial demands of a company — giving them a quarantined, protected status — is one of the better ways to promote innovation,” said Andrew Razeghi, founder of the consulting group StrategyLab. But whether Facebook will manage to eventually turn upstart apps like Paper into something big remains to be seen. The Creative Labs strategy fits with Mr. Zuckerberg’s view that some parts of the mobile Internet are much bigger and more complicated than he had previously thought. He noted that WhatsApp and Facebook’s Messenger were nominally identical — both are used to send texts — but that after studying both products’ huge user bases, Facebook found they were being used by different people for different purposes. “I think we basically saw that the messaging space is bigger than we’d initially realized,” he said. This idea explains Facebook’s increasing appetite for acquisitions. On a huge mobile web, services like WhatsApp and Instagram can benefit from Facebook’s resources while maintaining their own communities and, crucially, not cannibalizing Facebook’s own user base. It also explains Facebook’s willingness to be looser with its own branding. “We went out of our way to just call it Paper, not Facebook Paper,” Mr. Zuckerberg said of the new app. “One of the things that we’re trying to do with Creative Labs and all our experiences is explore things that aren’t all tied to Facebook identity.” If the new plan succeeds, then, one day large swaths of Facebook may not look like Facebook — and may not even bear the name Facebook. It will be everywhere, but you may not know it. ||||| Most of us have had Facebook accounts for the past few years, if not a decade. But time and bloat have turned once-beloved font of nostalgia into an onslaught of faux-sentimental sludge from strangers. So as Facebook stands poised to break itself into a bunch of different apps, we say to you: Screw it. It's time to start fresh. When Facebook opened to the public in 2006, it made a convincing case that it could live up to its moniker. Enough people you cared about joined in to make it an effective social planner, phone book, and photo album all wrapped in a singular, virtual package. It was, for all intents and purposes, the perfect social network. But then it kept growing. Advertisement Facebook added Marketplace, chats, Pages, friends lists, Newsfeed, @replies, Timeline—the list goes on and on. Some additions worked, many didn't, but the single truth that Facebook eventually grew too big for its own, and more importantly our, good. As Ellis Hamburger pointed out at the Verge earlier this week, Facebook's become too big to ever feel small again. So in an attempt to to chase the trend of more intimate, single-serving social media apps, Zuck and co. want to retrofit the Facebook we know and (still kind of a little bit) love into the neat, tiny, separate packages that represent everything Facebook is not. The process has already started with Messages, a bedrock feature that's about to be jettisoned from the main Facebook app into a standalone replacement. And that's just the beginning. In a recent NYT interview, Zuck made loud and clear about his intention to start \\"unbundling the big blue app.\\" Or maybe that should be \\"continue.\\" There are already separate apps for Facebook camera and Pages; it's only a matter of time before Facebook starts kicking those and other major functions out of the main Facebook app, forcing users into a bizarre approximation of the niche social apps it so desperately wants to emulate. Instead of going to Facebook, you'll go to your phone's Facebook folder and choose from among your five or six hyper-specialized options. Advertisement In and of itself that's more of an inconvenience than a reason to leave. But then you remember that just because your Facebook apps have gone micro, your friend list is just as bloated as ever. You might be focusing on just photos, but you're still sharing them with the same weirdos you've picked up over the years breathing down your neck at every turn. If we're going to be forced into using these specialized social media apps whether we like it or not, we might as well start over. Friend lists created from scratch. Singular apps that excel at singular functions. A brave new social world, filled with people you actually like, sharing only the things you care about. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Here's your new social diet. The idea of leaving Facebook might make you uneasy, but the Facebook you know is going to leave you whether you like it or not. So we might as well move on to something better, brighter, and wholly devoid of all our lukewarm acquaintances and friends' cousins' ex-boyfriends. Because try as Facebook might to squeeze itself into a world of super specialized tiny containers, the made-to-fit services do it better. More importantly, they give us what everyone deserves: a fresh start. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Facebook has become a strong business with many users, but in order to keep growing, they are planning to change their approach. They want to create a lot of smaller apps that focus on specific things, like sending messages or looking at photos, instead of having one big app that does everything. This way, they can try new ideas and make it easier for people to use their services on their smartphones, which is where most people use Facebook now. However, it's uncertain if this plan will work or if it will annoy users and slow down growth."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"Two casually dressed men sit down and enjoy a beer and food outdoors.\\" that \\"They have nothing to eat.\\"?

While these elements can indeed influence the course of history, they're not the crux of what drives historical change, especially in the context of human history. The reasons for historical change are far more intricate and multifaceted, encompassing various social, political, technological, economical, and cultural factors among others. Social changes, such as shifts in societal structures, population dynamics, and cultural norms, play a significant role in driving historical change. For instance, the abolition of slavery in many regions came about due to societal changes in attitudes towards equality and human rights. Political changes too have their repercussions. The rise and fall of different regimes, wars, and revolutions have led to significant redirections in history. For instance, the French Revolution in the late 18th century not only transformed France, but also had profound effects on the course of modern history, spreading the ideals of liberty and democracy. Technological advancement is another reason for historical change. From the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural ones enabled by advancements in farming technology, to the Industrial Revolution driven by mechanisation, technology has historically been a potent driver of change. Economic factors also play a crucial part in shaping history. Economic depressions, growth, and recessions, the development of trade routes, and the discovery of new resources can drastically alter societal structures and drive history in new directions. The discovery of the New World, for example, redirected the economic focus of Europe and brought about significant historical change. Ultimately, the reasons for historical change are inextricably interconnected, with changes in one area often triggering changes in others. Hence, while cosmic, geologic, and organic history can influence human history, they do not encompass the complexity of reasons behind historical change."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"An older asian couple walking a collie on a cool day.\\" can we conclude that \\"Some people are walking a large cat.\\"?

There are several reasons due to which you may lose files from HFSX volumes. First, file system corruption can occur, causing the files to become inaccessible or lost. This can happen due to power outages, software conflicts, or hardware failures that interfere with the proper functioning of the file system. In these cases, a thorough disk check and repair using utilities such as Apple's Disk Utility can help address the corruption. Second, accidental deletion of files is another common reason for losing files from an HFSX volume. Users might accidentally delete crucial files or folders, which can then be difficult to recover. While there are file recovery tools available, they may not always be able to restore lost files completely, especially if the deleted files have been overwritten by new data. Third, virus or malware attacks can lead to the loss of files from HFSX volumes. Some malicious software can infiltrate the system and wreak havoc on the file system by deleting files or corrupting the data stored on the volume. Users can protect their systems by using robust antivirus and anti-malware programs and keeping them updated regularly. Fourth, human errors such as improper handling or storage of the data can also lead to file loss from HFSX volumes. For instance, ejecting an external drive without safely unmounting it first, or disconnecting a device while it is still in use, can cause data loss. Moreover, physical damage to the storage medium, such as scratches on a CD or hard drive platter, can render the data unreadable. Fifth, software issues may result in the loss of files from HFSX volumes. Sometimes software applications can crash or encounter errors that may lead to data corruption or loss. Users should ensure their software programs are up-to-date and compatible with their devices to prevent such issues from occurring. Lastly, hardware failure, such as a hard drive crash or a faulty memory card, can cause files to disappear from HFSX volumes. Regularly backing up data and maintaining the hardware can help mitigate such risks and ensure that files remain safe and intact. In conclusion, while HFSX volumes offer advanced file management capabilities, they are not immune to various issues that can cause the loss of files. To minimize the risk of data loss, users should practice good file management habits, keep their systems up-to-date and secure, and regularly back up their files."},{"instruction":"TORONTO (Reuters) - Nortel Networks Corp. &lt;A HREF=\\"http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=NT.TO target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote\\"&gt;NT.TO&lt;/A&gt; expects to report lower 2004 third-quarter revenues compared to the second quarter, North America's largest maker of telecom equipment said in a market update required by regulators on Thursday.

He was one of the most successful road cyclists of the 1980s, and one of the finest classics riders of all time. From turning professional in 1977 until his retirement in 1994, he won nine monument classics, and 193 professional races in total. He won Paris- Kelly returned in April to the 1988 Vuelta a Espana which started on the rugged mountainous island of Tenerife where his team struggled in the second stage, losing the influential rider Thomas Wegmuller to dysentery and losing further time in the time-trial around Las Palmas. However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Jorge Dominguez, the BH teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino. After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team Fagor-MBK to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo. He then finished fourth behind stage-winner Fabio Parra and Anselmo Fuerte on stage 13 to the ski-station at Cerler, cutting a minute and a half into Cubino's lead. From this stage, Fuerte had moved into second overall and later took the jersey from Cubino on the 16th stage to Albacete when the leader got caught on the wrong side of a split caused by cross-winds. Kelly maintained the gap between himself and Fuerte and started the time trial on the second last day 21 seconds behind. Confident that he could overhaul the leader, he \\"put it in a big gear and gave it everything\\". He took the leader's amarillo jersey, beating Fuerte by almost two minutes.

If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, are they closer or farther? David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Hint: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. A:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph, if the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, they are likely farther apart. Step 1: Identify the charges and their interactions. In this case, both charge A and charge B are negative charges. Negative charges repel each other. Step 2: Understand the relationship between potential energy and the position of charged particles. When two negatively charged particles are close together, they have a higher potential energy due to the repulsion between them. Step 3: Apply the hint about the decrease in potential energy. If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, it means they are moving into a position where they have lower potential energy. Step 4: Conclude the relationship between distance and potential energy. Since the potential energy decreases, this indicates that the two charges have moved apart, making them farther from each other. This corresponds to the natural tendency of electric charges to move from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy, such as in the example of water falling over a dam due to gravity."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"People going up an escalator in the mall.\\" is it true that \\"A crowd by some stairs.\\"? A step-by-step solution is:","output":"1. Begin by analyzing the original sentence: \\"People going up an escalator in the mall.\\" - This sentence describes a group of individuals moving up on an escalator inside a shopping mall. 2. Next, analyze the statement in question: \\"A crowd by some stairs.\\" - This statement describes a large group of people standing near a set of stairs. 3. Now, compare the two situations: - In the original sentence, we have people going up an escalator, which is a mechanized set of stairs. - In the second statement, we have a group of people near some stairs but not necessarily using them. 4. From the comparison, we can see that there are similarities and differences between the two statements: - Similarities: Both situations mention people and stairs (as escalators are mechanized stairs). - Differences: In the original sentence, we don't know if the group of people is a crowd (a large group), and they're actively going up the escalator. In the second statement, we have a crowd, but they are not specifically moving up the stairs. 5.

During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese ideology of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet.

Philip's predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself king of France. The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adèle of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed \\"Dieudonné\\" \\"God-given\\" because he was the first son of Louis VII, born late in his father's life. Philip was given the nickname \\"Augustus\\" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the Crown lands of France so remarkably. - The House of Capet or the Direct Capetians, also called the House of France (\\"la maison de France\\"), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - Louis VIII the Lion ( 5 September 1187 -- 8 November 1226 ) was a King of France from the House of Capet who reigned from 1223 to 1226 . He also claimed the title King of England from 1216 to 1217 . Louis VIII was born in Paris , the son of King Philip II of France and Isabelle of Hainaut , from whom he inherited the County of Artois . While Louis VIII only briefly reigned as king of France , he was an active leader in his years as crown prince . During the First Barons ' War of 1215 - 17 against King John of England , his military prowess earned him the epithet the Lion . After his victory at the Battle of Roche - au - Moine in 1214 , he invaded southern England and was proclaimed \`\` King of England '' by rebellious barons in London on the 2 June 1216 . He was never crowned , however , and renounced his claim after being excommunicated and repelled . In 1217 , Louis started the conquest of Guyenne , leaving only a small region around Bordeaux to Henry III of England . Louis 's short reign was marked by an intervention using royal forces into the Albigensian Crusade in southern France that decisively moved the conflict towards a conclusion . He died in 1226 and was succeeded by his son Louis IX. What entity does 'louis viii of france' has the relation 'noble family' with?

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Sure, here is how I would translate this sentence step by step: Firstly, let's break the sentence down into smaller parts: 1. \\"Скрытую пищевую аллергию\\" - This is the subject phrase. 'Скрытую' is a feminine form of the adjective 'скрытый', which means 'hidden' or 'latent'. 'Пищевую аллергию' translates to 'food allergy'. 2. \\"обнаружили уже после \\" - This part forms a transition, it includes a verb and an adverb. 'Обнаружили' is the past plural form of the verb 'обнаружить', which means 'discovered' or 'detected'. 'уже после' translates to 'already after'. 3. \\"открытия иммуноглобулинов класса Е - IgE.\\" - This is the final part of the sentence. 'Открытия' is the genitive case of the noun 'открытие', which means 'opening' or 'discovery'. 'иммуноглобулинов класса Е' translates to 'class E immunoglobulins', and 'IgE' is the abbreviation. Now we can combining these parts together: \\"The latent food allergy was detected only after the discovery of class E immunoglobulins - IgE.\\" In the translation, I decided to use the term \\"latent\\" instead of \\"hidden\\" for 'скрытую' to make it sound more medical. The phrase \\"was detected only after the\\" seemed to be the most suitable translation for 'обнаружили уже после' to fit the sentence context in English."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success \\"was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, is referring to the supposition that in industrialized areas, humans are killing more rats and mice. If this occurs, it may have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. Direct effects: 1. Reduced prey availability: As humans kill more rats and mice in industrialized areas, the number of potential prey for owls is reduced. Consequently, it becomes more challenging for owls to find and hunt their preferred food sources, resulting in the need for them to broaden their hunting range or adapt to new prey species. 2. Changes in hunting habits: The reduction in small mammal populations may force owls to change their hunting habits in response to the availability of prey. For instance, they might need to spend more time and energy searching for prey, or they could start hunting more frequently during certain times of the day or year when the prey is more abundant. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in prey behavior and distribution: As humans kill rats and mice, the behavior and distribution of these prey species may change. This could lead to a shift in where owls are likely to find prey and a change in the preferred hunting grounds. 2. Ecological interactions: The loss of rats and mice in industrialized areas can have cascading effects on the local ecosystem. For example, it may lead to an increase in the populations of other prey species, which could, in turn, impact the owls' hunting process and prey selection. 3. Environmental factors: Industrialized areas might have other factors that influence the owls' hunting process. For instance, higher levels of pollution, more artificial light, or habitat fragmentation could affect the owls' ability to efficiently hunt for their prey. Overall, the supposed perturbation of increased rat and mouse fatalities in industrialized areas could have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. They may need to adapt their hunting strategies and techniques accordingly or face challenges in finding sufficient prey to maintain their populations."},{"instruction":"The film begins with Brick Bardo ( Tim Thomerson , from ( ( Dollman hitchhiking to get to the town of Pahoota , where he tries to find a girl named Nurse Ginger ( Melissa Behr , who was shrunken to 11 inches in ( ( Bad Channels , to prove to her that she's not alone .

Answer:","output":"The founding of the Colony of Virginia is considered to have been a collective effort. However, Sir Walter Raleigh, King James I of England, and the Virginia Company of London all played essential roles in its establishment. To provide a detailed answer, it is necessary to discuss each of their contributions. 1) Sir Walter Raleigh: Sir Walter Raleigh, an English explorer and writer, is often associated with the early attempts to establish an English colony in North America. Although he did not directly found the Colony of Virginia, he was the one who inspired and paved the way for its establishment. In 1584, Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a royal charter to explore and colonize the New World. He organized several expeditions to explore the eastern coast of North America and named the area Virginia in honor of Elizabeth, the \\"Virgin Queen.\\" His attempts to settle the land, primarily the Roanoke Colony, ended in failure, but his endeavours sparked the interest of other Englishmen in exploring and colonizing the New World. 2) King James I of England: King James I succeeded Queen Elizabeth I in 1603 and continued to support the exploration and colonization of the New World. Under his reign, a group of English businessmen and investors, known as the Virginia Company, was granted a royal charter in 1606. This charter authorized the company to establish colonies in the region that Raleigh had previously explored and named Virginia. King James I's primary purpose in supporting the colonization of Virginia was to create a new source of revenue for England, expand trade routes, and establish a base for opposing hostile powers, such as Spain. 3) The Virginia Company of London: The Virginia Company of London played a crucial role in founding the Colony of Virginia. This joint-stock company was formed by a group of investors who shared the costs and potential risks of colonizing North America in return for a share in the expected profits. Authorized by King James I's royal charter, the Virginia Company sent a group of 104 men and boys to establish a permanent English settlement in North America. In December 1606, the settlers embarked on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean, eventually reaching the shores of what is now known as Virginia in April 1607. The colonists, under the leadership of Captain Christopher Newport, established the first permanent English settlement in North America, called Jamestown, on May 14, 1607. They faced numerous challenges, including disease, hostile relations with the area’s indigenous people, and a lack of provisions. Despite these difficulties, Jamestown managed to survive and grow, eventually becoming the capital of the Virginia Colony until 1699. In conclusion, while Sir Walter Raleigh laid the groundwork for the Colony of Virginia through his exploration efforts and initial colonization attempts, it was ultimately King James I of England and the Virginia Company of London that successfully established the first permanent English settlement in North America. The collaborative efforts of these individuals and organizations led to the founding of the Colony of Virginia, which played a significant role in the early history of the United States."},{"instruction":"This task is about translating a given English language sentence to French.

For example, a tongue can be used for seeing. The brain, as we know, is a complex organ . Even when part of it is hurt, it will try to carry out the same function by sending the function to another area of the brain. A college student was asked to take part in an experiment. In the experiment, his eyes were covered with a small video camera. The camera was connected to a long plastic line which went into his mouth. A computer would change the video's picture. The picture would travel through the plastic line as an electric current , reaching the electrodes inside the student's mouth. The scientist would roll a ball towards his right side, left side, or centre, and the student would have to catch it. When the scientist rolled the ball, pain passed over the student's tongue.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more trees chopped down happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process of nest building by birds is greatly influenced by the availability of suitable trees and other resources. It is an important part of the overall survival and reproductive success of birds. If we consider a scenario where more trees are chopped down, this perturbation can significantly affect the birds' nesting behavior and the construction of MORE/LARGER nests. The potential direct or indirect effects of this perturbation on the process can be analyzed as follows: Direct Effects: 1. Reduced availability of nesting sites: Since the very first step of the process is the bird selecting a tree, the chopping down of trees will directly impact their ability to choose suitable nesting sites. This can force birds to build nests in less desirable locations, which may not provide adequate support, shelter, or protection. 2. Scarcity of building materials: The chopping down of trees also affects the availability of resources like twigs and leaves needed for nest construction. This could lead to birds struggling to find the necessary materials, making it difficult for them to build larger and more elaborate nests. 3. Increased competition for resources: The reduction in available trees and nesting materials can lead to increased competition among birds for these resources. This competitive environment can make it more challenging for birds to secure enough materials to build larger nests, potentially affecting their reproductive success. Indirect Effects: 1. Changes in species distribution and behaviors: The loss of trees can lead to changes in the distribution of bird species and their behaviors. Birds that rely heavily on specific trees for nesting may be forced to use alternative nesting sites, which could potentially lead to more inter-species interaction and competition for resources. 2. Impacts on other ecosystem components: The chopping down of trees can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. As trees provide shelter and resources for other organisms, their removal can create imbalances in food chains and ecological interactions. Consequently, this could indirectly affect the availability of food and nesting materials for birds. 3. Altered environmental factors: The removal of trees can significantly alter microclimates, exposing birds to harsher environmental conditions. This could make it more challenging for birds to build nests that can withstand these conditions, leading to the construction of smaller or less sturdy nests. Overall, both the direct and indirect effects of the perturbation (chopping down trees) have the potential to considerably impact the process of nest-building by birds. The reduction in suitable nesting sites, scarcity of building materials, and harsher environmental conditions can pose challenges for birds to construct larger and more elaborate nests. Furthermore, these conditions can also influence reproductive success and survival rates, highlighting the vital importance of preserving tree populations for the well-being and sustenance of birds and other organisms that rely on them."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I read the comments for these speakers before I bought them.

Prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is unable to use DNA evidence (which had been contaminated by police handling) to securely convict both accused, leading to a possibility that he might lose the case should he support Shelton. Unwilling to take a chance on lowering his 96% conviction rate, he chooses to make a deal with Darby (the actual murderer), letting him plead guilty to a lesser charge, in return for testifying against Ames. Ames is falsely found guilty of masterminding the break-in and personally committing both murders and is sentenced to death. Shelton feels betrayed by Rice's actions, as he had pleaded with him not to make the deal and to at least try to convict both of them, and because he chose to release the actual killer. Despite this, Nick reasons that some justice is better than no justice at all. Darby serves his shortened sentence and is released just a few years later.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the mushroom life cycle is the formation of a new fruiting body, known as a mushroom or toadstool, which emerges from the soil or growing medium. This occurs after the mycelium, a network of thread-like structures formed by the germinating spores, has successfully colonized the substrate and absorbed necessary nutrients. The mycelium forms a dense mass called a primordium, which then develops into a fully mature fruiting body. During the maturation of the fruiting body, cells differentiate into various structures such as the cap, gills, or pores, and the stalk. Once the mushroom reaches an appropriate size and stage of development, it releases its spores through the process of sporulation, which are then dispersed into the environment, carried by the wind or other means. This helps ensure the continuation of the mushroom's life cycle and the propagation of the species. This entire process is influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and availability of nutrients. The fruiting bodies will continue to grow and develop until they have depleted available resources or are no longer viable due to external conditions. After this point, the mushroom will either decay or be consumed by other organisms, returning nutrients to the environment and ultimately allowing for the growth of new generations of mushrooms."},{"instruction":"Q: What substances, which are distinct from acids and bases, form when ions form ionic bonds? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.

Demonstrators clash with police Monday even before the official march begins. A police officer was found guilty in October of culpable homicide.","output":"Title: Remembering Alexis Grigoropoulos and the Events Around His Life Once upon a time, in December 2008, there was a young boy named Alexis Grigoropoulos who was just 15 years old. Sadly, a very sad thing happened to him. While he was out one night, a police bullet hit him, and he passed away. People were very upset about this and wanted to show how much they cared about Alexis and what happened to him. They decided to hold big demonstrations, which are like parades with lots of people and signs. These demonstrations happened to remember Alexis and let others know that what happened was not okay. On a Monday, some people came together to have another big demonstration. But before the official march could begin, a few people in the crowd became angry and started to clash with police. Clashing means that they were fighting or arguing with each other. This made the situation very scary and not safe. In October, after investigating what happened to Alexis, the police officer who fired the bullet that hit him was found guilty of something called \\"culpable homicide.\\" That means the officer should have been more careful and that he did something wrong, even though he might not have meant to do it on purpose. This story about Alexis Grigoropoulos reminds us that sometimes bad things can happen, and people might get upset and want to make their voices heard. And even when people make mistakes, it's important to learn from them, help others, and try our best to do the right thing."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the subject line \\"KC \\".","output":"Subject: KC Hi [Recipient's Name], I hope you are feeling happy and healthy today!

The length of the cable is good: This statement is positive, as the reviewer is satisfied with the length. 2. Connectors between joints work ok: The reviewer seems to have mixed views here. They think the connectors are working, but they are not extremely satisfied. This statement can be considered neutral. 3. Water pressure issue: The reviewer points out a negative aspect of the product. When the water pressure is high, the connectors can disconnect. This is a problem that may affect the overall performance of the product. 4. Solution with ziptie: Although the reviewer experiences issues with the connectors, they also provide a solution by suggesting using a ziptie to tighten the joints. This implies that the issue can be resolved.

It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère, Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951.

Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given review, it is quite unlikely that the user would recommend this product to others. The reviewer makes a few critical observations, which indicate their dissatisfaction with the product. Firstly, they mention that the filter produces intense flares, which is generally considered a negative aspect in photography or videography as it can lead to a decrease in image quality. Furthermore, the reviewer states that the filter's primary function is to protect the lens, implying that it fails to effectively serve other purposes that a user might expect from a high-quality filter, such as reducing glare, enhancing color contrast, or improving overall image quality. The user also advises potential buyers to invest in a \\"nice coated filter\\" instead, as they believe it would be a more intelligent choice in the long run. This suggestion implies that the user regrets their own decision to purchase the product and wants to prevent others from making the same mistake. Lastly, the reviewer explicitly requests others not to waste their money on the product, as they themselves feel that they have wasted their money by purchasing it. This statement leaves no doubt that the user is not at all satisfied with the product and would not recommend it to others.

Plot title: Men in Black 3 Movie plot: The Men in Black are a secret law-enforcement agency that is responsible for policing the extraterrestrial life hidden on Earth, as well as protecting the world from any aliens who attempt to destroy/invade the planet.The film begins on LunarMax, a MiB prison situated on the moon. A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further. That night, as K waits for Boris with a gun in his hand, he suddenly vanishes...The next morning, J discovers that he has a new partner, the liberated Agent AA, and that K has been dead for forty years (having been killed by Boris the Animal on 16th July 1969). O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for). At this point a Boglodite armada appears; J learns that there was nothing to hold them at bay, with no K to deploy the ArcNet. He theorizes that Boris went back in time to 1969... My question: Why did K kill Boris? A:","output":"In the movie plot provided, Agent K did not kill Boris. K had arrested and imprisoned Boris in the past, and Boris escapes from the LunarMax prison to rewrite history and take revenge on Agent K."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In this context, it appears that their personal experience allows them to relate to others who might find themselves in the same situation. This understanding comes from having firsthand experience of what it's like to be the only caregiver present and having to attend to the needs and desires of the children. The concept of being \\"down to one friend\\" who holds a certain position might be a separate issue that the speaker is addressing. It could signify the potential change in their social circle or the priorities they hold as they navigate through life, given that they now have the responsibility of taking care of children. These kinds of experiences can lead people to reassess their relationships and develop a deeper understanding of their own needs and values. On the other hand, it could also imply that the speaker has lost touch with other friends who might have been in the same situation earlier. This could be because their friends' circumstances have changed, or due to the natural ebb and flow of friendships as people go through various stages of life. The speaker also appears to be commenting on the fact that they are currently the only adult at home with the children. This can be an overwhelming situation at times, as it involves being the sole decision-maker and caretaker in the household without the help of another adult. This might be one of the reasons why the speaker can empathize with others who are experiencing similar situations, as they have had firsthand experience with the challenges that it brings in terms of balancing the various responsibilities and demands placed on them. In conclusion, the statement \\"I understand what that's like because I'm home alone with kids who are clamoring for my attention\\" suggests that personal experience has offered the speaker insight into the feelings and challenges faced by individuals in similar circumstances. By being the only adult in the household tasked with managing the care and well-being of the children, the speaker has learned to empathize and understand what others in such situations must be going through."},{"instruction":"In a game dubbed \\"The Miracle in Motown\\" by Jim Nantz, the Packers trailed 20-0 at halftime before pulling off a comeback in the second half.

Fact 2: An insulated cup with a cover is great for keeping beverages warm. Given the two facts above, how do you keep a cup hot? A:","output":"Given the information provided, one can deduce several ways to keep a cup hot using the principles of insulation and heat retention. 1. Choosing the Right Cup: Start with an insulated cup. These cups are often double-walled, meaning there is an inner and outer layer. The space between these layers is vacuum-sealed which reduces the rate of heat transfer, as there is no matter in a vacuum that would carry the heat away. This works on a principle of physics where heat transfer happens from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. Insulated cups reduce the rate of this transfer, keeping your beverage hotter for longer. 2. Using a Cup Cover: Using a cover on your cup further enhances the insulation effect. The primary role of the lid is to reduce heat loss through convection. Convection occurs when heat is carried away by the movement of fluids, such as air in this case. By blocking the surface of the hot beverage with a lid, we limit the exposure to cooler air and prevent the escape of the steam, which carries away heat from the beverage. This reduces heat loss and keeps the beverage warmer. 3. Preheating the Cup: Another technique often used to ensure that the beverage stays hotter for longer is preheating the insulated cup before pouring the hot beverage into it. This means pouring hot water into the cup, then dumping it out before filling the cup with the beverage. This process raises the initial temperature of the cup to prevent immediate heat loss when the hot beverage is poured. 4. Avoid Repeated Opening: The more times the cup is opened, the more opportunities for heat to escape. Try to avoid removing the lid too often or for too long - each time you do, you let steam (i.e., heat) escape and let cold air in. 5. Size of the Cup: Smaller cups or thermoses have a smaller surface area for heat loss and often, leads to the hot beverages staying warmer for longer. Larger volumes and surfaces areas tend to lose heat faster. 6. Using a Cup Sleeve or Cozy: If the cup becomes too hot to handle, that's a sign of heat escape. Cup sleeves or cozies insulate the outside of the cup, retain more heat within the beverage and protect the hands from the heat. 7. Cup Material: The cup material matters as well. Stainless steel cups are often the best at heat retention, but porcelain and ceramic are also good choices. By using these methods and principles, you can effectively help to keep a cup hot for longer periods of time."},{"instruction":"Question: Which of the following sentences is nonsensical? Options: - Sentence A: \\"They eat at the cafe.\\" - Sentence B: \\"They put monster at the cafe.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze the options step-by-step. Step 1: Examine the structure and meaning of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"They eat at the cafe.\\" Here, the subject is \\"They,\\" the verb is \\"eat,\\" and the location is \\"at the cafe.\\" The sentence describes a group of people (They) performing an action (eat) in a specific place (the cafe). This sentence follows a clear subject-verb-object structure and presents a logical situation. Sentence B: \\"They put monster at the cafe.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"They,\\" the verb is \\"put,\\" and the objects are \\"monster\\" and \\"at the cafe.\\" At first glance, it appears to have a subject-verb-object structure. However, the sentence's meaning is unclear since it's not clear what action is being performed with the \\"monster.\\" Additionally, \\"monster\\" typically requires an article, like \\"a\\" or \\"the,\\" to precede it. Step 2: Compare the coherence and logic of each sentence. Sentence A conveys a clear and logical situation, while Sentence B has an ambiguous meaning and features an unconventional usage of the word \\"monster.\\" Based on these observations, Sentence B: \\"They put monster at the cafe\\" is the nonsensical sentence."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"The small furry dog is jumping over a low beam.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The small furry dog is jumping over beams to win a blue ribbon.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","output":"In this case, we cannot say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees or strongly implies the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis to understand why this is the case: Premise: \\"The small furry dog is jumping over a low beam.\\" This statement provides information about a specific action being performed by a small furry dog, which is jumping over a low beam. Hypothesis: \\"The small furry dog is jumping over beams to win a blue ribbon.\\" This statement makes a claim about the dog's purpose or goal for jumping over beams - to win a blue ribbon. While the premise tells us that the dog is indeed jumping over a beam, it does not provide any information about the dog's motivation or the outcome (winning a blue ribbon). Therefore, the premise does not guarantee or strongly imply the truth of the hypothesis, and we cannot say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"Is the premise \\"A boy in a blue life jacket jumps into the water.\\" true if \\"There is a boy in a red sweater.\\"?

A sigma (σ) orbital (bonding) or a sigma star (σ*) orbital(antibonding) is symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Hence all cross-sections perpendicular to that axis are circular. Both a pi (π) orbital (bonding) and a pi star (π*) orbital (antibonding) possess a nodal plane that contains the nuclei, with electron density localized on both sides of the plane. The energies of the molecular orbitals versus those of the parent atomic orbitals can be shown schematically in an energy-level diagram. The electron configuration of a molecule is shown by placing the correct number of electrons in the appropriate energy-level diagram, starting with the lowest-energy orbital and obeying the Pauli principle; that is, placing only two electrons with opposite spin in each orbital. From the completed energy-level diagram, we can calculate thebond order, defined as one-half the net number of bonding electrons. In bond orders, electrons in antibonding molecular orbitals cancel electrons in bonding molecular orbitals, while electrons in nonbonding orbitals have no effect and are not counted. Bond orders of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. Molecules with predicted bond orders of 0 are generally less stable than the isolated atoms and do not normally exist. Molecular orbital energy-level diagrams for diatomic molecules can be created if the electron configuration of the parent atoms is known, following a few simple rules. Most important, the number of molecular orbitals in a molecule is the same as the number of atomic orbitals that interact. The difference between bonding and antibonding molecular orbital combinations is proportional to the overlap of the parent orbitals and decreases as the energy difference between the parent atomic...

From the given text, it can be inferred that the main character is in a small, claustrophobic hallway in a mobile home and is being asked by Jake to enter a tiny bathroom. Step 2: Continue the Story Now that I understand the context, I will continue the story in a way that maintains the overall mood and style whilst providing a coherent narrative. Jake looked at me, a reassuring smile playing on his lips. \\"Don't worry,\\" he said softly, noticing my unease. \\"It'll only take a moment, and I promise it won't be that bad.\\" Step 3: Describe the Actions In order to build suspense and engage the reader, I will describe the character's movements and actions in detail. Hesitantly, I took a deep breath to steel myself and stepped into the cramped bathroom. The floor creaked under me, and I uncomfortably squeezed myself into the tight space between Jake and the toilet. The musty smell of the room closed in around us, only intensifying my anxiety. Step 4: Include Dialogue Dialogue helps to develop characters and relationships while keeping the story moving forward. I will include dialogue that reflects the characters' feelings and reactions to the situation. As I settled into the minuscule space, I let out a small, nervous laugh. \\"You weren't kidding about it being tight in here, huh?\\" I joked weakly, trying to break the uneasy silence between us.

With a final deep breath, I focused on the rhythmic sound of my inhales and exhales. As Jake began to work with the mysterious bottle and cloth, I closed my eyes, trying to block out the overwhelming proximity of the walls around us. At last, after what felt like an eternity in that suffocating space, Jake finished his task. \\"All done,\\" he proclaimed, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me as we stepped back out into the restless hallway."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Heat is necessary for the survival of animals. , and ask you the question \\"what is necessary for the survival of animals?\\", is the correct answer \\"honey\\"?

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself...

They meet a mechanical man, Tik-Tok, who explains that King Scarecrow has been captured by the Nome King, who is responsible for the Emerald City's destruction. The three visit princess Mombi in hopes of getting more information, but she is working with the Nome King and imprisons them. Dorothy, Billina, and Tik-Tok meet Jack Pumpkinhead, who explains he was brought to life via Mombi's Powder of Life. Dorothy uses the Powder of Life to vivify the Gump, the head of a moose-like animal whose body they put together using two sofas, palm leaves, a broom, and rope. Using the Gump as transport, the group escapes and flies across the Deadly Desert to reach the Nome King's mountain. In his underground domain, the Nome King tells Dorothy that the Scarecrow stole the emeralds from him to build the Emerald City, and should be punished. He does not listen when Dorothy protests that the emeralds preceded the Scarecrow at the city. The Scarecrow has been turned into an ornament, and the group has three guesses each to identify which one he is, or they will be turned into ornaments themselves. The Gump, Jack and Tik-Tok each fail and are turned into ornaments. The Nome King gives... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Return to Oz,\\" the Scarecrow was turned into an ornament by the Nome King. The Nome King accused Scarecrow of stealing emeralds from him to build the Emerald City and punished him by transforming him into an ornament. Dorothy and her friends were given three guesses each to identify which ornament the Scarecrow had become, or else they too would be turned into ornaments. The Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Tik-Tok all failed in their attempts, ultimately being turned into ornaments themselves. The Nome King then gave Dorothy an extra chance to guess correctly but used this as an opportunity to deceive her by making the Scarecrow's ornament form seemingly more challenging to discern. Despite the Nome King's deception, Dorothy successfully identified the Scarecrow's ornament form by recognizing a faint emerald glow as a hint to his presence. Upon correctly guessing the ornament, the Scarecrow was transformed back into his original form, allowing Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and their friends to continue their quest to save the Land of Oz from the Nome King's clutches and restore the Emerald City to its former glory."},{"instruction":"The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Question: \\"In what year did the Romans travel from Gual to France?\\" Answer: \\"125 BC\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

The giant sequoia was known for having a hole cut through its trunk - big enough for a car to drive through. The tree, estimated to be more than 1,000-years-old, was felled by the strongest storm to have hit the area in more than a decade. California and Nevada have been hit by unusually high rainfall levels, leading to flooding and falling trees. The Calaveras Big Trees Association first reported that the drive-through Pioneer Cabin Tree - carved 137 years ago - was no more. The storm was \\"just too much for it\\", the group wrote in a Facebook post that has drawn nearly 2,000 comments. \\"Many memories were created under this tree,\\" one read. \\"They will remain good memories.\\" Others pointed out that the tree might have survived for longer if a tunnel had not been carved into it. \\"You can't cut a hole in a tree like this and expect it to live,\\" said one comment. \\"This hole always bothered me so much. Why not just drive around it?\\" Park volunteer Jim Allday said the sequoia, also known as the Tunnel Tree, shattered as it hit the ground. \\"We lost an old friend today,\\" he wrote in a social media post.

From July 1 only notes with the image of Adam Smith, the Scottish economist, will be legal tender. These notes came into circulation in March 2007. About 10 per cent of all £20 notes in circulation – equating to 150 million notes, worth £3 billion – are the old versions featuring the English composer. They were introduced in June 1999 along with a view of the west face of Worcester Cathedral, replacing the previous series of notes featuring Michael Faraday, the physicist, and before that William Shakespeare. The Adam Smith design was introduced to cut down on forgeries. The new £20 design included more of the printed words raised and a greater number of flecks that show bright red and green under an ultraviolet light. Old notes will eventually be sent to one of the official Government incinerators, where they will burned alongside damaged notes. A small amount of thermoelectric power is generated by these sites, which also burn illegal tobacco seized by HM Revenue & Customs at British ports. After June 30 if a bank or building society refuses to swap a note, consumers have the right to swap the notes at the Bank of England itself.

This refers to a method of writing that arrived around the 14th century, which took influence from Old English styles of alliteration. The poem itself is written in stanzas of unequal length- all ending in a short bob and wheel. To explain further, Alliterative Revival is a form of poetry that uses alliteration as the main structural element of a line, along with a particular rhythm. 'Alliteration' refers to the repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighbouring words or stressed syllables, which generates a natural rhythm on the page and in reading aloud. As for the 'bob and wheel', it's a subset of Alliterative Revival, but unique to Middle English alliterative verse and became highly prominent in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight”. The stanza ends with this compact chunk known as the 'bob and wheel': the bob is simply a very short line, often only two or three syllables, followed by the wheel, which consists of four lines that rhyme together. The rhyme scheme for these lines is typically ABABA. For example, the first stanza ends: \\"But of deeds of arms and derring do In Vance the king greatly stood out.\\" Bob: \\"With a broad banner borne aloft,\\" Wheel: \\"Boldly he played his part, this bear, Killer of men in his cruel rage, Fierce and furious, never flinching.\\" This combination of alliteration and established rhyme scheme helps to build the rhythm and epic quality that the children of the Alliterative Revival, including \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" are known for. Hence, that is an in-depth explanation for the verse-form for \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" Not only does it have a unique structure, but it ties into the tradition of oral storytelling, where alliteration and rhyme helped storytellers to remember their lengthy tales."},{"instruction":"Question: The hardest thing was having to give up my three beautiful puppies due to my situation, the environment, and the people in that environment.

I never loved anything more in this world than these three right here. I raised them from birth to almost 11 weeks. While my mom wanted money, selling the others to anyone.(there was 11 in the litter) I cared for their safety and happiness and quality of life. They were my everything when I had nothing. I gave them away to a animal charity organization for free. My mom bitched at me for not getting money for them.

In this multi-choice question, two sentences are presented, and we are asked to determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Here is the analysis of the two sentences under the assumptions that they are true: 1. Sentence 1: Volume II will present the following appendices and may present The first sentence states that Volume II will contain certain appendices, and there is a possibility that it may present something else. Overall, this sentence implies that the content of Volume II is planned and somewhat predictable. However, it does not specify whether the volume is complete or still in the process of being edited or revised. It simply describes what will be included in the final version of Volume II. 2. Sentence 2: Volume II is incomplete and needs revision. The second sentence specifically states that Volume II is currently incomplete and requires revisions. This does not contradict the first sentence, as it does not specify whether the volume is complete or still in the process of being edited or revised. It just highlights the status of the volume at the moment. Given the information provided in Sentence 1, we cannot conclusively determine whether Sentence 2 is indeed true because it does not give enough information about the status of Volume II. The first sentence states what will be included in the published version of Volume II while the second sentence states the current condition of the same volume.

Such a task should challenge their comprehension of concepts, such as force, motion, energy, and the laws governing these phenomena. The task should also require deductive and logical thinking, assessment of multiple possible solutions, and understanding the consequences of various actions. Here is a detailed example of such a task: Task: Designing and constructing a functional Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is a deliberately complex and intricate apparatus that performs simple tasks through a series of interconnected and sequential reactions. The goal of this task is to create a machine that achieves a specific outcome (e.g., popping a balloon, pouring a glass of water, ringing a bell) through a sequence of reactions that involve various physical principles and objects. This task not only tests physical reasoning but also creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. The detailed steps for the task are as follows: 1. Define the objective: Clearly outline the desired outcome of the Rube Goldberg machine (e.g., to ring a bell). This provides a tangible goal and criteria for assessing success. 2. Identify physical principles: Brainstorm the different physical principles, such as force, motion, gravity, friction, and energy conservation, that can be utilized to achieve the desired outcome. Consider how these principles can be combined or manipulated to create the chain reaction necessary for the machine's functioning. 3. Choose appropriate materials: Determine which materials and objects can best demonstrate the identified physical principles. For example, balls, dominoes, pulleys, levers, and inclined planes can all be used to transfer energy and implement physical reactions. Select materials that are readily available and suitable for the task. 4. Design the machine: Plan the layout of the Rube Goldberg machine, ensuring that each component is logically and sequentially connected to the others. Each step should trigger the next, leading to the ultimate desired outcome. Sketch out a detailed blueprint of the machine, denoting the placement and functioning of each component. 5. Construct the machine: Based on the blueprint, assemble and build the Rube Goldberg machine. This may involve collaborating with others and adjusting the design as necessary to ensure that the machine works as intended. Test individual components and reactions throughout the process to identify and correct any issues. 6. Test the machine: Once constructed, test the Rube Goldberg machine in its entirety, observing the functioning of each component and noting any issues or inconsistencies in the sequence. Refine and optimize the design as needed, making adjustments to improve performance and reliability. 7. Evaluate performance: Assess the performance of the completed Rube Goldberg machine based on the objective defined at the outset. Consider the efficiency, repeatability, and overall functionality in achieving the desired outcome. By completing this task, the participant will have demonstrated their ability to perform physical reasoning across multiple aspects – comprehension of physical principles, problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity in designing an intricate sequence of reactions. The process will also test their ability to experiment, adapt, and refine their solutions as they work toward achieving a specific goal, showcasing their detailed understanding of physical phenomena and their applications."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Would \\"South Africa's s (approximately long) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Water jet propulsion refers to a type of propulsion system used in marine vessels, where a jet of water is expelled at high speeds to generate thrust. This method is an efficient way of propelling boats and ships, as it utilizes the surrounding water as the driving force, instead of relying on the internal reactions of an engine. Water jet propulsion systems typically have a pump that intakes water from below the hull, increases its pressure, and then forces it out through a nozzle, propelling the vessel forward. The given statement, \\"South Africa's s (approximately long) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far,\\" may not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it doesn't directly address the definition or fundamental concept of water jet propulsion. The statement appears to be incomplete and seems to refer to a specific example of jet-propelled vessels without adequately defining water jet propulsion itself. Moreover, the statement has a missing context where \\"s\\" needs to be replaced by the name of the jet-propelled vessels referred to. A more suitable answer to the question would be: \\"Water jet propulsion is a type of marine propulsion system that uses a jet of water expelled at high speeds to generate thrust. It involves a pump that intakes water from beneath the vessel, compresses it, and ejects it through a nozzle, propelling the vessel forward. This method offers several advantages, such as improved maneuverability, shallow draft capabilities, and reduced risk of damage to the propulsion system.\\""},{"instruction":"A diamond worth £12,000 was shot into space this morning - and whoever finds it when it lands back on earth gets to keep it.

The diamond will then parachute back down to earth in a giant orange parachute - and whoever finds it will be a cool £12,000 richer. This diamond worth £12,000 has today been shot into space, and whoever finds it gets to keep it.

Jessica Biel shows off her 'modified cushion brilliant cut' engagement ring at the MET gala in May 2012. Bosses at 77 Diamonds, which takes its name from the first ever diamond engagement ring given by Archduke Maximilian I of Austria to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, say the stunt is to raise awareness of the firm's access to 80 per cent of the world's finest polished diamonds. It is also aimed at promoting its so-called interactive universe, called Diamonds in the Sky, which allows users to fill a virtual night sky with thousands of stars - each one unique and named after someone special. Tobias Kormind, co-founder of 77 Diamonds, says: 'We are very excited about the launch. 'What better way to raise awareness of our virtual universe than by actually making it a reality and putting a diamond in the sky for the first time ever.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays. An important lesson for the price of a Little League baseball glove. Question: This passage shows us that to run a business well it is necessary for managers to let their employees know _ . Answer: A:","output":"[iii] they are very necessary to the business. The passage highlights that managers need to show their employees genuine care and concern, which would make them feel significant and valued within the organization.

Poor Plot Development: The plot of \\"A Dismal Disaster\\" is an uninspired, convoluted mess. I suspect that the creators were attempting to piece together several different ideas without a cohesive central theme. This lack of focus resulted in a jumbled array of subplots that left the viewer more confused than satisfied. The twists and turns seemed forced and illogical, robbing the movie of any sense of satisfaction or accomplishment. 2. Lackluster Performances: While there may have been potential for the actors to shine, their performances were underwhelming, to say the least. It appeared that the cast was as lost with the script as the audience, resulting in shallow character development and a detachment from their roles. This lack of depth prevented the audience from emotionally connecting with the characters, leading to an inability to care about their fates. 3. Awful Visual Effects: Considering the advancements in technology and the vast array of tools available to filmmakers, it is puzzling how the visual effects in this movie were so shockingly bad. Not only were the CGI elements of the movie laughably unrealistic, but the editing and color grading were equally inferior. It left the viewer struggling to maintain any semblance of immersion in the story. 4. Disappointing Score: A movie's soundtrack can often help evoke emotion and enhance a film's impact. Unfortunately, the score in \\"A Dismal Disaster\\" was utterly forgettable and simply did not align with the scenes. It seemed as if the composer picked random tracks rather than carefully selecting and creating pieces that would elevate the overall experience of the movie. 5. Sloppy Directing: Lastly, the film's direction was a noticeable letdown. The director failed to extract the best out of their crew and cast, which greatly contributed to the movie's downfall. Weak pacing, inconsistent camera work, and an overall lack of vision severely hampered this movie from ever achieving its potential. In conclusion, \\"A Dismal Disaster\\" sadly failed to deliver on its promise. The combination of a convoluted plot, weak performances, terrible visual effects, a forgettable score, and poor direction resulted in a movie experience that can only be described as an arduous ordeal. For anyone seeking a pleasant cinematic experience, this movie is an option best avoided."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Los Angeles for the following movie plot: Heather Langenkamp lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband Chase and their young son Dylan. Heather has become quite popular due to her role as Nancy Thompson from the Nightmare on Elm Street film series. One night, she has a nightmare in which she, Dylan, and Chase are attacked by a set of animated Krueger claws of an upcoming Nightmare film in which two of the workers are brutally murdered on set. Waking up to an earthquake, she spies a cut on Chase's finger exactly like one he had received in his dream, but they quickly dismiss the notion. Heather receives a call from an obsessed fan who calls and quotes Freddy's nursery rhyme in an eerie Freddy-like voice. This coincides with a meeting she has with New Line Cinema in which she is pitched an idea to reprise her role as Nancy in a new Nightmare film, which Chase had been working on, unknown to her at the time.

While his wife, Beth (Anne Archer), and daughter, Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), are out of town for the weekend, he has an affair with Alex. Though it was understood by both as a fling initially, she starts clinging on to him. Dan stays on a second unplanned evening with Alex in which she persistently asked him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her to bandage them and later leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of Madame Butterfly, but he politely turns her down. She then continues to telephone until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours, and then confronts him claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. She shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, he goes to her apartment to confront her, which results in a violent scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored. Dan moves his family to Bedford, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach.

Cameron came along and played chess with Taylor. Given the context: How would Cameron feel afterwards? A:","output":"To determine how Cameron might feel after playing chess with Taylor, let's analyze each choice provided: a) Guilty - Guilt typically arises from a feeling of responsibility for something wrong or harmful. In this context, Cameron and Taylor were just playing a game of chess. There's no indication that Cameron did anything wrong or harmful, so it's unlikely that Cameron would feel guilty. b) Good - Cameron participated in a fun activity with Taylor by playing a game of chess. Engaging in such activities generally generates positive emotions, like happiness, satisfaction, or enjoyment. Thus, the likelihood of Cameron feeling good after playing chess with Taylor is relatively high. c) Jealous - Jealousy often involves a sense of insecurity or fear of losing something or someone. In this case, there's no mention of any rivalry or competition between Cameron and Taylor or any reason for Cameron to feel like they're missing out on something. So, it's improbable that Cameron would feel jealous after playing chess with Taylor. Considering the context and analyzing each choice, option B (good) seems to be the most reasonable answer to the question: How would Cameron feel afterwards? Playing a game of chess with Taylor likely brought feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction for Cameron."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Cuando Mihret Mehari se quedó embarazada de su hija Dagmawit, se enteró de que podía prevenir la transmisión del VIH a su bebé si recibía tratamiento.

The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said.

He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood. He also states he is a killer, but despite this, Becca agrees to go to prom with Edward.

Both sentences provide percentages (6.6% and 0.4%) for the number of unmarried partnerships and same-sex couples or partnerships, respectively. Differences: 1. The first sentence presents the information on unmarried partnerships but does not specify whether these are opposite-sex or same-sex partnerships.

The band's name is taken from lyrics in the song \\"Head on Collision\\" by New Found Glory. The band consistently tours year-long, has headlined numerous tours, and has appeared at music festivals including Warped Tour, Reading and Leeds and Soundwave. Formed while still in high school in 2003, All Time Low began covering songs by pop punk bands such as Blink-182. The band's line-up included Alex Gaskarth on vocals, Jack Barakat on guitar, TJ Ihle on lead guitar and backing vocals, Chris Cortilello on bass, and Rian Dawson on drums. Cortilello and Ihle left the band, resulting in the band laying dormant until Zack Merrick joined on bass and Gaskarth picked up guitar.

In December, it was announced that the band was no longer signed, but were attracting attention from a number of record labels. In late 2006, the band performed a showcase for John Janick the founder of record label Fueled by Ramen. They were not signed because Cute Is What We Aim For had recently been taken on by the label, which was not in a position to sign another band at the time. The band was brought to the attention of Hopeless Records by fellow touring band Amber Pacific; on March 28, 2006, it was announced that All Time Low had signed with Hopeless.

In his new film, West goes fully dark as real-life serial killer Fred West (no relation). Appropriate Adult, which airs on the Sundance Channel on Dec. 10, recounts the 1994 investigation of Fred and his wife Rosemary, who were charged with torturing and murdering 11 women and girls in and around their Gloucester, England, home. With Emily Watson in the role of the “appropriate adult” — the title for the social worker assigned to the case — the film focuses on the unlikely bond she forms with the murderer. It’s grim stuff, yet Dominic’s performance is enthralling. He spoke to TIME about getting inside the mind of a killer, being the bad guy and why he wouldn’t mind if McNulty were mentioned on his gravestone. The account of Fred and Rosemary West’s crimes is one of the most gruesome stories I’ve ever come across. Yet your rendering of Fred showed how charismatic he could be as well. Is duality something you look for in a character? Well, I suppose that’s where the dramatic tension comes from, isn’t it? By any account, Fred [was charismatic], and any pictures you see of the police with him, they’re usually laughing and smiling. And he was likable and he was funny and he had a certain charm, which belied his monstrous qualities. And, of course, that’s interesting to play. It makes it all the more complex and dramatic. Would you have thought twice if it’d been a different sort of script — one that depicted the actual crimes rather than the investigation? I think definitely, yes. I mean, it all depends on the writing, but it’s not his story. It doesn’t go into his crimes any more than to illuminate his ability to manipulate and to destroy the life of the appropriate adult. There was quite a lot of controversy in the papers [in Britain] before anyone saw the film, and I suppose people had very legitimate concerns. There are people who are still alive, whose lives have been ruined by this man, and the concerns were that if it ever ventured into the territory of horror or pornography or sensationalism it would have been morally wrong to do. But I think that the fact it didn’t, that it was centered on [Emily Watson’s character] and West’s effect on her, made it an acceptable thing to do. (MORE: The Top 10 TV Murder-Mystery Series) There’s quite a bit of black humor in the film, which was a surprise. I would laugh out loud and then feel guilty immediately after. Was that a hard balance to strike, describing horrific crimes with just a bit of ridiculousness? It wasn’t in the acting. It was all in what he was saying. What I say in the film is pretty much verbatim what he said in the real police interviews. The humor comes from the chasm, his failure to connect. So there was no difference for him from putting out a sack of trash and putting out the remains of his daughter. He just was not able to see that they were morally different things. It was an extraordinary psychology. Inevitably it led to humor in terms of his flippancy, in terms of things that were horrendously serious. Many of the characters you’ve played are dishonorable, if not outright evil. Do you ever worry you’re being typecast? Damn right, I do! All I seem to play is bloody villains! [Laughs] I’m dying to play a hero. The difficulty with villains is that they’re usually more interesting to play and they’re usually funnier. Of course, you have to be careful when talking about Fred West in those terms, but [villains’] complexities tend to be more challenging and, therefore, more interesting. But I’ve got to go out now and play a nice guy. I think inevitably you start thinking, Why do people think I’m so appropriate to play these parts? Is it giving you a complex? Yeah, a little bit! I think it must be some weird look I’ve got in my eye, but I’m actually quite a nice person. I wanted to ask you about your accent. To my ear, both your Gloucester accent and your American accent were pitch-perfect. How much effort do you have to put into your accents? Well, sometimes accents give you the character and therefore when you put on the accent, you get into the character. I found that very much with Fred West. I also had these false teeth and you feel very different wearing them. It was much easier talking in the Gloucester accent when I was wearing those teeth. With the Baltimore accent, it was always a struggle. It was a hard slog, that one, trying to get that right. You know I’m going to have to ask you about The Wire now, right? How tired are you of questions about Jimmy McNulty? Well, I always like talking about The Wire because it was such a great experience for me and I’m so fond of what we did, but … actually, I was just talking to someone about this, because it’s the show’s 10th anniversary, and I said that after 10 years, it’s about time that I shut up about it. [Laughs] (See The Wire on the All-TIME 100 TV Shows) Is it a concern that you might always be best remembered for McNulty? No, no, that’s never a concern. I think it’s a great piece of work and I’m very proud to have been in it. It would be a problem if people only identified me as a Baltimore cop, but I don’t think they do anymore. No, I’m proud. If that was written on my gravestone — that, and “He was a good dad” — it would do me fine. The online magazine Slate recently dubbed The Wire as television’s modern classic — the show that’s most likely to endure. Do you agree? Great! Of course I do. I don’t know, I don’t watch a lot of telly, but its impact and people’s affection for it is certainly undiminished after 10 years. Particularly in the U.K., I still have people coming up to me. It seems to be enduring. I start next week on the second season of the BBC series The Hour. I do that all winter and then John Carter, which is a big Disney film, comes out. And I play the baddy in that.

This is because most countries, particularly developed ones, have hospitals in every state to cater to the health needs of residents and travelers alike. In case of a medical emergency, one can be assured that a hospital wouldn't be too far. On the other hand, hospitals are not guaranteed to be where people are, especially if they are in remote areas.

Here are possible answers to this question: - brightness - sunny delight - direct sunlight - bright light - tanning I believe the correct choice is \\"direct sunlight\\", here's why:","output":"The plant that suffered in the shade likely needed more sunlight than it was receiving. This means the correct place to plant it would be in direct sunlight. The term 'direct sunlight' refers to areas that receive full, unobstructed sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. This condition is ideal for many types of plants that require a lot of sunlight to perform photosynthesis effectively. Depending on the type of plant, it's possible that it could have also thrived under 'bright light.' Typically, a spot with bright light is near a south- or southwest-facing window that receives direct sunlight for a part of the day but is not in the sun's path the entire day. The terms 'brightness,' 'sunny delight,' and 'tanning' are not standard gardening terms used to describe the sun conditions needed for plants. Therefore, they are not suitable answers for this question, making 'direct sunlight' the ideal choice. Keep in mind, though, that different plants have different sunlight and shade requirements. Some may thrive in partial shade or indirect light, while others need a few hours of direct sunlight each day. Always research the individual needs of each plant to ensure it's placed in an ideal location. In conclusion, \\"direct sunlight\\" is the correct term because it refers to the specific condition in gardening where a plant receives unobstructed sunlight for a significant part of the day, which is ultimately what the shaded plant in your question is lacking."},{"instruction":"Solve 9*o - 50 + 41 = 0 for o.

Both sentences communicate that Tarde was born in Sarlat, which is in the province of Dordogne, and that he studied law in Toulouse and Paris.

She was taken in by elderly Fuzzy (Henry Travers), and gave birth to Mickey (Jackie Kelk) in the back room of Fuzzy's bookstore at the age of fifteen. Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son. Now seven years old, Mickey skips school and does as he pleases. Meanwhile, Letty earns a living by entertaining buyers so they will give business to her friend Steve Karns. A milk truck driven by Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Trevor (Cary Grant) hits Mickey as he is rollerskating in the street. When Letty's lawyer, Adolphe, learns that Mal is the wealthy president of Amalgamated Dairies (out checking every aspect of his large business), he talks Letty into seizing the opportunity to make some money. They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney (Paul Harvey) produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns) have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives. Letty is not satisfied with this arrangement; she wants her son back. Adolph suggests she seduce Mal and blackmail him into giving her Mickey (as well as money) with a recording of their conversation. The plan works; Mal admits he has fallen in love with her, and they spend the night together. The next morning, however, Mal informs a surprised Letty that he has told his wife. Alyce is willing to sacrifice herself for Mal's happiness. Letty comes to realize her genuine feelings for Mal, and breaks up with him, pretending to have only been toying with him.

Burrows and another pastor say the inmates, including two Australians, three Nigerians, and a Ghanaian man, refused blindfolds and sang hymns as they were shot down.","output":"Title: A Disturbing International Controversy: The Execution of a Mentally Ill Drug Smuggler in Indonesia Introduction The recent execution of eight inmates in Indonesia has triggered international outrage and brought attention to the country's approach towards the death penalty, particularly in the case of Rodrigo Muxfeldt Gularte. Reports suggest that Gularte, a Brazilian national sentenced to death for drug smuggling, was too mentally ill to comprehend the reality of his situation. The catholic priest, Charlie Burrows, who was with Gularte in his final moments, shares his observations that reveal the inmate's distraught mental state. Gularte's Story According to Charlie Burrows, who spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 42-year-old Gularte was suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The priest mentions that while Gularte initially seemed calm, when the chains were being fastened, he shockingly asked, \\"Oh father, am I being executed?\\" This demonstrates the lack of awareness Gularte had about his impending death. Burrows also notes that in Gularte's final days, he heard voices telling him that everything would be fine and he would be going home next year. It became apparent that in his delusional state, Gularte believed the voices more than anyone else, demonstrating the severity of his mental illness. Gularte had been diagnosed with schizophrenia during his teenage years, which further supports the claims made by the priest. International Reaction The Brazilian government was deeply disturbed by the execution of one of their citizens in Indonesia. The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, expressed her \\"deep consternation\\" at Gularte's execution. In 2005, Gularte was sentenced to death in Indonesia for smuggling several kilos of cocaine into the country. The Brazilian government had already pulled its ambassador from Indonesia in response to another Brazilian citizen being killed in a mass execution of drug smugglers in January. The Unsettling Scene at the Execution Grounds Despite the hopelessness of their situation, the eight inmates displayed remarkable courage in their final moments. Burrows, along with another pastor present at the scene, mentions that the inmates, which included two Australians, three Nigerians, and a Ghanaian man, refused blindfolds and sang hymns as they were shot down. The disturbing image of these executions raises serious questions about Indonesia's judicial practices. Conclusion The execution of Rodrigo Muxfeldt Gularte, a mentally ill Brazilian national, has spurred a critical debate about the ethics of Indonesia's capital punishment system. As international voices condemn Indonesia's approach to the death penalty, especially in cases involving mentally ill inmates, it is imperative that the Indonesian government reassesses its stand on capital punishment. In doing so, it would be crucial to consider, if merely being a potential deterrent is enough of a justification for meting out possibly irreversible, life-ending punishment to those who might not fully comprehend the gravity of their actions due to their mental illnesses."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: An Expert says It's great Review: I searched long and hard for the coffee cup with the longest heat retention.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"If we suppose that the pressure causes weaker gravity in the perturbation hypothesis, it would affect a smaller black hole in the following ways: 1. Lower gravity would result in a weaker gravitational pull, which means that the surrounding materials and any objects that would have been drawn into the black hole (under normal circumstances) might not be affected as strongly. This could lead to fewer particles and masses being drawn into the black hole. 2. With lower gravity, the process which forms black holes might be affected. If the pressure isn't strong enough to condense the core of a dying star sufficiently, it might not form a black hole. Instead, it could result in a different type of astronomical object, such as a neutron star or a white dwarf depending on the mass of the original star. 3. If weaker gravity affects a black hole's ability to \\"grow,\\" it might remain a relatively smaller mass than black holes formed under normal circumstances. This could limit its potential to impact the surrounding space and any nearby celestial bodies. 4. If light can escape the weaker gravity of the smaller black hole, it may no longer be considered a black hole. Usually, black holes are defined as regions of spacetime where the gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. If the perturbation affects this critical aspect, the black hole might no longer fit the traditional definition. Overall, the supposed perturbation could lead to a lower likelihood of black hole formation or a different type of black hole that might not exhibit all the properties of traditionally understood black holes. This would ultimately have both direct and indirect effects on the aforementioned processes."},{"instruction":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process.

I will consider various sources, such as research papers, articles, and official reports. Then, I will analyze the collected data to identify the key factors contributing to HIV's spread. Step 1: Research and gather information I would start by searching for relevant research papers, articles, and government or NGO reports on the issue. Websites like Google Scholar, PubMed, and World Health Organization would provide credible sources. Step 2: Analyze the information After collecting the information, I would analyze the factors mentioned in sources, looking for common themes and patterns. This would help me determine which factors are most pertinent to Nigeria's situation. Step 3: Identify the key factors Based on my analysis, I would identify the factors that are the most prominent contributors to the spread of HIV in Nigeria. These factors may include: 1. Limited access to education and awareness: Many people in Nigeria, particularly in rural areas, may lack access to accurate information about HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment. This contributes to the spread of the virus, as misinformation and stigma lead to risky behaviors. 2. Socio-economic factors: Poverty, gender inequality, and unemployment can increase the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors, such as transactional sex or multiple concurrent partnerships. 3. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure: Insufficient healthcare resources, including HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services, can contribute to the spread of the virus. Additionally, inadequate training and knowledge among healthcare providers can result in poor handling of cases, increasing the risk of transmission. 4. High-risk behaviors: Behaviors such as unprotected sex, particularly among individuals with multiple partners, and intravenous drug use can increase the risk of HIV transmission. 5. Stigma and discrimination: Stigmatization and discrimination against people living with HIV discourage them from seeking testing, treatment, and support, which can further increase the spread of the virus. By following these steps and carefully analyzing the information gathered, I can conclude that the main factors contributing to the spread of HIV in Nigeria are limited access to education and awareness, socio-economic factors, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, high-risk behaviors, and stigma and discrimination."},{"instruction":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death.

It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Identify the goal The main goal for a young bird that is still nesting is to move on and become independent. Step 2: Analyze the options a. Spread wings: This is a necessary step for a bird to take flight, but it is not enough to accomplish the ultimate goal. b. Squawk: This does not contribute significantly to the bird's ability to move on and become independent. c. Learn to fly: A crucial skill for a young bird to move on and survive in the wild. d. Attempt to fly: Trying to fly can be part of the process of learning to fly, which is an important skill for a bird. e. Catch food: Although important for survival, a bird must learn to fly before being able to catch food efficiently. Step 3: Evaluate the importance of each option To move on and become independent, a bird must prioritize learning to fly and catching food. However, learning to fly takes precedence, as it enables the bird to catch food and avoid predators more effectively. Step 4: Rank the options according to importance 1. Learn to fly 2. Attempt to fly 3. Catch food 4. Spread wings 5. Squawk Step 5: Conclusion For a young bird that is still nesting to move on and become independent, it should primarily focus on learning to fly.

She talked about “domestic enemies” in the Congress and said, “I hope we’re not getting to Second Amendment remedies.” Then there’s Rick Barber, a Republican who lost his primary in a Congressional race in Alabama, but not before airing an ad in which someone dressed as George Washington listened to an attack on the Obama agenda and gravely proclaimed, “Gather your armies.” In fact, much of the message among Republicans last year, as they sought to exploit the Tea Party phenomenon, centered — like the Tea Party moniker itself — on this imagery of armed revolution. Popular spokespeople like Ms. Palin routinely drop words like “tyranny” and “socialism” when describing the president and his allies, as if blind to the idea that Americans legitimately faced with either enemy would almost certainly take up arms. It’s not that such leaders are necessarily trying to incite violence or hysteria; in fact, they’re not. It’s more that they are so caught up in a culture of hyperbole, so amused with their own verbal flourishes and the ensuing applause, that — like the bloggers and TV hosts to which they cater — they seem to lose their hold on the power of words.

On Saturday, for instance, Michael Steele, the Republican Party chairman, was among the first to issue a statement saying he was “shocked and horrified” by the Arizona shooting, and no doubt he was. But it was Mr. Steele who, last March, said he hoped to send Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the “firing line.” Mr. Steele didn’t mean this the way it sounded, of course; he was talking about “firing” in the pink slip sense of the word. But his carelessly constructed, made-for-television rhetoric reinforced the dominant imagery of the moment — a portrayal of 21st-century Washington as being like 18th-century Lexington and Concord, an occupied country on the verge of armed rebellion. Contrast that with one of John McCain’s finer moments as a presidential candidate in 2008, when a woman at a Minnesota town hall meeting asserted that Mr. Obama was a closeted Arab. “No, ma’am, he’s not,” Mr. McCain quickly replied, taking back the microphone. “He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with.” Mr. McCain was harking back to a different moment in American politics, in which such disagreements could be intense without becoming existential clashes in which the freedom of the country was at stake. None of this began last year, or even with Mr. Obama or with the Tea Party; there were constant intimations during George W. Bush’s presidency that he was a modern Hitler or the devious designer of an attack on the World Trade Center, a man whose very existence threatened the most cherished American ideals. The more pressing question, though, is where this all ends — whether we will begin to re-evaluate the piercing pitch of our political debate in the wake of Saturday’s shooting, or whether we are hurtling unstoppably into a frightening period more like the late 1960s. The country labors still to recover from the memories of Dealey Plaza and the Ambassador Hotel, of Memphis and Birmingham and Watts. Tucson will either be the tragedy that brought us back from the brink, or the first in a series of gruesome memories to come. ||||| WASHINGTON -- The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is a watershed event in many ways, some of which we cannot yet know, but one of the clearest and simplest is this: Congress and its members are about to be permanently quarantined, physically isolated, from the people it and they represent. Thirty years ago, there was no such thing as security on Capitol Hill or for members. Members of the public were free to roam the halls, and police presence was practically invisible. There were no barricades around the grounds, and even the leadership rarely had any form of protection. The Hill was the very model of the People's Place -- and in that respect it was an inspirational symbol of our democracy. Congress began to close in on itself in 1983. A bomb explosion outside the Senate chamber engendered the installation of magnatometers; in 1998 a gunman shot two Capitol Police in an attack in the House. The result was a system of careful monitoring of all visitors and the extension of police protection to all members of the leadership. The 9/11 attacks led to the erection of barricades and new defense perimeters around the grounds; new inspection procedures were initiated after an anthrax attack in 2003 on the offices of then-Democratic leader Tom Daschle's office. The construction of a new Visitor Center now means that the public can only enter through a secure facility and can only walk the halls in tour groups. New even more restrictive rules are now inevitable. It's even possible that the general public will be banned from the hallways of the Capitol Complex, at least at certain times and under certain circumstances. As for personal protection, that is likely to be increased substantially. For the last year or two, some House members and senators have had unpublicized but substantial security details dispatched to their side when deemed warranted. The Huffington Post has learned that one Democratic senator had a special security detail detailed to him for two weeks after concerns were raised about personal threats. But rather than have extensive details for each member, the members are likely to change their behavior -- which means they will stay behind closed doors here in DC and in their home districts and states. Following the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Saturday the U.S. Capitol Police issued the following statement and guidance to lawmakers: ||||| Sorry, the page you requested was not found.

While senators monopolize the Sunday talk shows and minor Cabinet members travel with security details worthy of a Third World dictator, House members have always been the ones holding town meetings, visiting senior citizen centers, and chatting with neighbors in the Safeway. Ever since she was elected to the House in 2006 from a Republican-leaning, Tucson-centered district, Arizona Democrat Gabrielle Giffords has personified this belief that the personal touch could trump political differences. In her first term alone, she made 340 public appearances in her district. Upholding this tradition of accessibility this week, her office advertised that Giffords would be holding a Saturday \\" Congress on Your Corner \\" event at a Safeway in northwest Tucson. The press release advised, \\"For the media, 'Congress on Your Corner' is an excellent opportunity to view the congresswoman interacting with constituents or to ask questions about any topic.\\"That invitation to watch the congresswoman talk to voters and to quiz her on anything was the essence of democracy. The heart-rending shooting of Giffords in the head at that event – and the killing of six people and the wounding of 12 others – reminds us how fragile real democracy remains in the 224year of the Constitution.Stunned by the brutal sweep of the Arizona massacre, this is not the moment to leap to glib conclusions about the motivations of the man who fired the shots. Nor do I want to reprise the familiar debates over gun control or to demonize Giffords' political adversaries. There are too many facts that remain elusive (the first hours after the shooting were punctuated by incorrect rumors masquerading as news) to resort to partisan talking points.But we can glimpse what the future will bring – and there are valid reasons to fear that the traditions of congressional openness are in dire jeopardy. After the raucous Tea Party protests during the 2009 summer recess, some embattled House Democrats resorted to \\"virtual town meetings,\\" which were little more than disembodied telephonic conference calls. The next step will be that instead of \\"Congress on Your Corner,\\" incumbents in both parties will offer something akin to \\"Congress on Your Computer.\\"The acidic anger corroding our political system is premised on the belief that elected officials in Washington are arrogantly out of touch. But what will happen when representatives and senators begin to believe that they are risking their lives by appearing in public to answer voter questions? The inevitable result will be new barriers (portable metal detectors, omnipresent security guards) standing between the political elites and the governed.Equally troubling will be the psychological effects on House members themselves as Congress gives way to the inevitable security mania. Although there is no way of proving it, I have long nurtured the belief that living inside a protective bubble exaggerates the self-importance of public officials. If everyone must be screened and frisked before being allowed to see a freshman congressman, it is easy to imagine how this legislator might soon believe that he is entitled to perks worthy of the court of Louis XIV.Living in an isolation chamber also has to eventually warp political judgment. Town meetings and more casual encounters with constituents allow congressmen to understand problems and public attitudes in a way that no poll or focus group can replicate. Right now in Washington – from the White House to the dome of the Capitol – too many public officials view voters as an abstraction and the political mood as a spreadsheet expressed in approval ratings and unemployment statistics.There is, of course, one subset of Americans who will always have personal access to senators and congressmen: wealthy campaign donors. The more time that legislators spend raising money in Park Avenue living rooms – and the less they see their constituents face-to-face – the easier it becomes to believe that creating tax breaks for the rich is the major purpose of government.A few months after the 9/11 attacks, I visited the Knesset in Israel. What haunted me as I went from interview to interview was the emptiness of the hallways since, because of security concerns, there was almost no one there who was not on official business.Coming back to America – even an America emotionally scarred by the terrorist attacks – I reveled in the vibrant openness of the corridors of the congressional office buildings as foot-sore tourists, high-priced lobbyists, Westerners wearing bolo ties, Hassidic rabbis, and earnest activists all participated in this daily pageant of democracy.This is a nation built around the principle that elected officials are not entitled to the trappings of royalty. When Grover Cleveland was president in the 1880s, it was still possible for a citizen to wander into the White House and leave a calling card in hopes of wangling an appointment. That laudable tradition still endures in congressional offices and when legislators go home to places like Tucson. ||||| The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at a congressional event on Saturday in Arizona has forced political leaders to confront a pair of chilling realities: The line between politics and violence has become less clear, and their need to be accessible to their constituents carries physical risks. “The struggle members have is maintaining that balance of openness and accessibility with that real concern that there’s a freak out there that will do the unthinkable,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), whose office sits next to Giffords,’ told POLITICO. Text Size - + reset VIDEO: House colleagues react VIDEO: Post-shooting politics POLITICO 44 Indeed, while lawmakers have been increasingly concerned in recent years that virulent rhetoric would escalate into violence, many of them have struggled to calibrate a response that neither ignores the problem nor encourages it. As Giffords battled to survive the bullet fired through her brain, it was abundantly clear Saturday that no one in politics can afford to take the prospect of violence lightly: When lawmakers say they are apprehensive about a public backlash against their actions, their fear is now no longer limited to losing their next race. “We can be shot down in our district, but we can also be shot walking over to the Capitol,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) told POLITICO in an interview Saturday night. “We have a lot of people outside who appear to be fragile emotionally. So we don’t know when one will walk up and shoot us down. We’re vulnerable, and there’s no real way to protect us.” A message sent from Sergeant at Arms Bill Livingood to House members and aides Saturday implicitly underscored Waters’ point. The security advice from Livingood: “[I]mmediately report circumstances that appear suspicious, and if you are scheduled to be in a public forum (town hall meetings, rallies, etc.), and feel uncertain about your safety, immediately contact the U.S. Capitol Police Threat Assessment Section or the Sergeant at Arms.” For most of the past two years — a period of economic distress and political tumult — lawmakers and their aides have struggled to understand and control voter antipathy toward public officials, which hit a fevered pitch during debate over the new health care law during the last Congress. “We have seen this country go through these things during times of great stress,” Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) said in an interview Saturday night. Recalling that then Sen. Lyndon Johnson was spat upon in Dallas a few years before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated there in 1963, Dingell expressed concern not only about the escalation of political intimidation but also said he is “particularly troubled when I hear people in high public office urge violence.” The rhetoric of the last campaign certainly had its controversial flourishes. During her challenge to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Republican nominee Sharron Angle raised the prospect of “2nd amendment remedies.”. And freshman Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) once said that citizens should be “well armed” because the government can be tyrannical. Dingell said it’s incumbent upon citizens, led by political figures, to reject violence. “The American people have to say this is simply unacceptable,” he said, adding that “as public officials we’re expected to lead” on that. ||||| Other lawmakers are still assessing the situation. “Our office has never considered having security for any Alabama public events in the past but this horrific tragedy definitely makes us think about it,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) in a statement. Text Size - + reset Other ideas to best prevent another shooting from occurring flew today among lawmakers and party officials as Washington continued to real from yesterday’s shooting. The shooting might have been prevented had a police officer been there to stop the shooter, Howard Dean said Sunday, suggesting that local law enforcement could be used as a cheap means of protection when lawmakers visit their districts. “You don’t have to be trained the same way the Capitol Police and the Secret Service are,” Dean, the former governor of Vermont, said on MSNBC. “Had there been a local Tucson police officer at the scene, that might have made the difference.” Rep. Mike Capuano (D-Mass.) says he’s not changing his lifestyles – even if Capitol security changes. “Even if they gave us each a body guard many of us wouldn’t take it, including myself,” said Capuano, who installed a home security system in his Massachusetts home the year he was elected to Congress. “The Capitol is pretty secure as far as I know, but when you’re out in the street there’s really not much you can do. We all know there nuts out there.” A spokeswoman for U.S. Capitol Police said this morning that the department is still advising members to take “reasonable and prudent precautions” and remain on heightened alert with a “robust” officer presence around the Capitol. “There are no immediate or actionable threats to members or the Capitol complex,” Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer told POLITICO. In the meantime, Capitol security officials are actively examining how to increase security for members, he said. “We are reviewing our methods by which we can support and make more secure the members and their staff as they go about their business,” Gainer said. “The shooting in Tucson is indirectly related to Capitol in an obvious way, some of the victims are members of our community. The Capitol remains on its continued state of readiness.” A conference call is scheduled today with U.S. Capitol Police, the House Sergeant at Arms Office and House members and spouses. ||||| Already, people are pointing fingers at Sarah Palin and her \\"target map\\" for fostering the tragedy in Arizona—but Howard Kurtz says military terminology has been part of politics for ages. I hate to say this, but the blame game is already under way. It began within hours of Saturday's horrifying shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and nearly 20 others, even before the gunman was identified. Political Target Map as seen on Sarah Palin's website. Inset: Sarah Palin and Gabrielle Giffords (AP Photo) One of the first to be dragged into this sickening ritual of guilt by association: Sarah Palin. Last March, the former Alaska governor posted a map on her Facebook page with crosshair targets representing 20 Democratic lawmakers she was singling out for defeat after they voted for President Obama's health care plan. One of them was Giffords. Palin, who touts her caribou-hunting heritage, also tweeted, \\"Don't retreat, RELOAD!\\" This kind of rhetoric is highly unfortunate. The use of the crosshairs was dumb. But it's a long stretch from such excessive language and symbols to holding a public official accountable for a murderer who opens fire on a political gathering and kills a half-dozen people, including a 9-year-old girl. On her Facebook page, Palin offered her \\"sincere condolences\\" to Giffords and the others who were shot, saying that \\"on behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.\\" This isn't about a nearly year-old Sarah Palin map; it's about a lone nutjob who doesn't value human life. Liberals were quick to denounce Palin at the time of the map posting. And after Giffords' Tucson office was vandalized that same month, the Democratic congresswoman told MSNBC, \\"We're on Sarah Palin's targeted list. But the thing is, the way she has it depicted it has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. And when people do that, they've got to realize there are consequences to that action.\\" Giffords had every right to ask Palin and others to tone it down. But is it now fair for the rest of us to tie Palin to the accused gunman, Jared Lee Loughner? Let's be honest: Journalists often use military terminology in describing campaigns. We talk about the air war, the bombshells, targeting politicians, knocking them off, candidates returning fire or being out of ammunition. So we shouldn't act shocked when politicians do the same thing. Obviously, Palin should have used dots or asterisks on her map. But does anyone seriously believe she was trying to incite violence? Palin seemed to pull back in a subsequent campaign appearance for her former running mate, John McCain. \\"We know violence isn't the answer,\\" she said. \\"When we take up our arms, we're talking about our vote.\\" But she also mocked the criticism as politically correct, using her Facebook platform to apply the same language to basketball's Final Four: \\"To the teams that desire making it this far next year: Gear up! In the battle, set your sights on next season's targets! From the shot across the bow—the first second's tip-off—your leaders will be in the enemy's crosshairs, so you must execute strong defensive tactics.\\" A fellow Arizona Democrat, Rep. Raul Grijalva, said that the Palin “apparatus” shares responsibility for creating a climate of extremism. \\"Both Gabby and I were targeted in the apparatus in that cycle [saying] these people are 'enemies,’” Grivjalva told Mother Jones’s David Corn. He added: “The Palin express better look at their tone and their tenor.” And MSNBC's Keith Olbermann made the link even more explicit on Saturday night: \\"If Sarah Palin, whose website put and today scrubbed bullseye targets on 20 representatives including Gabby Giffords, does not repudiate her own part in amplifying violence and violent imagery in politics, she must be dismissed from politics.\\" Of course, some rhetoric is deliberately incendiary. U.S. District Judge John Roll, one of those shot and killed in Tucson, had ruled in 2009 that a lawsuit by illegal immigrants against an Arizona rancher could go forward. Afterward, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said that talk radio shows fanned the flames and prompted hundreds of calls to the judge, some of them threatening. \\"They said, 'We should kill him. He should be dead,'\\" Gonzales told the Arizona Republic. The act of transforming tragedy into political fodder has deep roots in American history. After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, President Bill Clinton attacked \\"the purveyors of hatred and division\\" for \\"reckless speech,\\" saying the nation's airwaves were too often used \\"to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other. They spread hate, they leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable.\\" Rush Limbaugh, who had tangled with Clinton, responded that \\"liberals intend to use this tragedy for their own political gain.\\" He blamed \\"many in the mainstream media\\" for \\"irresponsible attempts to categorize and demonize those who had nothing to do with this.\\" |||||","output":"A long time ago, some people in America were not happy with how things were going, so they formed a group called the Tea Party. They thought the government was doing bad things, like taking away their freedom. Some people in this group, like Sharron Angle and Rick Barber, talked about fighting back. They used words like \\"tyranny\\" and \\"socialism\\" to make other people angry and scared. Being angry and scared can make people want to fight back too. But sometimes, when people are too angry, they use words that sound like they want to actually fight or hurt other people. In politics, that's not good. It can scare people and make them think about doing dangerous things. People like Sarah Palin and Michael Steele have used words that might accidentally make others think it's okay to hurt politicians they don't like. But they don't really mean it that way. They just want people to vote and make their voices heard. Now, some people are worried that all this angry talk could lead to more violence. The shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords made everybody think about how their words can matter. It's important for politicians to use words that help them share their ideas and make changes, but not to scare or hurt other people. So, talking about politics should be a discussion with different opinions, but we should remember to listen, learn, and be respectful to each other."},{"instruction":"Foods that are claimed to be negative in calories are mostly low-calorie fruits and vegetables such as celery, grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple, lettuce, broccoli, and cabbage.

Wear sunscreen. Wear protective clothing.","output":"Title: Defending Your Skin: Comprehensive Steps to Avoid Harmful UV Exposure Introduction: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun, poses serious health risks to human beings. Prolonged and unprotected exposure to UV radiation can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, sunburn, eye damage, and suppression of the immune system. With the rapid depletion of the ozone layer, the risk of harmful UV exposure has escalated. While sunlight plays a crucial role in nurturing our health and well-being, it is imperative to take appropriate measures to avoid the negative impacts of UV exposure. This article will discuss how to shield oneself from harmful UV rays by wearing sunscreen, using protective clothing, and adopting other preventive practices. 1. Wear Sunscreen: Sunscreen acts as the primary line of defense against the harmful effects of UV exposure. It is essential to choose a sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection, which shields the skin against both UVA and UVB radiation. UVA rays are known to trigger aging and may contribute to the development of skin cancers, while UVB rays are the primary cause of sunburn. (a) How to choose the right sunscreen: - Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30, which will block 97% of UVB radiation. - Look for the terms \\"broad-spectrum\\" or \\"UVA/UVB protection\\" on the label to ensure all-around protection from both UVA and UVB rays. - Consider water-resistant sunscreens if engaging in water-based activities or if excessive sweating is anticipated. (b) How to apply sunscreen correctly: - Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before stepping out into the sun. - Use generous amounts of sunscreen and cover all exposed areas, including the face, neck, ears, and top of the feet. - Reapply sunscreen every two hours or after swimming, sweating, or towel-drying. - Do not forget to apply lip balm with SPF for additional protection. 2. Wear Protective Clothing: UV-protective clothing is another essential component in the defense against harmful solar radiation. Incorporate the following into your outfits when venturing outdoors: (a) Long-sleeved shirts and pants: Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to cover maximum skin area, minimizing direct UV exposure. Opt for tightly woven fabrics that prevent UV rays from penetrating the material and reaching the skin. (b) Hats with wide brims: A hat with a 3-inch or larger brim protects your face, neck, and ears from direct exposure. Select a hat made from a tightly woven material that does not allow sunlight to penetrate. (c) UV-protective sunglasses: Invest in UV-protective sunglasses that shield your eyes and the delicate skin surrounding them from UVA and UVB rays. Look for sunglasses that block 99-100% of UV radiation and meet the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) UV protection standards. (d) UPF clothing: UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) clothing is designed to block a significant percentage of the sun's rays. Choose clothing with a UPF rating of 30 or higher, which will block at least 96% of UV radiation. 3. Additional Strategies: (a) Seek shade: Whenever possible, seek shade under trees, umbrellas, or other structures providing a safe refuge from direct sunlight. (b) Avoid peak hours: Limit your sun exposure during peak hours (10 AM – 4 PM), as this is when UV radiation levels are at their highest. (c) Stay vigilant on cloudy days: Cloud cover does not provide complete protection from UV radiation, as about 80% of rays can penetrate through the clouds. Do not drop your guard and continue implementing the above precautions. Conclusion: Minimizing the risks of harmful UV exposure is critical for maintaining overall health, preventing skin damage and reducing the likelihood of skin cancer development. By conscientiously wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and practicing additional preventive measures, it is possible to enjoy outdoor activities while safeguarding your skin and overall health from the harmful effects of UV radiation."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...where does tap water in london come from??","output":"To answer the question about where tap water in London comes from, I will follow these steps: 1.

The term 'Jaraj' might be used as a pejorative against a specific person or group but without any explicit context, it's hard to determine the full intended meaning here. The post seems to express some form of negativity or derision directed towards a person or group, but it does not openly express hate or encourages violence. However, we are asked to classify the post into two cases: personal or non-personal. \\"Personal\\" usually refers to insults or derogatory remarks made directly against an individual. \\"Non-personal\\" would involve derogatory comments made towards a group or community. The classification of the post largely depends on whether 'Jaraj' is being used to describe a characteristic inherent to a single person or a wider group. If 'Jaraj' refers to a specific person, this is a personal attack, but if 'Jaraj' referrers to a group or community of people, then it's a non-personal attack. Given the information provided, it seems that the post leans more towards being a \\"personal\\" classification, as it appears to be directed towards an individual (\\"If you were not a Jaraj\\").

Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence - Although both sentences are related, the first sentence does not necessarily imply that Time celebrated the novelist, specifically for their publication. It is possible that Time simply raves about the novelist and puts them on the cover, but this does not require the form of a celebration, and the reason for their celebration is not explicitly mentioned in the first sentence.

Sometimes cats and dogs may not like each other at first, but don't worry - with some patience and fun steps, we can help them become friends. Are you ready? Let's get started! Step 1: Let the cat (the kitty friend) set the pace. Our kitty friend is usually a bit more shy than our doggy friend. They might feel scared because they don't know the doggy well yet. So, we have to make sure that the cat feels safe and comfy while meeting the dog. Letting the kitty friend take their time to explore and move closer to the dog will make them feel secure. It's like how we make friends, we have to wait and get to know each other before we become best buddies. Step 2: Keep your dog (the doggy friend) on a loose leash. To help our doggy friend stay calm and give them the freedom to move, we'll use a long, loose leash. This will help the doggy feel happy while making sure they don't chase or scare the kitty friend. Remember, we want them to feel safe and be friends! Step 3: Be ready to react if your doggy tries to chase the kitty. Sometimes, our doggy friends get very excited and may want to play with the kitty right away. But they might play too rough! If you see your doggy friend moving too fast or trying to chase the kitty, gently hold the leash and guide the doggy to stop. This way, we can protect our kitty friend and continue with their nice and slow introduction. Step 4: Continue this practice for a few weeks. Becoming friends takes time! Just like how we make new friends at school, our doggy and kitty friends need time to get comfortable with each other. So, we'll keep practicing these steps every day for a few weeks, and they will learn that they can be friends without being scared or rough with each other. Step 5: When you feel absolutely confident, take your dog off the leash. After a few weeks of helping our doggy and kitty friends practice, we'll start to see that they are getting along better! When you're sure they are happy, safe, and calm together, we can let the doggy off the leash. Be sure to watch them carefully to make sure they continue to play gently and don't hurt our kitty friend. Now, you're all set! It's time to use these steps to help your doggy and kitty friends become the bestest buddies ever. And remember, always be kind and patient with them as they learn.

So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere.

A:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer raises several concerns about the novel, \\"Water for Elephants,\\" that potential readers may find significant. The most prominent issues mentioned in the review pertain to the underdeveloped characters, a potentially unsatisfying ending, and the excessive use of profanity and graphic sexual content. Firstly, the reviewer makes a brief mention of the shallow characters and implausible ending, which are not the focus of the review, but still indicate dissatisfaction. Although the reviewer does not want to repeat what has already been said, this statement establishes a negative tone when considering the quality of the plot and character depth. Secondly, the reviewer emphasizes their discomfort with the use of profanity in the book. They specifically mention the frequent use of the F-word, which may deter potential readers who are sensitive to such language. By issuing a \\"red flag\\" warning for this element, the reviewer implies that people who share their aversion to profanity might not enjoy the book. Thirdly, the critique of the novel’s graphic sexual content also casts the product in an unflattering light. According to the reviewer, the explicit sexual content feels gratuitous, as if the author was merely trying to shock and titillate readers. The reviewer also argues that the inclusion of detailed sexual behavior takes away from the development of more pertinent aspects, such as relationships and motives. Despite acknowledging that there is an interesting storyline within the novel, the reviewer ultimately suggests that the book’s negative aspects—underdeveloped characters, profanity, and explicit sexual content—detract from the overall reading experience. Accordingly, the portrayal of \\"Water for Elephants\\" in this review is mainly unflattering, likely deterring potential readers who share the reviewer's concerns."},{"instruction":"Where is bacteria likely to be slimy?

This led to increased effectiveness of bombing operations, particularly in large-scale bombardment missions. Curtis E. LeMay is associated with the development and implementation of this tactical formation. LeMay, an influential general in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, served as a commander of bomber operations in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war. Known for his innovative tactics and strategic vision, LeMay was instrumental in transforming the U.S. strategic bombing strategy and tactics. His leadership and strategic tweaks to formation and bombing procedures led to the development of various formations including the \\"Combat Box\\", which improved the accuracy, efficiency, and survival rate of bomber groups in hostile environments. It allowed for increased bomb concentration over the targeted area while enhancing the defensive capabilities of bombers against enemy fighters. LeMay's strategy was also significant from a logistical point of view. By implementing the Combat Box formation, the need for extensive escort fighter protection was reduced. The formation itself provided significant defensive firepower, enhancing the bombers' ability to protect themselves and reducing the need for extra fighter guard. The Combat Box was so successful that it was adapted and evolved throughout the later stages of the war and was also adopted by the British Royal Air Force's Bomber Command. In conclusion, Curtis E.

Which country withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in 1968?","output":"To answer this question accurately, I will follow these steps: 1. Understand the question: The question is asking about a country that withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in 1968. 2. Warsaw Pact context: The Warsaw Pact was a political and military alliance formed in 1955 between countries in Eastern Europe, led by the Soviet Union. 3. Research: I will check reliable sources of information focusing on the historical events surrounding the Warsaw Pact to identify the specific country that withdrew from the Pact in 1968. 4. Evaluate information: I will verify the accuracy and reliability of the information obtained to ensure the correct answer is provided. After carrying out the above steps, I have found that: In 1968, no country officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact. However, the user might be referring to Czechoslovakia. In this year, the country underwent a reform movement known as the Prague Spring, when it tried to implement communist reforms with \\"socialism with a human face,\\" which ultimately led to an invasion by Warsaw Pact nations (led by the Soviet Union) to halt the reforms. Although Czechoslovakia did not officially withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, it went through significant political changes in an attempt to assert autonomy from the Soviet Union within the Warsaw Pact.

The 14-month-old was crying as he had nappy rash. Article:","output":"Title: A Heart-Wrenching Tale: The Situation That Led to Nathan Allen's Actions & The Importance of Parenting Support Introduction Every parent knows that children at times can test their patience, and often, seemingly small issues can escalate into terrible situations. This tragic incident involving Nathan Allen and young Fletcher is a prime example of how lack of support and proper guidance can lead to damaging actions in a moment of loss of self-control. The Incident Nathan Allen, a father struggling with his parental responsibilities, succumbed to his boiling frustration and forcefully brought both of his fists down on his 14-month-old son Fletcher's abdomen. The child had been continuously crying due to the discomfort caused by his nappy rash, which is a common irritation experienced by babies wearing wet or soiled diapers for a prolonged period. Nappy rash is rarely considered a serious issue, with proper care and attention, and could have been easily addressed by a simple change of diapers or application of an appropriate rash cream. However, Nathan's inability to handle the situation led to dire consequences for young Fletcher. Delving Deeper Into The Problem Nathan's actions that tragic day do not merely signal a problem with anger management - it emphasizes the severe lack of support and guidance available to parents in need. There is an intrinsic longing for education and support in society when it comes to raising a child, and many daunting obstacles await both new and experienced parents alike. The feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and even deep regret in the face of overwhelming responsibilities are not uncommon, and this incident involving Nathan Allen serves as a stark reminder of the importance of seeking help when needed. With Nathan's momentary loss of control came a resounding cry for the need for increased awareness in communities about resources that provide assistance to struggling parents. These resources can help identify early warning signs of escalating issues and offer strategies to cope more effectively. Importance Of Parenting Support To prevent devastating events like these, it is essential to understand the critical need for parenting support. There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to raising a child, and support systems should be readily available to parents in need, tailored to their specific concerns and challenges. It is unquestionably more difficult for parents to navigate their stress, emotional and psychological well-being, without access to practical tools and compassionate guidance. Here are a few key areas where parenting support can make a significant difference: 1. Emotional Support - Support groups, therapists, and counselors can provide a safe space for parents to vent their frustrations, share their experiences, and offer mutual understanding and compassion. 2. Educational Support - Parenting seminars, workshops, and self-help resources can provide invaluable insights into effective techniques for handling different child-related issues, ranging from health concerns to discipline. 3. Financial Support - Many parents, especially those living below the poverty line, struggle with covering the costs of raising a child. It is essential for communities to offer financial assistance programs to ensure adequate care for children. 4. Social Support - Creating connections with other parents and community members is crucial in fostering a supportive network that can offer advice and a helping hand during challenging times. Conclusion In conclusion, while Nathan Allen's actions towards Fletcher are not commendable, the incident does expose the crucial need for a comprehensive support network for parents in our society. By investing in accessible and effective parenting support resources, these grave situations can be avoided, giving parents the tools to better navigate their journey in raising happy, healthy, and well-adjusted children."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Petra and Ahmed like a bakery on North Main Street.

Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: What did the author mean by saying \\"just like a cat has nine lives\\" when he talked about Arafat? - Arafat is as clever as a cat. - Arafat can live as long as a cat. - Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives. - Arafat should have died for at least 8 times.

Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Purple symbolizes the color of royalty and was often worn by kings and queens.\\" Options: - yes - no","output":"Let's analyze the sentence step-by-step to determine if it makes sense: 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"purple,\\" which is a color. 2. The sentence states that purple \\"symbolizes the color of royalty.\\" This is a factually accurate statement because purple has historically been associated with royalty due to the rarity and expense of purple dyes in the past. 3. Next, the sentence mentions that purple \\"was often worn by kings and queens.\\" This statement aligns with the symbolism of purple set forth in the beginning of the sentence. Kings and queens, as members of royalty, would have been more likely to wear purple as a symbol of their status. Given this analysis, my answer is: - yes The sentence makes sense, as it correctly notes that purple is symbolically associated with royalty and was often worn by kings and queens."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage.

Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and St Michael and All Angels...

The death rose to 26 Sunday morning as rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners who were still trapped underground, rescue headquarters said. Rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground, but chances for them to survive were very slim, said Du Bo, deputy chief of the rescue headquarters. \\"Based upon past experience, the remaining 11 miners could be buried in coal dust, so the survival chances are frail,\\" Du said. More than 2,500 tons of coal dust smothered the pit after the gas leak , which hampered the rescue, said Du. The gas outburst happened at 6:03 a.m. Saturday when 276 miners were working underground in the mine in Yuzhou City. A total of 239 workers escaped but 21 were found dead and 16 trapped. An initial investigation showed that 173,500 cubic meters of gas leaked out in the accident. Liu Wenbin, a deputy chief engineer of the company that owns the mine, was in the pit when the accident happened.

The head of Ukraine's security service has told the BBC there is proof the men are Russian troops. Russia said the two men were no longer serving soldiers. Rebels in eastern Ukraine said the men were policemen from Ukraine's Luhansk region. Vitaliy Naida, Ukraine's security chief, told BBC World News he was \\"absolutely positive\\" the men were officers from the GRU, the foreign military intelligence branch of Russia's army. \\"We have battle dress uniform, we have automatic rifles that are produced only in the Russian Federation only for Special Forces' use,\\" he said. Mr Naida said the men were part of a group of 220 GRU officers deployed to Luhansk on 2 May. The others have now returned to Russia, he said. \\"We have already started a criminal case for a terrorist act,\\" Mr Naida said. In a video, one of the captured men said he was a sergeant from the central Russian city of Togliatti, where an elite intelligence unit for the Russian army is based. The video has not been independently verified. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's ministry of defence, said the two men were not serving soldiers at the time they were detained. Mr Konashenkov said the two men had been mistreated by Ukrainian special forces who had \\"beat convenient testimony out of them\\". \\"We are counting on the Ukrainian leadership to show good sense,\\" he said, adding that he hoped the two men would be \\"released as soon as possible\\". The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation. Moscow denies the claims, but says that a number of Russian nationals are fighting with the separatists in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as volunteers. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister, told reporters that Russian officers had tried to kill the two men as soon as they were detained. Mr Klimkin declined to give more details. More than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting that began in April 2014 when rebels seized large parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Me and Orson Welles is a 2008 British-American period drama film directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay, and Claire Danes. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to perform in Orson Welles's groundbreaking stage adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in London and New York and on the Isle of Man in February, March and April 2008, and was released in the United States on November 25, 2009, and the United Kingdom on December 4, 2009. Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. adapted the film's screenplay from Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old Arthur Anderson, who played Lucius in Welles' production) involved in the founding of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. After receiving funding from CinemaNX, a production company backed by the Isle of Man film fund, and an offer from Framestore Features to co-finance the film, Richard Linklater came on board to direct Me and Orson Welles. Zac Efron signed on as the lead in early January 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of Richard Samuels because \\"It's a completely different project than I've ever done before,\\" while Claire Danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest Sonja Jones in late January. In the theatre, Christian McKay had portrayed Orson Welles in the one-man play Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles at a number of venues, including the Edinburgh Festival and King's Head (London). He reprised the role in the U.S. at the 2007 \\"Brits Off Broadway\\" festival, where Linklater saw his performance and then cast McKay as Welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer. Me and Orson Welles underwent filming in the Isle of Man, Pinewood Studios, London and New York from February to April 2008. Filming in London commenced first in mid-February, before scenes in the Isle of Man were shot February 24-March 14, 2008, where filming locations included Gaiety Theatre and various other parts of Douglas. During filming in Douglas, Efron and Danes believe they sighted a ghost, or \\"supernatural\\" being, outside a window on set at Gaiety Theatre. Filming in Britain resumed in late March for six weeks at Pinewood Studios. Other locations included Crystal Palace Park, where a facade of New York's Mercury Theatre was set up for a scene. Actor James Tupper claimed that the best replica of an old New York theater was in England, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production crew only briefly visited New York; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects. Every exterior shot was filmed on a single street built at Pinewood Studios with a green screen at one end; different angles and slightly altered set designs were used between shots to make the street appear different each time.

The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. What is the relationship between 'luigi maglione' and 'bishop'? Answer:","output":"Luigi Maglione was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He did not hold the specific title of 'Bishop' in his own right. However, as a Cardinal, he was part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and held significant responsibilities within the Church, including serving as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death in 1944. In this capacity, he would have collaborated with bishops and other leaders within the Catholic Church, both within the Vatican and around the world. So, although he was not a bishop himself, Luigi Maglione held a prominent position within the Catholic Church and worked closely with bishops as part of his role."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake. Answer:","output":"Step 0: Tectonic plates under the Earth's crust begin to move or shift. Justification: The movement of tectonic plates creates stress and tension, which then leads to the formation of cracks in the Earth's crust. As the plates continue to move and apply pressure against the rocks, this initiates the subsequent steps in the process, eventually culminating in the release of seismic waves and the occurrence of an earthquake."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"Two young boys engage one another during a game of flag football.\\" is it true that \\"Two kids are playing flag football with others.\\"?. Teacher: Let's think:","output":"In the original sentence, \\"Two young boys engage one another during a game of flag football,\\" it describes two young boys participating in a flag football game. They are actively playing against each other, as suggested by the word \\"engage.\\" Now, let's analyze the provided statement: \\"Two kids are playing flag football with others.\\" This statement also indicates that two children are participating in a game of flag football. The term \\"kids\\" can be used interchangeably with \\"young boys\\" in this context. The main difference between the two sentences is that the original sentence specifically mentions the boys engaging with one another, while the provided statement implies that there may be more participants in the game, as it says \\"with others.\\" However, the original sentence does mention a \\"game\\" of flag football, which would typically involve more than just the two boys. From this analysis, we can conclude that the statement \\"Two kids are playing flag football with others\\" is essentially true in the context of the given sentence. Although the focus of the original sentence is on two boys engaging with one another, it does not negate the overall context of them participating in a game involving other players."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: Which name connects a town in the north of England, a prehistoric burial chamber and an American gangster?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key terms in the given question. - town in the north of England - prehistoric burial chamber - American gangster Step 2: Research the key terms to find links between them. - Town in the north of England: There are many towns in the north of England, so it requires narrowing down or finding a common link with the other key terms. - Prehistoric burial chamber: The prehistoric burial chamber of interest is West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire, England. However, this doesn't seem to directly connect with a town in the north of England. - American Gangster: Notable American gangsters include Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, and John Gotti. Step 3: Find connections between key terms. Through research and some knowledge of British colloquialisms, the connection is discovered: Scarface. - The town in the north of England: There is a town called Scafell in the north of England. \\"Scafell\\" sounds like \\"Scarface,\\" which could be the link. - Prehistoric burial chamber: West Kennet Long Barrow contains several human remains, all of whom were once believed to have had facial deformities. Although it is now known to be incorrect, local legends still state that some of the remains belonged to individuals with \\"scarred faces.\\" - American gangster: The nickname \\"Scarface\\" is widely associated with the notorious American gangster Al Capone.

He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man.

Question: suppose more satellites are built happens, how will it affect fewer rockets are needed. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The scenario presented mentions an increase in the number of satellites built, and the question asks how this would affect the number of rockets needed, as well as how the \\"perturbation\\" will influence this relationship. It is important to consider various factors and scenarios to provide a comprehensive answer. There are three possible outcomes: more effect, less effect, or no effect, depending on the specific circumstances. 1. More Effect: An increase in the number of satellites built could lead to greater demand for launches, thereby necessitating more rockets. This could be due to a higher demand for Earth observation and communication satellites, military applications, or scientific missions, among others. It could also be attributed to more countries aiming to establish their own space infrastructure. More need for satellite launches would effectively mean that more rockets are needed. In this scenario, the perturbation of building more satellites leads to a stronger effect on the requirement of rockets, and overall, increases the need for more rockets to put these satellites into orbit. 2. Less Effect: On the other hand, it is possible that advancements in technology could lead to a reduction in the need for rockets even with an increase in satellite production. For instance, if there are innovations in satellite technology that allow for smaller, more efficient satellites, it could result in the development of rockets capable of carrying multiple satellites at once. This would mean that the same number of rockets could deploy more satellites into orbit than before, thus reducing the overall number of rockets needed. Moreover, the reusability of rockets, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9, also plays a significant role in reducing the need for building new rockets for each satellite launch. If reusable rockets become the standard for launching satellites, the number of rockets needed may decrease even as the number of satellites built increases. In this scenario, the perturbation initially appears to have a greater effect on rockets, but technological advancements and reusable rocket technology might decrease the influence on the number of rockets needed. 3. No Effect: It is possible that an increase in the number of satellites built does not affect the number of rockets needed, particularly if the rate of satellite launch demand remains stable over time. This could occur if additional satellites serve as replacements for older, decommissioned satellites or if satellite production outpaces the ability of rocket manufacturers to produce launch vehicles. This scenario implies that the perturbation could have no clear influence on the second effect, as the existing demand for rockets is expected to persist in line with the satellite launch requirements. In conclusion, whether there is more effect, less effect, or no effect on the number of rockets needed depends on a variety of factors, including advancements in satellite and rocket technologies, the reusability of rockets, and market demand for satellite launches. The perturbation caused by building more satellites, therefore, can have different outcomes on the relationship between satellites and rockets, and these outcomes depend on the specific circumstances and underlying influencing factors."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Bird migration.","output":"Why do birds migrate to different places during different times of the year?"},{"instruction":"Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer. His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever. In the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant-garde to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of Flora Purim on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums , and Stanley Clarke on double bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior. Corea's composition \\"Spain\\" appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album Light as a Feather. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of recordings by Corea himself. These included an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999 and a collabration with vocalist Bobby McFerrin on the 1992 album Play. Corea usually performs \\"Spain\\" with a prelude based on Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain. In 1976, he issued My Spanish Heart, influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea's wife) and electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.

Article: TOKYO--Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan. Japan's space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep, monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter. Japan's space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter--primarily feeding photos, rather than original ideas --and provide astronauts with \\"comfort and companionship\\". Following up on US NASA's \\"Robonaut\\" R2 program, which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week, the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly, JAXA said in a statement. Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world's longest life expectancies. Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive means of monitoring the robot owner's health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality, JAXA said. \\"We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts,\\" said JAXA's Satoshi Sano. The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University. The NASA project has a humanlike head, hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members. The \\"Robonaut\\" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab. NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans. For now, the 2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab.

We have the equation: 44*b - 5*b = 8*b - 42*b + 4088 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the \\"b\\" terms on both sides: On the left side, we have 44*b - 5*b. When we subtract 5*b from 44*b, we get 39*b. On the right side, we have 8*b - 42*b. When we subtract 42*b from 8*b, we get -34*b. Now our equation looks like this: 39*b = -34*b + 4088 Next, let's move all the \\"b\\" terms to one side by adding 34*b to both sides: 39*b + 34*b = 4088 When we add 39*b and 34*b, we get 73*b.

For more than forty years, Gilbreth's career combined psychology with the study of scientific management and engineering. She also included her perspectives as a wife and mother in her research, writing, and consulting work. Gilbreth became a pioneer in what is now known as Industrial and organizational psychology. She helped industrial engineers recognized the importance of the psychological dimensions of work. In addition, she became the first American engineer ever to create a synthesis of psychology and scientific management. (Gilbreth introduced the concept of using psychology to study management at the Dartmouth College Conference on Scientific Management in 1911.) In addition to jointly running Gilbreth Incorporated, their business and engineering consulting firm, Lillian and Frank wrote numerous publications as sole authors, as well as co-authoring multiple books and more than fifty papers on a variety of scientific topics. However, in their joint publications Lillian was not always named as a co-author, possibly due to publishers' concerns about a female writer. Althhough her credentials included a doctorate in psychology, she is less frequently credited in their joing publications than her husband, who did not attend college. The Gilbreths were certain that the revolutionary ideas of Frederick Winslow Taylor would be neither easy to implement nor sufficient; their implementation would require hard work by engineers and psychologists to make them successful. The Gilbreths also believed that scientific management as formulated by Taylor fell short when it came to managing the human element on the shop floor.

Stream-of-consciousness Explanation: When we consider the characteristics of mammals and plants, we see that they belong to two different domains of life - animals and plants, respectively. Mammals, as animals, primarily obtain their energy through consuming other organisms, while plants primarily produce their own energy through a process called photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants and some algae that enables the absorption of light to carry out photosynthesis. It is the key factor that allows these organisms to capture and convert sunlight into energy in the form of glucose. Mammals, however, obtain their energy through cellular respiration, breaking down glucose molecules to release energy that powers their cellular functions. They consume other organisms, such as plants and other animals, as a source of this glucose. It is through these food sources that mammals also acquire some of the essential nutrients that they cannot produce on their own. One might wonder if there is any overlap in these biological strategies, and if any mammals have evolved the ability to produce chlorophyll and photosynthesize like plants do. However, upon researching the topic and examining the documented instances of known mammals, it is apparent that there are no mammals that can naturally produce chlorophyll or photosynthesize.

Hypothesis: The Stand: American Nightmares is a five-issue comic book miniseries written by Stephen King.","output":"Based on the given context, the hypothesis that 'The Stand: American Nightmares is a five-issue comic book miniseries written by Stephen King' is partially accurate. Although it does mention that Stephen King was overseeing the project, it does not explicitly state that King is the author of the comic series. Instead, the context suggests that the comic series is an adaptation of King's novel, The Stand. The key players involved in creating the comic book miniseries are actually different. The comic book series is written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, illustrated by Mike Perkins, and colored by Laura Martin. Thus, while the miniseries is based on Stephen King's novel, it is not directly written by him.

By Helen Lawson PUBLISHED: 12:00 EST, 10 June 2013 | UPDATED: 12:15 EST, 10 June 2013 Poor taste: The cafe named a sandwich after prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia in 1992 for his efforts to defeat them An Austrian cafe named sandwiches after victims of the Mafia - and sparked an international row. Italy's foreign ministry complained to Austrian authorities on Saturday about the Vienna pub's bad taste products. Customers of Don Panino can order a Giovianni Falcone, named after the prosecutor killed by a Mafia bombing in 1992. The sandwich is 'the greatest nemesis of the Mafia in Palermo but unfortunately grilled like a sausage'.","output":"The cafe owner, realizing the gravity of the mistake, issued an official apology and immediately removed the controversial sandwich from the menu. The matter was addressed with sensitivity, and a new sandwich with a different name was introduced to replace the inappropriate item. In order to make amends, the cafe announced that profits from its sales would be donated to a foundation dedicated to supporting the families of Mafia victims and to further the fight against organized crime. This gesture not only silenced the critics, but also garnered positive publicity for both the cafe and the anti-Mafia cause in Vienna. In response to the apology and the efforts undertaken by the cafe, the Italian foreign ministry and the families of the Mafia victims expressed their appreciation. A representative of the foundation dedicated to the cause praised the cafe owner's awareness and willingness to rectify the situation swiftly. Additionally, the incident triggered a broader conversation on the significance of respecting the memory of those who bravely fought against organized crime. The controversy prompted other establishments to revisit and reconsider the names and themes they employed in their own businesses, with business owners becoming more educated and sensitive to the meanings and potential impacts their choices could have on the wider public. This transformative experience not only resulted in more thoughtful and responsible practices but also highlighted the importance of cultural awareness in a diverse and interconnected world. Don Panino continued its operations with a new perspective on empathy and responsibility in business, successfully rebuilding its reputation within the local community and international visitors. The dented relationship between the Italian and Austrian authorities also mended as the two nations worked together to promote peace, understanding, and joint efforts against organized crime. In the end, the incident served as a valuable lesson for businesses and individuals alike, teaching a poignant lesson on the importance of cultural sensitivity, respect, and the power of genuine apologies in restoring reputations and relationships."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: Keep her out of the White House. Here is a hypothesis: Let her into the White House. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"A premise is an assumption or a basis on which an argument is founded. In this scenario, the premise states that \\"she\\" should be kept out of the White House. On the other hand, a hypothesis is an idea or explanation that can be tested via investigation. In this case, the hypothesis suggests to allow \\"her\\" into the White House. The premise and the hypothesis represent contradictory positions; thus, it is important to examine their compatibility and the logical consequences of accepting one or the other. To evaluate whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, let's first take a closer look at both statements. Premise: Keep her out of the White House The premise asserts that \\"she\\" should not be allowed into the White House. This could be based on various reasons, such as concerns about her character, qualifications, or political beliefs. The specific reasons for this statement are not given, but it is clear that there is a belief that it's not appropriate for her to enter the White House. Hypothesis: Let her into the White House The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that \\"she\\" should be allowed into the White House. This statement could be a proposal to test the consequences of such action, the evaluation of its merits, or an investigation into the potential benefits that could arise from being in the White House. Like the premise, the reasoning behind this statement is not provided. Now let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Logically, if the premise is true (i.e., that she should be kept out of the White House), then the opposite statement (i.e., allowing her into the White House) should be false, since both assertions are mutually exclusive. However, it's important to note that the truth of the premise does not inherently dictate the truth of the hypothesis. These two statements represent contrasting positions, and their validity should be evaluated independently. The truth of the premise only guarantees the falsity of the contradictory position if both statements cannot exist simultaneously. In conclusion, it is not possible to deduce that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Since the premise and the hypothesis represent conflicting positions, acknowledging one as true implies rejecting the other. Thus, if \\"Keep her out of the White House\\" is a valid and accurate statement, it does not immediately support the assertion of \\"Let her into the White House.\\" In this context, a more accurate outcome would be that if the premise is true, the opposing hypothesis would not be true, given that they fundamentally represent oppositional perspectives."},{"instruction":"His Eufaula Connection calls him back half an hour later.

Options are: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","output":"c). no The statement \\"He waited all day, and his Eufaula Connection never returned his call\\" does not hold true in this situation. According to the given information, the Eufaula Connection did, in fact, return his call half an hour later. The prompt does not mention anything about him waiting all day for the call to be returned. In this scenario, it appears that the individual was able to connect with the Eufaula Connection within a reasonably short amount of time (half an hour). As a result, waiting all day for a call that was never returned is not an accurate description of the events that took place. However, it is essential to remember that without more context, we can't make assumptions about other aspects of their communication. For example, we don't know if the Eufaula Connection provided any helpful information or if they made any agreements during their conversation. Also, we don't know if the individual had any other interactions with the Eufaula Connection later in the day. In conclusion, based on the provided details, the correct answer is c). no, as the Eufaula Connection did return the call half an hour later, and thus the statement \\"He waited all day, and his Eufaula Connection never returned his call\\" is not accurate in this case."},{"instruction":"Question 1: Does cinnamon help you lose weight?

The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \\"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\\" scientists say.

It is derived from the verb \\"chtít\\" which means \\"to want\\". In this context, \\"Chci\\" is conjugated in the first person singular form, which indicates the speaker is referring to oneself. 2. \\"you to leave\\" can be translated to \\"abys odešel\\". The word \\"abys\\" is a combination of the conjunction \\"aby\\" (meaning \\"in order that\\" or \\"so that\\") and the personal pronoun \\"ty\\" (meaning \\"you\\" in the nominative case, singular). In this context, we are using the second person singular form to refer to the person being asked to leave. The verb \\"odejít\\" means \\"to leave\\" or \\"to depart\\" in Czech. In this case, the verb \\"odejít\\" is conjugated in the past participle form to become \\"odešel\\" (masculine gender), \\"odešla\\" (feminine gender), or \\"odešlo\\" (neuter gender). Since there is no gender information about \\"Ag,\\" we can consider the most common masculine version \\"odešel.\\" 3. \\"Ag\\" remains the same as it is presumably a name or abbreviation which does not need to be translated. So, the complete translation would be \\"Chci, abys odešel, Ag.\\" (masculine), \\"Chci, abys odešla, Ag.\\" (feminine), or \\"Chci, abys odešlo, Ag.\\" (neuter). Without knowing the gender of \\"Ag,\\" it's best to use the masculine version as a default."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a sentence in Dutch, generate a new Dutch sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The police watchdog heard that the newly-elected crime commissioner might have made a mistake with the money they spent during the election. Money is important in elections because people need to let others know about their ideas and plans. They use money to make signs, travel, and spread the word in newspapers, TV, and even the internet. Just like how we save money to buy something special, it's important to know how much money was spent during an election. The police watchdog wants to know if the new crime commissioner was honest about their election expenses. They check if the numbers match the actual money spent, like when you count how many coins you have in your piggy bank. Being honest is important because it helps people trust the person they chose to protect them from crime.

Two of the major world religions, Protestantism and Islam, have significantly impacted various aspects of society, including politics, economics, and social life. To gain a better understanding of the religious landscape and the distribution of these faiths across the globe, it is crucial to explore and examine the percentages of people who claim to be adherents of these religious beliefs. In this article, we will delve into the differences in percentage points between those who claim to be Protestant and those who claim to be Muslim worldwide. Global Distribution of Religions: According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020, there are approximately 2.3 billion Christians, 1.9 billion Muslims, 1.2 billion people unaffiliated with any religion, and 1.1 billion Hindus making up the majority of the world's 7.8 billion people. Christianity is the largest religion, with Islam closely following behind as the second-largest religion in the world. Among Christians, there are varying denominations, with Protestantism being one of the most significant branches. Protestantism as a Branch of Christianity: Protestantism emerged during the 16th century as part of the Reformation movement led by Martin Luther and John Calvin. It is a diverse branch of Christianity that encompasses numerous denominations such as Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal, among others. Estimates suggest that there are about 800 million to 1 billion Protestants worldwide, accounting for roughly 11% to 13% of the global population. Islam as a Major World Religion: Islam was founded in the 7th century by the Prophet Muhammad in what is currently Saudi Arabia. As a religion, Islam emphasizes the belief in one God, Allah, and teaches that Muhammad is his final prophet. Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Quran, their holy book, and observe the Five Pillars of Islam as central tenets of their faith. Islam has two major branches – Sunni and Shia, with Sunni Muslims making up the majority (about 85-90%) of the Muslim population. The overall number of Muslims accounts for nearly 24% to 25% of the global population. Comparing the Number of Protestants and Muslims Worldwide: To determine the difference in percentage points between people claiming to be Protestant and those claiming to be Muslim, we must compare the percentages of each religious population as part of the global population. As previously mentioned, Protestants account for approximately 11% to 13%, while Muslims make up around 24% to 25% of the global population. Calculating the Difference in Percentage Points: Using the estimated percentage points for both religious populations (13% for Protestants and 25% for Muslims), we can calculate the difference in percentage points as follows: Difference = Percentage of Muslims - Percentage of Protestants Difference = 25% - 13% Difference = 12% Conclusion: Based on our analysis, approximately 12 percentage points more people claim to be Muslim than Protestant worldwide. This number indicates the presence of a more significant Muslim population globally and highlights the importance of understanding diverse religious beliefs and practices across various societies. It should be noted, however, that religious demographics can change over time due to various factors like fertility rates, migration, and religious conversions. Therefore, regularly updated data can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the demographics and distribution of religious populations around the world."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \\"Latinos\\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Let's start by understanding what a simple sentence is. A simple sentence is a sentence that contains a subject, a verb, and an object, and conveys a complete thought. The subject is the person, place, thing, or idea that performs the action or is being described. The verb is the action word or state of being that tells us what the subject is doing or how it is. The object is the noun or pronoun that is affected by the verb or receives the action. Now let's see how they all come together. In a simple sentence, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object. So, the structure of a simple sentence can be represented as \\"subject-verb-object\\" or SVO. An example of this would be \\"The dog chased the ball.\\" Here, \\"the dog\\" is the subject, \\"chased\\" is the verb, and \\"the ball\\" is the object. This sentence follows the SVO structure and conveys a complete thought. To further illustrate this, let's consider another example. \\"Samantha reads a book.\\" In this sentence, \\"Samantha\\" is the subject, \\"reads\\" is the verb, and \\"a book\\" is the object. Once again, the sentence follows the SVO structure, and it's easy to understand what's happening. So, the answer to the question of how a simple sentence with a subject, a verb, and an object is structured is: Sentence A: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Pieridae are a large family of butterflies with about 76 genera containing about 1,100 species, mostly from tropical Africa and tropical Asia with some varieties in the more northern regions of North America. Most pierid butterflies are white, yellow, or orange in coloration, often with black spots. The pigments that give the distinct coloring to these butterflies are derived from waste products in the body and are a characteristic of this family. - Dismorphia is a genus of butterflies in the subfamily Dismorphiinae . - Dismorphiinae, the mimic sulphurs, is a subfamily of butterflies from the family Pieridae.

Suitcase - If there isn't enough space, it could be that you're trying to pack items into a suitcase, and it can't accommodate everything. A bigger suitcase would solve this issue. 2. Box - Similarly to a suitcase, having a bigger box would allow for more space to store or transport items. It's a possible solution to the issue of not having enough space. 3. Sentence - Increasing the size of a sentence doesn't relate to the problem of not having enough space. Bigger sentences wouldn't solve the issue. 4. House - If you don't have enough space in your living situation, a bigger house could be the solution. It's relevant to the problem of not having enough space. 5. Paragraph - Like the sentence, enlarging a paragraph doesn't address the issue of not having enough space. A bigger paragraph wouldn't solve the problem. Based on the reasoning process, options 1, 2, and 4 (suitcase, box, and house) are all possible answers to the question. However, since we don't have enough context on the specific situation, we cannot definitively determine which one is the correct solution."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: The task is about translation from Telugu to English.

You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your powdered sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together....I think the answer is","output":"1. You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together. The correct method for creaming butter and sugar when making chocolate bread is the first option. This is because the process involves beating together softened room temperature butter with granulated sugar (not powdered sugar) until the mixture becomes light, fluffy, and pale in color. This method helps to create a smooth consistency and incorporates air into the batter, resulting in a lighter texture for the finished bread. Option 2 is incorrect because it suggests using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Powdered sugar, also known as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar, has a finer texture and is not typically used for creaming in baking recipes. It is more commonly used for icing, glazes, and other confectionery purposes. Using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar in a creaming method may result in a denser, less airy texture in the final product."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s.

These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41. Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in. When Adam and him play games together Chris also seems to lose more often now even though historically he has always been better. Which brother is likely experiencing a decline in strength, Adam or Chris? The answer is:","output":"Chris is likely experiencing a decline in strength. As described in the initial information provided, middle adulthood is a stage in life that typically ranges from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this period, individuals often begin to show physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Additionally, vision, strength, and reaction time may start to decline. Although Adam is still relatively young at 27, his older brother Chris, who is 41 years old, is already in the midst of middle adulthood. Consequently, Chris is more susceptible to experiencing the effects of aging, including the decline in strength, that are characteristic of this stage of life. The observation that Chris has lately started noticing gray hairs is an early indication that he is showing signs of aging. Moreover, when playing games with Adam, Chris seems to lose more often even though he has always been the better player in the past. This might be attributed to a decline in Chris' reaction time, vision, and strength, which often deteriorate during middle adulthood. Although each person ages differently and at varying rates, it is reasonable to assume that Chris, being in the middle adulthood stage, is more likely to be experiencing a decline in strength compared to his younger brother Adam."},{"instruction":"Question: A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. The traveler drank 32 ounces of water. 2. His camel drank seven times as much as he did, so the camel drank 32 ounces x 7 = 224 ounces. 3. Together, they drank 32 ounces (traveler) + 224 ounces (camel) = 256 ounces. 4. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so to find out how many gallons they drank altogether, we need to divide the total ounces by the number of ounces per gallon: 256 ounces ÷ 128 ounces/gallon = 2 gallons. So, the traveler and his camel drank 2 gallons of water altogether."},{"instruction":"A driver travels 30 miles per hour for 3 hours and 25 miles per hour for 4 hours to deliver goods to a town every day from Monday to Saturday. How many miles does the driver travel in a week? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. To find the total miles traveled in a week, we need to first find the total miles traveled per day. 2. To find the total miles traveled per day, we need to calculate the miles traveled for each speed (30 mph and 25 mph) and then add them together. 3. We know that distance = speed × time, so we can use this formula to find the miles traveled at each speed. 4. At 30 mph, the driver travels for 3 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled at this speed = 30 × 3 = 90 miles. 5. At 25 mph, the driver travels for 4 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled at this speed = 25 × 4 = 100 miles. 6. Now, to find the total miles traveled per day, we add the distances calculated in step 4 and step 5: 90 + 100 = 190 miles. 7. Since the driver travels these distances from Monday to Saturday, i.e., 6 days a week, we need to multiply the daily distance by 6 to find the miles traveled in a week. 8. Total miles traveled in a week = 190 (daily distance) × 6 (days) = 1140 miles. So, the driver travels 1140 miles in a week."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In order to find the actual increase in population, we can use the 2010 population figure and work backwards to estimate the 2000 population. Let 'x' represent the population of Oklahoma City in 2000. Then, the population increased by 14.6% from 2000 to 2010, which can be represented mathematically as: x + 0.146x = 579,999 Combining the 'x' terms, we get: 1.146x = 579,999 Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.146: x = 579,999 / 1.146 x ≈ 505,547 Using this calculation, the estimated population of Oklahoma City in 2000 was approximately 505,547. To determine the population growth from 2000 to 2010, we simply subtract the 2000 population from the 2010 population: Population growth = 2010 population - 2000 population Population growth = 579,999 - 505,547 Population growth ≈ 74,452 So, Oklahoma City's population grew by approximately 74,452 people from 2000 to 2010."},{"instruction":"Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult that return home but changed in some way.

Initially, these devices were designed purely as a means for voice communication. However, the functionality and purpose of mobile devices took a monumental shift with the introduction of Internet connectivity. Nowadays, smartphones have become an integral tool in our daily lives, providing a plethora of services beyond making calls and sending messages. Modern-day smartphones are equipped with powerful processors, high-resolution cameras, sizable storage capacities, and a wide array of applications, transforming them into efficient multi-functional devices. They have a significant role in instant messaging, video conferencing, entertainment, online shopping, banking, navigation, and so many other areas. They have consequently reduced the need for stand-alone devices like GPS, calculator, music player, camera etc. Furthermore, they have brought a significant contribution to digital education and health services. Hypothesis: The prevalence and advancements in smartphone technology are contributing to a decrease in the popularity and necessity of stand-alone devices such as MP3 players, digital cameras, and GPS devices. The continued evolution of smartphone technology will likely render these devices obsolete as all their functionalities can be replicated on a smartphone. This trend will continue as smartphones continue to evolve and become more technologically advanced, leading to an all-encompassing device that can perform a multitude of functions. Eventually, our reliance on multiple devices might get entirely replaced by our dependence on the multi-functional smartphone in the near future. Similarly, along with the decline of stand-alone devices, traditional methods of learning and healthcare can expect to face considerable transformation as mobile applications and digital platforms become more commonplace and widely accepted in these sectors."},{"instruction":"The Islamic State has set up terror training camps in Libya after the U.S. admitted that more than one hundred militants have gathered in the country.

Western countries have been increasingly worried that Libya's political turmoil could provide fertile ground for Islamic extremists, but General David Rodriguez ruled out military action on the 'nascent' camps in the immediate future. Scroll down for video. The group has largely focused on Iraq and is currently fighting for control of Kobane in Syria but there are fears they are spreading into North Africa. The head of US Africa Command told reporters at the Pentagon: 'They put training camps out there', referring to ISIS who have seized territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria this year in a brutal and swift offensive of beheadings and forced religious conversions. 'ISIS has begun its efforts over in the east out there to introduce some people over there. 'But we'll have to just continue to monitor and watch that carefully in the future to see what happens or whether it grows on unabated.' He described the IS activity in eastern Libya as 'very small' but added that there were 'around a couple hundred' militants present at the camps, with US forces continuing to track the area. The United States has been waging an air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but when asked if the training camps in Libya were a potential target for American forces, Mr Rodriguez replied: 'No, not right now.' The four-star general said it appeared the ISIS militants in Libya were not volunteers coming from outside the country but militia members who had shifted their loyalty to the jihadist group. His comments came after the US government and European allies voiced 'grave concern' over mounting violence and civil unrest in Libya. ISIS has already seized huge swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, including the town of Raqqa, pictured. Experts have warned that ISIS has gained a foothold in the eastern town of Derna, exploiting the chaos that has engulfed the North African state. Libya has been plagued by instability since the overthrow of autocratic leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently boasted of vows of allegiance from militants in the country. Analysts say a number of factions in Derna have pledged loyalty to the group, but it remains unclear how much support they enjoy. ISIS, which aims to establish an Islamic caliphate across the region, is the prime target of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. The group has attracted a wave of global revulsion after a series of horrific executions of Western hostages filmed and released online, as well as gruesome videos depicting the beheadings of Syrian and Iraqi forces. While largely based in Iraq and Syria, the IS organization has also attracted pledges of allegiance from militant groups in Egypt, with the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partisans of Jerusalem) group last month vowing support for the group.

By Larisa Brown, Defence Reporter for The Daily Mail. More British troops will be sent to help the Iraqi security forces as part of a large-scale mission to defeat Islamic State jihadists. Military trainers will teach the Iraqi army how to counter deadly roadside bombs as the British Army steps up its role in the country, leading to claims of ‘mission creep’. They will join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. Details are yet to be finalised but an announcement is expected in the coming days. Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger told the Defence Select Committee yesterday: ‘The training and support that we are providing has been requested by both the Kurds and central Iraqi Government. 'The Americans will see the establishment of four big training bases - one of which will be in Erbil. 'As part of that we see ourselves delivering niche specialist training in the area which is much needed, particular in IEDs. 'We are still scoping the exact nature of that but we hope to have some concrete proposals in the coming days.' He added: 'We are sending the reconnaissance forces out there to ensure that at the time when are training is needed we will be able to deliver it.’ In terms of numbers, they were still looking at both ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ options, he said. Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – have been asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge. The deputy chief of defence staff said British forces were also looking at other training possibilities as part of the UK’s contribution to a ‘large scale venture’ in training anti- Islamic State forces. He added: 'I think importantly it is demand led… we are delivering the type of training that these forces have asked for and need.’ Hundreds of British forces will also be sent to join American troops in training thousands of Syrian moderates outside the country. Defence sources said both Saudi Arabia and Jordan could host the training grounds but details are yet to be finalised. Peter Watkins, Director General of Security Policy, denied the further deployment of UK forces to ‘advise and train’ Iraqi security forces was ‘mission creep’. He told MPs: ‘Whatever we do has to be guided by the objectives we set out at the first place. 'I think if we remain guided by the objectives we can avoid mission creep.’ Lt Gen Messenger said air strikes had helped demoralise Islamic State –but had forced the extremist fighters to change tactics. He said: ‘The effect on the morale of both those organisations has been significantly enhanced by those air strikes.’ There had been an ‘equivalent reduction’ in the morale of IS, who were now using guerrilla tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs). ‘They were much more out in the open and even held military parades in certain areas’ Lt Gen Messenger said. ‘That has stopped. They are resorting to more asymmetric tactics, including the use of IEDs. They are using quite extensive countermeasures to avoid them being struck, moving at night, using the weather, avoiding grouping in big areas.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\"). A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\"). - Hamish Hamilton Limited was a British book publishing house , founded in 1931 eponymously by the half - Scot half - American Jamie Hamilton ( Hamish is the vocative form of the Gaelic ' Seamus ' ( meaning James ) , James the English form -- which was also his given name , and Jamie the diminutive form ) .

Here is a hypothesis: Think about all the stupid things. Here are the options: +yes. +it is not possible to tell. +no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to address this question, let's analyze the given premise, hypothesis, and options in more detail. Premise: Stop thinking stupid thoughts. This premise is an imperative statement instructing an individual to cease the act of contemplating thoughts that are considered unintelligent or nonsensical. Hypothesis: Think about all the stupid things. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposition suggesting that an individual should consider all things that are deemed as stupid or foolish. Options: +yes. +it is not possible to tell. +no. These options indicate whether or not the hypothesis logically follows the premise. Now, let's evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise instructs a person to stop thinking about \\"stupid thoughts,\\" while the hypothesis encourages the consideration of all \\"stupid things.\\" At first glance, these two statements appear contradictory. The premise advocates for avoiding \\"stupid thoughts,\\" while the hypothesis seems to promote reflecting on \\"stupid things.\\" However, upon closer examination, there may be a distinction between \\"stupid thoughts\\" and \\"stupid things.\\" \\"Stupid thoughts\\" can be interpreted as irrational or illogical ideas or beliefs held by an individual. On the other hand, \\"stupid things\\" might refer to a broader range of subjects, including actions, objects, or external circumstances that are deemed foolish or nonsensical. In this context, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis becomes more nuanced. While both involve the theme of \\"stupidity,\\" the premise targets cognitive processes (i.e., thoughts), whereas the hypothesis encompasses a wider scope of considerations, including external elements. Given this distinction, it is plausible to suggest that the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Stopping \\"stupid thoughts\\" does not directly translate to engaging in thoughts about \\"stupid things.\\" It is entirely possible for an individual to cease thinking about irrational thoughts while still contemplating or analyzing \\"stupid things\\" in the world around them. As such, there is not enough information presented to logically deduce that the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. In conclusion, given the available information and understanding of the context, it is not possible to tell with certainty that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is undefined based on the provided statements, and further clarification is required to establish a more definitive link between them. Therefore, the appropriate answer to the question is: +it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"How does RNA and DNA bind more?\\" Context: \\"Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.\\" Answer: A:","output":"RNA and DNA bind more through the interaction of transcription factors, regulatory sequences, and the formation of DNA loops. Transcription factors, such as activator proteins and repressor proteins, bind to specific regulatory sequences upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. By doing so, they modulate the ability of RNA polymerase to bind to DNA and initiate transcription. When an activator protein binds to an enhancer sequence, it helps recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter region, increasing the rate of transcription. In contrast, when a repressor protein binds to a silencer sequence, it makes the DNA less available for RNA polymerase binding, reducing transcription. The looping of DNA allows these regulatory sequences and transcription factors to come into close proximity to the RNA polymerase binding site, which in turn significantly affects gene expression and ultimately determines how strongly DNA and RNA interact in the transcription process."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the given process of mold growth. The process involves a mold spore floating through the air, landing on bread, growing hyphae into the bread, forming a colony, and sporangiophores growing upward.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: A. no. B. yes.","output":"A. no. While both questions involve communication through messaging platforms, they are different in terms of the platforms they are referring to and the core concern of the question. The first question pertains to Google and the storing and access of custom status messages on Google Talk (GTalk). On the other hand, the second question addresses the visibility of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage for non-friends. To elaborate further on both questions: 1. Google Talk, popularly known as GTalk, was an instant messaging service provided by Google. It was discontinued and replaced by Google Hangouts in 2013. Google Talk did allow users to set custom status messages, but it is ambiguous as to whether Google stored these messages and could be accessed even after being cleared locally. Since Google's privacy policy indicates that they may store certain data, it's possible that custom status messages could have been stored, but accessing those messages after clearing them locally might not be feasible. It would likely depend on your email service provider's data storage and retention policies. 2. Facebook and iMessage are two different messaging platforms developed by two different companies – Facebook and Apple, respectively. Sending a message to a person through Facebook and iMessage requires using their respective apps and services. If you send a message to someone using Facebook Messenger and you are not friends, the message will go to their Other/Message Request folder, and your recipient may or may not see it depending on their settings or if they check that folder. However, the recipient's ability to read that message has no connection with iMessage, as it operates on a completely separate platform. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. They address two distinct concerns and involve separate messaging platforms and issues (Google and the storage of custom statuses on GTalk vs. Facebook and the readability of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage to non-friends)."},{"instruction":"Which actor was the first director of the National Theatre ?","output":"To find the information, I will use the following steps: 1.

People's schedules can vary greatly due to work shifts, cultural practices, or personal preferences. Therefore, a reasonable approach to identify a day for relaxation would be to determine a day when the majority of the population has a day off work.

Kennedy Airport in New York, U.S., February 3, 2017. REUTERS/Bria Webb (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in Seattle on Friday granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on President Donald Trump’s executive order made last week that temporarily barred entry to the United States to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. The ruling is the broadest to date against Trump’s directive. ||||| Seattle judge halts nationwide enforcement of Trump's immigration order In an early test of President Donald Trump's so-called \\"Muslim ban,\\" a federal judge in Seattle on Friday halted the enforcement of the fastest-acting parts of the controversial week-old executive order. U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled on a motion by the state of Washington, issuing a temporary, nationwide restraining order stopping the parts of Trump's order that block entry to the U.S. by refugees and immigrants from some predominantly Muslim countries. Robart's ruling means refugees worldwide and certain immigrants from the seven countries Trump targeted will be allowed to enter the U.S. immediately. All have already been vetted by immigration officials. \\"Judge Robart's decision puts a halt to Trump's unconstitutional executive order nationwide,\\" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said after the ruling. White House spokesman Sean Spicer released a statement late Friday saying they \\"will file an emergency stay of this outrageous order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate.\\" Soon after, the White House sent out a new statement that removed the word \\"outrageous.\\" \\"The president's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\\" the statement said. Reuters, citing an airline official, reported that \\"U.S. Customs & Border Protection has informed U.S. airlines that they can once again board travelers who had been barred by an executive order last week.\\" Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. The judge's ruling could be appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. From the bench, Robart acknowledged the sweeping impact of his ruling. \\"There is a very narrow question before the court today,\\" Robart said. \\"Although that question is narrow, the court is aware of the considerable impact that will have on the parties here\\" and across the nation. Friday’s was the first hearing in Washington state’s lawsuit filed Monday against Trump; Ferguson argued the order was discriminatory and illegal. Seattle-area companies Amazon and Expedia filed declarations in support of Washington’s case, and the state of Minnesota moved to join the case Wednesday. Following the ruling, Ferguson said Robart's decision will provide immediate relief to those targeted by Trump's order. \\"I'm certain the president will not like this decision,\\" the Seattle Democrat said. \\"But it is his job, it is his obligation to honor it, and I'll make sure he does.\\" The ruling comes after a week of confusion, protest and defiance against Trump’s executive order. Washington’s lawsuit, filed by Ferguson's office, was the first suit brought by a state against the Trump administration over the order, but Massachusetts, Virginia, New York and the city of San Francisco have all filed or joined other suits against Trump over the order. Several individuals have filed suit as well. Earlier Friday in Boston, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton sided with the administration and refused to extend a restraining order similar to the one Ferguson won. At the same time, a federal judge in Virginia, in a win for Trump's opponents, allowed the state to join a lawsuit against the immigration restriction. Ferguson argued that Trump’s order violates some clauses of the U.S. Constitution: The equal protection and due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment and the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Ferguson also argued the order violates several federal laws around immigration and religious protection. Defending Trump's order in Seattle, Department of Justice attorney Michelle Bennett argued that Trump's motivations could not be reviewed by a court because they dealt with matters of national security. Washington Solicitor General Noah Purcell, who argued the motion for the state Friday, took particular issue with that argument. \\"Frankly, the federal government's position about standard of review here is frightening,\\" Purcell said. \\"They're saying that you can't review anything the president says\\" if he says it's a matter of national security. Purcell focused largely on the negative impacts the state argued Trump's order has and will continue to have on state universities, as well as broad and potential economic impacts to tourism. Robart, a longtime attorney in private practice appointed to the federal bench in 2003 by President Bush, filed the formal ruling Friday evening. The judge's written order, released late Friday, said it's not the court's job to \\"create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches\\" of government. The court's job \\"is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country's laws.\\" Robart ordered federal defendants \\"and their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and persons acting in concert or participation with them are hereby enjoined and restrained from\\" enforcing the executive order.

Robart of the Western District of Washington has just ruled in favor of the Washington State Attorney General's motion for a temporary restraining order on key sections of POTUS's Muslim ban. The temporary restraining order immediately halts federal officers from enforcing sections of the ban that target refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. It also stops federal officers from enforcing the part of the ban that grants exemptions to refugees on the basis of their religion. \\"The fundamental work of this court is the recognition that it is only one of three equal branches of our government,\\" Robart said from the bench. \\"The role assigned to the court is not to create policy, and it is not to judge the wisdom of the policy created by the other two branches.\\" Robart continued: \\"The work of the judiciary is ensuring that the action taken by those two branches comport with our laws, and most importantly, our Constitution.\\" In court, the main prongs of the state's argument were that the executive order enforces religious discrimination, that it violates the due process of refugees, and that it causes irreparable harm to the state (and its institutions and people). Additionally, the state argued that the executive order deserves strict scrutiny—the highest form of judicial review—and that the executive order fails under that standard. Judge Robart at first seemed hesitant to conclude that the president's decision was based on religious discrimination; he pointed out that only one section of the executive order explicitly made mention of religion. But an exchange with the Department of Justice attorney arguing on behalf of POTUS laid bare some of the holes in the president's defense arguments. When Robart asked the DOJ's Michelle Bennett how many foreign nationals of the seven countries targeted by the ban had been arrested on domestic terrorism charges since 9/11, Bennett told the court she didn't know. Robart informed her that the answer was none. \\"You're here arguing on behalf of someone who says we have to protect the US from these individuals coming from these countries, and there's no support for that,\\" Robart said. Bennett replied that it was the president's duty to make that call, and that \\"the court doesn't get to look behind those determinations.\\" Robart said that he did have to find if the executive order was rationally based. \\"And rationally based to me implies that to some extent I have to find it grounded in facts as opposed to fiction.\\" Later, Washington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell said that he found part of the DOJ's argument \\"frightening.\\" \\"Their argument was essentially that if the president says, 'I'm doing this in the national security interest,' then the court cannot review whether that's the real reason, or whether there's really any rational reason for the president's action,\\" Purcell said. \\"And our view is that's not the law, that's a scary view of the law, and luckily the judge rejected that idea.\\" Eventually, Judge Robart found that the state demonstrated it had standing to bring the case, that the case was likely to succeed on its merits, and that a temporary restraining order was in the public interest. The temporary restraining order, which is far more substantive and wide-ranging than the stay issued by a federal judge in New York on January 28, will remain in place until a preliminary injunction hearing, which will be in the next two weeks to a month. \\"We are a nation of laws,\\" Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson said at a press conference after the hearing. \\"Not even the president can violate our Constitution, and Judge Robart made the right decision declaring this unconstitutional, and we look forward to further proceedings.\\" Update: The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected the Trump administration's motion to block Judge Robart's order and immediately reinstate the travel ban. Check out tweets from the courtroom: |||||Summary:","output":"A judge in Seattle has granted a temporary restraining order that stops key parts of President Trump's ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries from being enforced across the entire United States.

However, friends of Jutting claim that he was emotionally devastated after his fiancée, whose identity remains undisclosed, cheated on him during her time in New York. This incident is believed to have had a major impact on Jutting's mental health, significantly affecting his behavior and leading to a downward spiral. Growing increasingly isolated and disturbed, Jutting began to engage in dangerous behaviors, including substance abuse, frequenting seedy nightclubs, and harboring a deep resentment towards women. His high-pressure job as a banker only added to the mounting stress; the toxic combination of heartbreak, addiction, and escalating work demands drove Jutting further into darkness. On the fateful night of the murders, Rurik Jutting's behavior reached a boiling point. Unable to contain his rage any longer, he allegedly lured two unsuspecting women to his luxury apartment – promising them a night of fun and excitement. However, upon their arrival, Jutting's intentions proved much more sinister as the night unfolded into a horrifying scene of violence and brutality. Neighbors reported hearing blood-curdling screams echoing through the halls of the high-end apartment complex. Before long, police arrived and discovered the gruesome remains. The grisly aftermath of the night's events left a clear picture of the degradation and despair that had consumed this once-promising young man. Shortly after his arrest, Rurik Jutting appeared in a Hong Kong court, where he was charged with two counts of murder. As he stood in the dock, hearing the litany of accusations against him, the weight of his actions began to sink in. Jutting showed little emotion and remained silent throughout the proceedings. As his fate was sealed, he understood that his life as a successful financier and respected member of society had come to a crashing halt. In the wake of the trial, questions began to emerge about how a seemingly intelligent and talented individual could descend into such darkness. As Jutting's former acquaintances, colleagues, and family came forward to offer insight into his life, a pattern of emotional instability, addiction, and deep-seated resentment for the women who had hurt him became apparent. Ultimately, Rurik Jutting's tragic story serves as a vivid reminder of the devastating consequences that can occur when mental health issues – exacerbated by addiction and personal betrayal – go untreated. The harrowing case of this once-promising young man highlights the importance of early intervention and support for those suffering from emotional turmoil, substance dependency, and unaddressed trauma. In the end, Jutting was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to life in prison. As he serves out his sentence, the world is left to reflect on the tragedy that unfolded and the lessons to be learned from the devastating series of events. His haunting tale will not soon be forgotten – a sobering reminder of the grim consequences that can occur when personal demons are left to fester and grow unchecked."},{"instruction":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.

Explanation: The news story is about Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who both got infected with the Ebola virus while treating patients in Liberia, and are now back in the States for their treatment. The story begins to talk about their efforts and compassion, then turns to discuss the lack of compassion and cruelty of others towards such patients. Therefore, it only makes sense to complete the story by mentioning 'Ebola', the disease that the two main individuals of the news story are suffering from. The other options do not fit the context of the story because: - AIDS: This disease is not discussed or mentioned in the story. - American, Americans, Brantly, Donald Trump, Emory University Hospital, Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Paul Wolpe, States, Wolpe: These options don't make sense as they are either names of people or places, which aren't the subject of cruelty and lack of compassion in this context. - Atlanta: Though it's the place of treatment for the protagonists, it doesn't factor into the history of American shame. - Liberia: While it's the place where the protagonists were infected, it doesn't pertain to documented American cruelty and lack of compassion. To clarify why 'Ebola' is the correct answer. Think about it like a story about two brave knights who got hurt fighting a big, scary dragon, and now not everyone is being kind to them because of their injuries from the dragon. The story would make sense if it ends by saying how people being unkind to others hurt by dragons is a sad thing. It wouldn't make as much sense if the story ended talking about people being unkind to those hurt by monsters, or unicorns, or anything else, since the knights were hurt by a dragon. Similarly, the news story makes sense ending with 'Ebola' because it's what Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were battling against."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

Just as The Wind Rises shows, Miyazaki is well-known for his obsession with flight, especially human flight. Other striking aspects of Miyazaki's films include his themes of environmental protection and the horrors of war. Miyazaki's work is also famous for its lack of clearly defined good and evil characters. He sees the 21st century as a complex time when old norms need to be re-examined.

OPT: (a). yes. (b). no.","output":"(b). no. Although your description is accurate for a monopole antenna, it doesn't necessarily imply that a monopole antenna is a portion of the half-wave dipole. These are two distinct types of antennas with their unique characteristics, capabilities, and applications. First, let's discuss the half-wave dipole antenna. As its name suggests, this type of antenna is typically half of the wavelength (λ) of the frequency that it is intended to receive or transmit. It consists of two identical rod-shaped conductors positioned end to end, with the feedline connected between the ends. Its radiation pattern is bidirectional and it resembles a donut shape. The half-wave dipole is often used in various radio and telecommunications applications due to its relatively simple design and balanced nature, which minimizes RF currents on the feedline. The monopole antenna, on the other hand, is a type of radio antenna formed by replacing one half of a dipole antenna with a ground plane at right-angles to the remaining half. It often appears as a single straight rod, and its length is typically about a quarter of the wavelength (λ/4) of the desired frequency. Compared to a half-wave dipole of the same height, a vertically oriented monopole antenna has a similar radiation pattern in the horizontal direction but a gain that is twice as high in the direction perpendicular to the antenna. This makes monopole antennas particularly beneficial in many applications, including mobile communications and broadcasting. In summary, while the monopole can be thought of as one half of a dipole antenna \\"reflected\\" into the ground, it's not accurate to state that \\"a monopole antenna is a portion of the half-wave dipole.\\" Both antennas are unique in their design, operation, and use. Should you wish to compare the two, it would be more appropriate to state that a monopole is analogous to one half of a dipole antenna when the other half of the dipole is replaced with a ground plane."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @ddlovato Hahahaha well good luck for your show tmmr No im not coming because i dont live there Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"Step 1: Read and understand the tweet The tweet is directed at the user @ddlovato and seems to be regarding a show they have tomorrow.

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \\"Code Red\\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer.

The like terms in this equation are the terms with the variable s. On the left side of the equation, we have -116s and 92s. Add the coefficients of these terms. -116s + 92s = (-116 + 92)s = -24s So the equation becomes: -24s + 7475 = -349s Step 2: Add 349s to both sides of the equation to eliminate the s terms on the right side. -24s + 7475 + 349s = -349s + 349s This simplifies to: 325s + 7475 = 0 Step 3: Subtract 7475 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable s. 325s + 7475 - 7475 = 0 - 7475 This simplifies to: 325s = -7475 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 325 to solve for s.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"believe the threat\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Under the circumstances presented, the question \\"What will others want to do next?\\" requires a thorough analysis of the context, the people involved, and possible motivations behind their actions. The answer \\"believe the threat\\" can be seen as a valid response, but it does not provide an in-depth perspective on the situation. Upon hearing that Tracy resigned from their position because of a threat to reveal a scandal, we must consider several factors and perspectives to understand what the people (\\"others\\") involved may want to do next. 1. The Person Threatening Tracy: The individual who threatened Tracy could potentially carry out their threat by revealing the scandal. Their motivations may include revenge, jealousy, or personal gain. On the other hand, this person may choose not to disclose the scandal, given that Tracy has complied with their demands. 2. Tracy's Colleagues: Tracy's coworkers may react to this news in various ways. Some may believe the threat, while others may question its validity or even offer support to Tracy. They may also want to conduct their own investigation into the perceived scandal, determine if and how it affects their work, or distance themselves from the situation. 3. Tracy's Friends and Family: People close to Tracy could be concerned about their well-being and may seek to offer emotional support or practical assistance. They may also wish to help Tracy fight the accusations if they believe they are unfounded or to encourage Tracy to come clean about the scandal if they believe there is truth to it. 4. Tracy's Superiors and the Organization: Depending on whether the organization believes the threat, they may undertake an internal investigation, consult with legal or human resources departments, or even reach out to Tracy for clarification. They may seek to preserve the organization's image by distancing themselves from Tracy or by attempting to minimize the impact of the scandal. 5. The Public: If the information about the threat becomes public knowledge, there may be various responses from the general public. Some may believe the threat, while others may not. They may become more curious about the scandal, request further information from both Tracy and the organization, and potentially take sides. In conclusion, \\"believe the threat\\" can be a valid answer to \\"What will others want to do next?\\" However, it only represents one facet of a complex situation encompassing the perspectives of several parties. It is essential to analyze all the stakeholders' potential actions and motivations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what others may want to do following Tracy's resignation."},{"instruction":"As of the census of 2010, there were 181,440 people, 67,499 households, and 43,536 families residing in the county.

Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth was seen without her wedding ring yesterday as it emerged she is to divorce PR guru Matthew Freud after 13 years. The TV boss showed a brave face as she stepped out to go jogging with her dog. The couple – worth £260million between them – are divorcing amid rumours of a long-standing conflict between Mr Freud and his father-in-law, worsened by a row over Tony Blair’s friendship with the media tycoon’s ex-wife. Mr Freud, 50, and Miss Murdoch, 46, who have two children aged 13 and seven, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. Sources said one factor in the breakdown of their marriage was the antagonism between the PR chief and Mr Murdoch. Mr Freud took the side of his old friend Mr Blair when his 83-year-old father-in-law filed for divorce from Wendi Deng, 45, last year after becoming angered by claims the former prime minister met his wife several times without his knowledge. Friends of Mr Blair have always insisted his relationship with Miss Deng is entirely platonic. Relations between Mr Freud and Mr Murdoch then soured further, culminating in him banning his father-in-law from attending his 50th birthday party at his £8million Oxfordshire mansion, Burford Priory, last November. Mr Freud said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. ‘Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted. Scroll down for video. Rift (left to right): Rupert Murdoch and his daughter Elisabeth, Wendi Deng and Matthew Freud. ‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’ A family friend told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Matthew and Elisabeth were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years.’ The couple are expected to split their £260million fortune equally. Miss Murdoch personally made £130million in 2011 when she sold her TV production company Shine, whose hit programmes include MasterChef, to her father’s company News Corporation. Freud and Murdoch were married 13 years. Her husband, who is the great-grandson of psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud, founded PR company Freud Communications and is worth an estimated £100million. They met in 1997, when they were both married to other people, and were immediately attracted to each other. Having left their spouses, Miss Murdoch and Mr Freud had their first child, Charlotte, in November 2000. They briefly separated before marrying at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2001. Their second child, Samson, was born in January 2007. The couple’s parties were legendary for their heady mix of celebrities, senior politicians, media stars and colourful entrepreneurs. Their combined wealth was estimated at £260million in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranked them as one of the top 25 wealthiest couples in the UK. The couple have made no public comment about their separation. But Mr Freud’s sister, radio presenter Emma Freud, retweeted a message from former Sun editor David Yelland: ‘Very sorry to read about the Matthew Freud-Elisabeth Murdoch split, but what I do know is they’re both great parents.’ A source close to Rupert Murdoch said yesterday that his daughter had her father’s full love and support but did not comment further.","output":"1.

The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that \\"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\\".\\" Answer:","output":"The seventh-generation console that floundered late in its lifespan is the Nintendo Wii. Although it sold the most console units during that generation and introduced innovative motion control gaming, the Wii eventually experienced a drop in third-party software support in its later years. This decline can be attributed to multiple factors, which ultimately led to a weaker impact in the gaming landscape compared to its competitors, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. One of the primary reasons for the Wii's decline was its limited hardware capabilities. As the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 pushed the boundaries of gaming technology with impressive graphics, processing power, and online services, the Wii was left lagging in these areas. These factors made it difficult for third-party developers to create visually stunning and resource-intensive games for the Wii, as they could not take full advantage of the technology available to them. Consequently, this led to a smaller library of high-quality titles exclusive to the Wii. The Wii's control system, although innovative and fun for casual gamers, also contributed to its downturn. Many core gamers found the motion controls lacked precision and ultimately preferred the more traditional controls offered by the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. This resulted in a smaller market for third-party developers to cater to, as core gamers gravitated towards the rival consoles. Another factor contributing to the Wii's struggles was its inability to maintain a strong library of high-quality titles to keep up with the demands of both casual and hardcore gamers. As the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 amassed an expansive repertoire of critically acclaimed games, the Wii suffered from a scarce and inconsistent flow of well-regarded titles. This discouraged a substantial portion of the gaming audience from investing in the Wii, and consequently, affected long-term sales and support for the console. Lastly, the Wii's branding and marketing strategy contributed to its decline, as it was often perceived as a casual gaming console. This alienated a broad portion of the gaming market, as many players were seeking a more diverse and feature-rich gaming experience. The Wii's successor, the Wii U, also had a poor debut in 2012, further contributing to the view that Nintendo lost its momentum late in the seventh-generation console cycle. In summary, the seventh-generation console that floundered late in its lifespan is the Nintendo Wii, primarily due to its limited hardware capabilities, lack of precise motion controls, inconsistent library of high-quality titles, and branding as a casual gaming console. These factors combined to weaken the console's overall position in the market, resulting in the eventual decline of third-party software support and the console's standing compared to its rivals, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3."},{"instruction":"A standard home blow dryer will kill 96.7% of eggs with proper technique.

Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor. Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was elected MP for Great Grimsby in 1977 but will step down at the next election. A veteran Labour MP has claimed the 'problem' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues which are relevant to ordinary people. Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby, said the increasing number of women in the Commons would be 'less inclined to discuss the big issues'. His remarks, on the BBC's Woman's Hour this morning, sparked fury and calls for the Labour leader Ed Miliband to make it clear he disagrees. It comes after Mr Mitchell this weekend claimed that the growing number of female MPs in the Labour party was making it too ‘gentle’ to wield power after the next election. Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘amenable and leadable’ women obsessed with feminism. The Labour MP, who is stepping down at the next election, said Labour was becoming more ‘family-friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. Speaking today, Mr Mitchell attempted to explain his remarks. He said: 'I think the problem is simply this, that parliament with more women is going to be more anxious to discuss issues relevant to the people, that is to say family issues, social issues. 'And less inclined to discuss big issues like should we invade Iraq.' But Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry dismissed the remarks. She said: 'Austin Mitchell’s at it again, talking nonsense and insulting women with his absurd theories. To say that women don’t care about the big issues is just not true. 'Ed Miliband should make it absolutely clear he doesn’t agree with Mitchell’s ridiculous remarks.' Mr Mitchell said the parliamentary Labour party was undergoing ‘the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day’. But he added: ‘Whatever the state of Labour’s policies for the next Election, there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger, more attractive body of candidates. Almost half of Labour's cabinet are women and Ed Miliband is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today. Labour's leading women, pictured here, from left back row: Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Rosie Winterton, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Curran, Baronness Royall. Front row: Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendal, Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Tessa Jowell. Labour introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female MPs - 81 out of 257. But Mr Mitchell said all-women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as Yorkshire and the North as a form of punishment ‘for their earlier male chauvinism’. He said: ‘If Labour wins in 2015, how a family-friendly, gentler party, less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind, will face up to Tory hooligans who feel they’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that’s their due, is a more worrying matter.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell claimed that the 'problem' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues relevant to ordinary people. 2. Mitchell said that increasing the number of women in the Commons would make them 'less inclined to discuss the big issues.' 3. Mitchell's remarks sparked calls for Labour leader Ed Miliband to make it clear he disagrees with these views. 4. Mitchell also stated that the growing number of female MPs in the Labour party was making it too 'gentle' to wield power after the next election. 5. Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry dismissed Mitchell's remarks as nonsense and insulting to women."},{"instruction":"Where would you stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold? Options: - graph - bank at noon - good book - post office - bus stop Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"To determine the most appropriate option for standing in a line and needing a coat if it is cold, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Graph: A graph is a visual representation of data or information. It is not a physical place where you would stand in a line. 2. Bank at noon: The bank is a place where you may need to stand in a line, particularly at noon when many people take their lunch break to run errands. If it is cold outside and the line extends outside the bank, you would need a coat to keep warm. 3. Good book: A good book is not a physical location where you would stand in a line. It is an enjoyable piece of reading material. 4. Post office: The post office is another place where you may need to stand in a line, especially during busy hours or peak mailing times (e.g., holidays). If it is cold outside and you need to wait in an outdoor line, you would need a coat to stay warm. 5. Bus stop: A bus stop is a location where people wait in line for public transportation. If it is cold outside, you would need a coat to stay warm while you wait for the bus. Using this step-by-step reasoning, both \\"bank at noon,\\" \\"post office,\\" and \\"bus stop\\" are physically appropriate places where you might stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold. However, the post office and bus stop are more likely to involve waiting outdoors, making it colder and increasing the likelihood of needing a coat.

Answer: (E) Justification: Human senses are traditionally categorized into five main types: (A) sight, (B) hearing, (C) smell, (D) touch, and (E) taste. These senses allow us to gather information from our environment and react accordingly. Taste is a crucial sense that helps us identify and enjoy flavors in the food we consume, as well as avoid potentially harmful substances. The sense of taste (E) is a complex process that involves specialized sensory cells on our tongue, called taste buds, which detect chemical substances in food. Taste buds send information to our brain to interpret the specific flavors we experience, such as sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami. This sense not only plays a crucial role in our enjoyment and appreciation of diverse culinary experiences, but it also serves important biological functions like aiding in digestion and signaling potential dangers, such as spoiled or toxic food."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given an input i,A where i is an integer and A is an array.

The equation can be set up as follows: Original cost = Reduced cost x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) Here, 0.9 * x is the reduced price per kg (90% of the original price), and y + 20 is the increased quantity of salt purchased due to the 10 % reduction in price. Now, let's simplify the equation: x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) x * y = 0.9 * x * y + 0.9 * x * 20 x * y - 0.9 * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 (1 - 0.9) * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 0.1 * x * y = 18 * x As long as x is not zero, we can divide both sides by 0.1 * x: y = 18 * 10 y = 180 Now, to find the original price per kg (x), we use the original cost equation: x * y = 400 x * 180 = 400 x = 400 / 180 x = 20 / 9 x = 2.222 (rounded to 3 decimal places) From the given options, the closest value for x is 2.2, which corresponds to option c.

Cuisine: The Phoenix focuses on serving French cuisine, which often emphasizes the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients, and a balance of flavors. In French gastronomy, emphasis is placed on the presentation and aroma of dishes, as well as the overall dining experience. Customers at The Phoenix can expect to find a variety of traditional French dishes, such as coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon, escargot, and tarte Tatin, among others. The Phoenix food French suggests that the restaurant endeavors to bring the authentic flavors of France to its diners. Customer Rating: Despite the restaurant's focus on offering French cuisine and its strategic riverside location, its customer rating is low. This indicates that The Phoenix may not be meeting the expectations of its clientele in certain areas. The low rating could be attributed to various factors, such as the quality of food, service, ambiance, or value for money. The management at The Phoenix might need to take proactive measures to address these concerns and improve the overall dining experience to better cater to the needs of their customers. An in-depth analysis of customer reviews can help them identify specific issues that need improvement. Location: The Phoenix is situated in a beautiful riverside area, providing a picturesque backdrop for dining experiences.

Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","output":"Apples retained their quality longer, since they were candied and the process of candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year."},{"instruction":"Given the question \\"What does the man suggest the woman do?\\" and the answer \\"Tell Tony's mother that she eats no meat.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.","output":"Man: Hey, I heard you're invited to Tony's family dinner tonight.

Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Religion significantly affected the ruler of the country, particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic, as it became more closely intertwined with political offices. This connection can be seen through the role of the pontifex maximus, which became largely associated with the highest political figures, like consuls. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was vested with a vast range of political, military, and priestly powers. He acquired numerous major priesthoods in Rome, including that of pontifex maximus, which allowed him to showcase these roles as traditional honors. His religious power and influence were utilized to implement several reforms, which he presented as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory rather than innovative. Some notable examples of these reforms include the elevation of the ancient Arvales, the promotion of plebeian Compitalia, and the patronage of the Vestal Virgins as a means of restoring Roman morality. Augustus's religious authority enabled him to establish and maintain the pax deorum, or the peace of the gods, throughout his reign. He also took the responsibility of adopting a successor to ensure the continuation of this religious and social stability. In conclusion, religion played a substantial role in influencing and shaping the rule of the Roman Empire, particularly in the context of the ruler's duties and responsibilities. This influence can be seen through the religious reforms and practices implemented by Augustus, which not only solidified his power but also demonstrated the importance of religion in maintaining social order and stability."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -4264 + 4324 = -10*s for s.

To do that, you can imagine you owe someone 4264 candies, but then your friend gives you 4324 candies. How many candies are you left with? 4324 - 4264 = 60 So now you have 60 candies. Now let's move on to the second part of the problem. The problem says -10 times \\"s\\" is equal to the number of candies you have. So, -10 * s = 60. Now we want to find the value of 's'. To do that, you can think of it like dividing 60 candies among 10 people, but since it's -10, it means dividing it among 10 imaginary people. So, 60 divided by -10 is: 60 / -10 = -6 So 's' is -6.

Similarly, don't bombard them with information about yourself or brag about your current life. Instead, keep the conversation balanced, with each of you sharing information about yourselves. Don't feel pressured to share sensitive information. Balance questions with details about yourself. If you didn't part with your old friend on the best of terms, you'll probably want to address this fairly soon — ideally, the very first time you reconnect. Pretending that your painful memories don't exist is a bad choice. Doing this can give the impression that you don't care about your friend's hurt feelings, or, worse, that you're deliberately ignoring them, so swallow your pride and openly acknowledge any tension early on. If, after your time apart, you've decided that you were partially or completely to blame for your painful split, offer your sincere apology. If you don't believe you were at fault, simply acknowledge your desire to move on with a few words like this: \\"Hey, I know the last time we saw each other we weren't on the best of terms. I was hoping we could put all that behind us and start fresh.\\" Be wary of immediately returning to your previous level of intimacy with your old friend. Keep in mind that your friend may not have the same plans in mind for your reunion as you do — he, for instance, may only be interested in a brief, one-time meal together while you're seriously trying to restart your friendship. It's best not to get too invested in your reunion before it happens. Instead, approach it with an optimistic but calm attitude. This way, no matter how your reunion goes, you won't end up feeling hurt and disappointed. To avoid an embarrassing faux pas, be careful not to bring up controversial topics until you have an idea of where your friend stands on them. Keep in mind that even if these topics were at one point the topic of frequent conversation between you two, they may not be today. People — even people close to you — can have their opinions shaped and molded by their experiences until they barely resemble what they once were. Below are just a few topics you'll want to avoid until you get a chance to \\"feel out\\" your friend: Religion Politics Hot-button news topics Money Negative gossip about mutual friends The opposite sex Finding it difficult to come up with things to say to your old friend? Just try asking him about what he's been up to since you've last seen him. When he answers, ask questions about his answers. As a general rule, most people like to talk about themselves — psychological studies have shown that people spend the majority of the time they spend communicating talking about themselves, rather than others. Below are just a few sample questions you may want to try asking: Where have you been working or attending school recently? How are things with the guys/ladies? How is the family? Can you help me with this problem I've been thinking about? Read any good books lately? A responsible amount of alcohol can usually take the edge out of awkward social situations. Thus, if you and your old friend are of age, consider having an alcoholic beverage or two to calm the jitters that can come with making a connection with an old buddy. With luck, after a drink or two, you'll feel loose, friendly, and ready to have a great time! Whenever alcohol is involved, it's important to drink responsibly. See our responsible drinking guide for more information and remember to never, ever drink and drive.","output":"When reconnecting with an old friend, it's important to maintain a balanced conversation, sharing information about yourselves without oversharing or asking too many questions.

We learn that Sam pays his sister's rent and buys her groceries, and that she rarely leaves the apartment and lives in squalor in a run-down section of Detroit.That night, Elizabeth (Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's murdered girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino), arrives at Sam's apartment. She believes that the man about to be executed for her sister's murder, Lonnie Flennonds (Richard Wilkinson), is innocent, and she offers to pay Sam to find the real murderer. Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. We learn that a fire that claimed the lives of Sam and Jenna's parents had claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that their parents died instead. After Goldburg's departure, their buxom bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones) seductively offers Sam a buttery nipple; he and Vicki have sex, but upon seeing Rebecca's photo, he cannot continue.Sam changes his mind and agrees to help Elizabeth out. He tries to help Lonnie without time-traveling, but Lonnie refuses the help, believing Sam to be the culprit. Frustrated, Sam travels back to June 1998. He first runs into a drunk Elizabeth, telling her to stay in her locked car. He goes into Rebecca's bedroom to find her already dead; while there, Elizabeth is attacked from her backseat.

There are 3 red gumballs (R) and 2 blue gumballs (B) in the jar, for a total of 5 gumballs. Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing two blue gumballs consecutively. 1st draw: Probability of drawing a blue gumball is 2/5 (there are 2 blue ones and 5 gumballs in total). After this, there is now 1 blue gumball left and a total of 4 gumballs in the jar. 2nd draw: Probability of drawing the other blue gumball is 1/4 (there is 1 blue one left and 4 gumballs in total).

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

It is the main river in eastern Afghanistan and is separated from the watershed of the Helmand by the Unai Pass. The Kabul River passes through the cities of Kabul and Jalalabad in Afghanistan before flowing into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan some north of the Durand Line border crossing at Torkham. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar, Alingar, Bara and Swat rivers. - Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. - The Kunar River (Urdu,), also called the Chitral River or the Kama River, is about 480 km long, located in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan. The river system is fed by melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is also part of the Indus watershed basin. - Durrani or Abdali is the name of a prominent Sarbani Pashtun tribal confederation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Originally known by their ancient name \\"Abdali\\", which may derive from the more ancient \\"Ebodalo\\" (Bactrian: \\"\\" / \\"Hephthalites\\"). They have been called \\"Durrani\\" since the beginning of the Durrani Empire in 1747. The number of Durrani is estimated to be roughly 16% of the population of Afghanistan or 5 million individuals. Durrani are found throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan; although large concentrations are found in southern Afghanistan, they are also found to a lesser extent in east, west and central Afghanistan. Many Durranis are found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. The Durrani Pashtuns of the Afghan capital Kabul are usually bilingual in Pashto and Dari Persian. The ruling Sadozai and Barakzai dynasties of Afghanistan were originally from the Durrani. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia.

It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - Atrial fibrillation (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Most episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia. High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with one of these risks. A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion can also be used to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, it affects about 2% to 3% of the population. This is an increase from 0.4 to 1% of the population around 2005. In the developing world about 0.6% of... - Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes. - Faisal Ahmad Shinwari ( or Fazal Hadi Shinwari ) ( 1927 -- February 21 , 2011 ) was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan from 2001 until 2006 .

Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from... - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled. - Hamid Karzai (Pashto/Persian: ; born 24 December 1957) served as President of Afghanistan for almost ten years, from 7 December 2004 to 29 September 2014.

Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are almost 100% Pashto-speaking, while it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 4560 million people worldwide. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\".

When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer.

Data on the 203,500 street stops from January through March — up from 183,326 during the same quarter a year earlier — was sent to the City Council from 1 Police Plaza late on Friday under a legal requirement spawned by public outrage over the 1999 fatal police shooting in the Bronx of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black street peddler. On Saturday, the department disclosed the information to reporters and credited the controversial topic known as “Stop, Question, Frisk” as one of several policies of engagement whose effectiveness was vindicated by a decline in homicides in New York. So far this year, 129 people have been murdered in New York through Friday, the 132nd day of the year, a number that put the city on track for a new low in annual homicides. The 471 murders logged by the Police Department in 2009 was the lowest annual tally for any previous 12-month period since reliable numbers were kept in the early 1960s. Still, the new street-stop numbers got a fresh round of criticism after a week that saw civil libertarians and prospective mayoral candidates debating the crime-suppression value of such stops and blaming the tactics for tearing at the fabric of city life, particularly in minority neighborhoods, during a period of historically low violence. On Wednesday, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a study of last year’s stop data, arguing that far too many innocent people were suffering under the policy. The study said that while young black and Hispanic men made up 4.7 percent of the city’s population, those between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 41.6 percent of stops in 2011. On Saturday, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said the “dramatic increase” in stops underscored her calls for reform. “While the N.Y.P.D. should continue to have the ability to stop and frisk people where there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, I remain convinced that with better monitoring, supervision and accountability we can avoid the corrosive impact of a poorly targeted program,” Ms. Quinn said in a statement. “We cannot continue to stop, question and frisk nearly 700,000 New Yorkers in this way without doing harm to the relationship between police officers and the people they are protecting, particularly in communities of color.” And the city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, said that while the rise in stops seemed a product of a numbers-driven police culture, he proposed more routine use of the department’s own auditing of those statistics to track the outcomes for each stop-and-frisk episode, like whether someone is then arrested. “The record number of unwarranted stops is widening the rift between police and the communities whose cooperation we need to fight crime,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. “Make no mistake — this is the result of City Hall aggressively pushing precinct commanders to use stop and frisk beyond what is necessary and effective. It’s time to bring these numbers back to earth.” Both Ms. Quinn and Mr. de Blasio are expected to run for mayor. Peppered with questions at a news conference on Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that critics of the street-stop tactics “never have an answer” about how to tackle the disproportionate levels of crime in certain city neighborhoods. The department, by contrast, is always looking for answers to “slow down” crime. “I would submit that our strategies are saving lives,” Mr. Kelly said. He added: “You look at the numbers in this city; you look at the lives that we’re saving, and I would submit to you that the majority of those lives are minorities, and most of them are young men who are being killed for senseless reasons. We are saving those lives, and, quite frankly, we’re saving them at a much greater degree and extent than other cities are.” Last year, there were 685,724 stop-and-frisk encounters, the highest total in the 10 years the department has reported the data. The annual total has gradually increased, from a low of 97,296 in 2002, according to departmental statistics.

This holiday commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas on October 12, 1492. Columbus Day was first celebrated in various states and cities across the United States in the 1800s. It eventually became a federal holiday in 1937 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, the specific date of the holiday – the second Monday in October – was established through the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 and took effect in 1971. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act aimed to provide more three-day weekends for the nation's workers by shifting the celebration of some national holidays to Mondays. This act also moved the observation of holidays like Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day to fixed Mondays, thus creating more consistent long weekends and reducing employee absenteeism. While Columbus Day is still a federal holiday in the United States, the celebration and recognition of this day have become a topic of debate in recent years. Many have criticized the holiday, pointing out the suffering that indigenous populations faced as a result of Columbus's arrival and the subsequent colonization. As a result, various cities and states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day or Native American Day to honor the original inhabitants of the Americas and their rich history and culture. Nonetheless, Columbus Day is still observed as a federal holiday by financial institutions, the United States Postal Service, and federal offices, among others. Some states and communities hold parades, festivals, and educational events to commemorate both the historical significance of the day and its evolving meaning in contemporary society."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

Astute marketing The hypothesis states that because the book was written and marketed well, it sold well. Step 3: Compare the factors in the premise and the hypothesis. \\"The book was written well\\" in the hypothesis can be considered synonymous with \\"the book has a soothingly simplistic thesis\\" in the premise because both imply the book's content was appealing to readers. Similarly, \\"the book was marketed well\\" in the hypothesis aligns with \\"astute marketing\\" in the premise, as both denote effective marketing strategies contributing to commercial success. Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Since the factors in the hypothesis align with the factors identified in the premise, we could conclude that the premise supports the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"Because the book was marketed and written well, it sold well.\\""},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

A step-by-step solution is:","output":"Yes, it is true that \\"A girl wearing a t-shirt on the beach\\" given the sentence \\"A little girl wearing an Elmo t-shirt is on the beach.\\" Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. First, recognize the main subject and action in the original sentence: \\"A little girl\\" is the subject, and being \\"on the beach\\" is the action. 2. Next, identify the key attributes of the subject, which is related to her outfit: \\"wearing an Elmo t-shirt.\\" 3. Now, let's analyze the second sentence: \\"A girl wearing a t-shirt on the beach.\\" Again, the main subject is \\"A girl\\" and the action is being \\"on the beach.\\" 4. In the second sentence, the key attribute of the girl is: \\"wearing a t-shirt.\\" 5. Compare the two sentences: Both subjects (a little girl and a girl) describe the same person.

If you are a woman and marry an Emirati citizen, you will not automatically become an Emirati citizen. As a woman, you can get Emirati citizenship as a dependent of your husband, if your husband is an Emirati citizen. Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts. Once you marry an Emirati citizen, you will generally have the right to reside in the UAE with your spouse. However, you will not have the benefits of being a citizen. When you get married, go to the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA). Bring your marriage certificate and identification. Tell them that you want to become a national, and they will give you forms to complete. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, any children your wife gives birth to will not be Emirati citizens. They will have to wait until they are 18 to apply for citizenship, and in the meantime you will have to pay for education and healthcare for the child that Emirati citizens get for free. If you marry an Emirati citizen, you will not become eligible for Emirati citizenship until you have been married for 3 years from the date you expressed your intent to become a national. Keep in mind this rule only applies to women who marry men who are Emirati citizens. A man who marries an Emirati woman will not be eligible for citizenship by virtue of the marriage. The UAE does not recognize dual citizenship. If you want to become an Emirati citizen through marriage, you must be willing to revoke any citizenship you currently have. Contact the embassy or consulate of your country of origin to find out what you need to do to officially revoke your citizenship. To apply for citizenship, your husband must complete a form and supply documents to the GDRFA that prove your identity and indicate your desire to become a citizen of the UAE. You will have to pay a fee for the request to be processed. You must be present with your husband when he submits the form and documents. Summary:","output":"In the UAE, women and men don't have the same citizenship rights. If a woman marries a man from the UAE, she won't automatically become a citizen, but she can become a citizen if her husband is one. Women are considered dependents of their husbands or fathers.

Mrs Ben-Nejma returned to A&E the following day with severe pain but was still diagnosed with gastroenteritis and sent her home with painkillers. The next day she suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. She died on December 20, her daughter Charlotte's 13th birthday.","output":"Title: An Unfortunate Sequence of Events: A Tale of Missed Diagnosis and Tragedy Rebecca Ben-Nejma's experience is a shocking reminder of how misdiagnoses and gaps in the healthcare system can have tragic consequences. Visiting the Maidstone Hospital's Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) with a complaint of severe stomach pain, Rebecca hoped to receive an effective, timely, and accurate diagnosis. Instead, she was met with a misplaced diagnosis, missed opportunities, and an unavailable department that contributed to her untimely death. When Rebecca first arrived at A&E, the healthcare professionals on duty suspected that the abdominal discomfort she experienced was gastritis, a common inflammatory condition of the stomach. Believing this to be the diagnosis, the hospital staff prescribed painkillers and discharged her to manage her symptoms at home. Despite the initial diagnosis, one observant doctor suggested a differential —the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening condition wherein the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes. The doctor's recommendation to rule out such a possibility indicated a discerning approach that could have changed Rebecca's fate. However, the much-needed scanning department had its doors closed for the weekend, which left Rebecca's case based solely on clinical suspicion, rather than conclusive evidence. Rebecca returned to A&E the following day, her symptoms having escalated into severe pain. Yet, the diagnosis remained unchanged, with the medical team standing firm in their belief that she was suffering from gastroenteritis. Again, they sent her home with nothing more than painkillers to manage her worsening pain. The subsequent sequence of events proved to be both heartbreaking and alarming. The next day, Rebecca suffered a heart attack, a potentially fatal complication often associated with extreme physical stress or underlying health conditions. She was rushed to the hospital in an attempt to save her life, but it was too late. Rebecca Ben-Nejma passed away on December 20th. Adding to the magnitude of the tragedy was the timing. December 20th was not just any ordinary day – it was the 13th birthday of her daughter, Charlotte. This poignant and distressing tale serves as a stark warning about the dire consequences of a misdiagnosis. The gaps in the operating times of crucial hospital departments, like the scanning division at Maidstone Hospital, can prevent the accurate diagnosis and treatment of critical medical conditions. Above all, it underscores the paramount importance of establishing a well-functioning healthcare system, capable of responding promptly and accurately to patient needs, no matter the time or the day."},{"instruction":"Data: Alvis Speed 25, transmission, \\"single plate clutch, separate 4-speed gearbox all-silent and all-syncromesh, centre change lever, open tubular propellor shaft with metal joints , spiral bevel fully floating back axle\\"; Alvis Speed 25, wheelbase, 127.0 (inches); Alvis Speed 25, class, \\"Full-size luxury car\\"; Alvis Speed 25, engine, 31.48 tax horsepower Sentence about the following data:","output":"The Alvis Speed 25, an esteemed full-size luxury car, stands out for its remarkable engineering and impressive design.

The reasoning for this is provided step-by-step below: 1. Taste is subjective: Taste depends on individual perceptions, and different people may experience flavors differently. Thus, saying something tastes like a particular substance can't be a fact for everyone universally. 2. People's taste differences are rooted in genetics: Research has shown that some individuals perceive coriander's taste as soapy due to genetic variations, particularly in a gene responsible for detecting certain smell molecules. 3. Opinions can't be confirmed or refuted as facts: The statement that coriander leaves taste like dish soap is an opinion, as it's based on personal perception. While there is a scientific basis for explaining why people might have this taste sensation, it cannot be established as a fact that applies to everyone. Conclusion: It's better to rephrase the statement to \\"Some people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as similar to dish soap,\\" and acknowledge that it is backed by scientific research. However, the taste remains a subjective experience and can't be verified as a fact for all individuals."},{"instruction":"Agissant en état de légitime défense, nos forces antiaériennes les ont contraints à rebrousser chemin à 12 h 50; Which language is this?","output":"This text is in French.

Doing this exercise 2 times weekly will build up strength in your biceps and eventually help you get better at pull-ups. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the dumbbells at your sides. Curl the dumbbells up to chest height, bending your elbows. Lower the dumbbells back to your sides. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 curls. This exercise simulates a pullup, but it's a lot easier to do because most of your weight is on the ground. It's an excellent way to start building up enough strength to do a pullup. You'll need either a dip bar or a sturdy mop or broom positioned across two chairs. Here's how to do it: Lie down with your neck positioned under the bar or broom. Bend your legs and keep your feet against the floor. Grip the bar with your palms facing out. Lift your chest toward the bar as far as possible. Lower back down to the ground and repeat. You'll need a pulldown machine to do this. It's another effective way to strengthen your upper body and make you better at pull-ups. Stand in front of a pulldown machine and grip the bar. Sit down and pull the bar down to your collar bones. Keep your shoulder blades down and back and lean backward while you do this. Repeat.

Yes or no? Answer: Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals, reptiles, birds, and other vertebrates . Question: where is testosterone produced Answer:","output":"Yes, testosterone is indeed a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals, reptiles, birds, and other vertebrates. To answer the question of where testosterone is produced, we need to understand its production in different sexes and species. In the human body, testosterone is primarily produced in the testes for males and the ovaries for females. However, small amounts are also synthesized in the adrenal glands for both sexes. In males, the testes are the main producers of testosterone. The Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes, are responsible for the majority of testosterone production. The hormone is synthesized from cholesterol through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland plays a significant role in regulating testosterone production. When LH binds to receptors on Leydig cells, it stimulates the synthesis and secretion of testosterone. In females, the ovaries are the primary source of testosterone production, though the amount produced is considerably less compared to males. The theca cells, present in the ovarian follicles, synthesize testosterone. Similar to males, the release of LH in females also influences testosterone production. However, most of the testosterone produced in the ovaries is converted into estradiol, the primary female sex hormone, through the action of an enzyme called aromatase. As mentioned earlier, the adrenal glands in females also contribute to testosterone production, though in much smaller quantities. In other vertebrates, testosterone production varies depending on the species, but the general pattern remains relatively similar. In most mammals and reptiles, the gonads (testes or ovaries) and the adrenal glands are responsible for testosterone synthesis, with the production being regulated by the release of LH from the pituitary gland. In conclusion, testosterone is produced primarily in the testes for males and the ovaries for females, with small amounts being synthesized in the adrenal glands for both sexes. The synthesis of testosterone is regulated by the release of luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. In other vertebrates, gonadal and adrenal testosterone production is also observed, regulated by similar hormonal mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Choices: - negative; - positive;).","output":"Title: Tripping Through Time Movie Review: Tripping Through Time is a testament to the pitfalls of an ill-conceived concept combined with shoddy execution. This sci-fi time travel film attempts to blend comedy and intrigue, but sadly, it spirals into a confusing and uninspired mess. The plot revolves around a group of college students who discover a time-traveling machine in their professor's basement. Excited to explore history first-hand, they embark on a journey to various notable events, aiming to fix the past. However, this noble intention becomes rapidly adulterated by the film's poor pacing, glaring plot holes, and mundane writing. The characters' motives and actions become blurred as they start to feel more like mere props moving to serve an unclear purpose rather than having any depth of personality. The lead characters, played by Amber Jones and Jake Williams, possess little to no chemistry on screen. Their interactions often feel rigid and forced, which further accentuates the failing script. Unfortunately, even strong attempts made by the supporting cast fail to foster any sense of camaraderie or connection among the characters. This is especially disastrous for a film that relies heavily on the dynamics between the different individuals. Director Thomas Bradley's choices leave much to be desired. Instead of focusing on the complexities of time travel and creating interesting themes, Bradley indulges in excessive special effects. While visually pleasing, this serves as a glaring reminder of how shallow the plot truly is. Furthermore, the mix of scientific jargon and poor dialogue creates a disconnect within the film's tone, making it difficult for the audience to immerse themselves in the experience. The cinematography is equally disappointing. Many shots feel stale and repetitive, failing to add any dynamism or flair to the narrative. The editor seems to have decided that jumping between timelines would be enough to hold the audience's attention, but ultimately it only adds to the confusion. The film's saving grace could have been its sense of humor but the attempts at comedy feel cliché and forced, only succeeding in making the audience cringe. This tragic combination results in a film that neither delivers on the drama nor the comedy front, leaving the viewer with an overwhelming sense of emptines at the end of the movie. In conclusion, Tripping Through Time is a lackluster film that crumbles under the weight of its own disjointed ambitions. Despite its dazzling special effects and intriguing premise, the absence of a compelling story, engaging characters, or even the slightest semblance of genuine emotion renders this film an unfortunate miss. For a truly enjoyable and memorable time-travel movie experience, it is advisable to look elsewhere."},{"instruction":"In Goes to Jail, Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail.

Would \\"In medicine , ischemia, also spelled as ischaemia or ischæmia, (; from Greek language ισχαιμία, ischaimía; isch- root denoting a restriction or thinning or to make or grow thin/lean, haema blood ) is a restriction in blood supply to tissues , causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive).\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Yes, the provided information is a reasonable answer in defining ischemia or infarction, and I can elaborate more on this topic to provide a detailed and long answer. Ischemia is a medical term that refers to the reduction of blood flow to tissues in the body. This decreased blood supply can cause a deficiency of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism and the overall health of the affected tissue. The term \\"ischemia\\" is derived from the Greek language, with \\"isch\\" signifying a restriction or thinning, and \\"haema\\" referring to blood. When ischemia occurs, it can lead to various health complications and, in severe cases, tissue damage or death, which is referred to as infarction. An infarction is the complete obstruction of blood flow to a particular tissue or organ that results in cellular death due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients. A common example of infarction is a myocardial infarction (heart attack), which can occur when the blood supply to the heart muscle is blocked. There are several causes of ischemia, including: 1. Atherosclerosis: The buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the arteries, causing a narrowing and reduced blood flow. 2. Thrombosis: A blood clot inside a blood vessel, blocking blood flow. 3. Embolism: A blood clot or other solid material that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow. 4. Vasospasm: The sudden constriction of blood vessels, which can result in reduced blood flow. 5. External Compression: Direct pressure on blood vessels due to trauma, injury, or other factors, causing a reduction in blood flow. The symptoms of ischemia can vary depending on the severity and the affected area in the body. For instance, cardiac ischemia may present with chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue, while cerebral (brain) ischemia could manifest as confusion, difficulty speaking, or paralysis on one side of the body. The diagnosis and treatment of ischemia often depend on the underlying cause and the affected area. Diagnostic tests may include imaging studies such as angiography, doppler ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or blood tests to evaluate oxygen and glucose levels in the tissue. Treatment options may involve medications (such as blood thinners, antiplatelet agents, or vasodilators), specific lifestyle changes, minimally invasive procedures (e.g., balloon angioplasty or stent placement), or surgery (e.g., bypass surgery or thrombectomy) to reestablish blood flow and prevent further complications. In conclusion, ischemia, or ischaemia, refers to the reduction of blood supply to tissues, which may lead to a shortage of oxygen and glucose necessary for cellular metabolism. This condition can result in tissue damage or infarction if left untreated, leading to significant health consequences. Proper diagnosis and treatment are crucial in addressing the underlying cause of ischemia and preventing further complications."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Trin-i-tee 5:7.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

This week is my 36th birthday; so to celebrate, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to make a trip to Vegas to go to one of my favorite clubs last weekend. I mean, why not? This past year, I received a kidney transplant. No more dialysis, so now I could travel freely. I had the money. No reason not to, right? I originally wanted to just go and book whatever hotel room I could find while I was in Vegas itself, but at the urging of a close friend, I chose to go online and see if I could find a deal. I used a third party website, and found a room at the Statosphere for 67 per night. Since I was traveling late, and would not get there until after midnight, I booked it for Saturday, figuring I would stay overnight and come back to LA on Sunday. No problem, right? Apparently, in Las Vegas, days do not begin at midnight like they do everywhere else in the U.S. They begin at 3pm, which was naturally not indicated on my confirmation. So when I got to the Statosphere, and tried to check in at midnight itself, I was told that I would have to buy two days, because this was still considered Friday. No attempt to make good, just to charge me more money, a pattern I would later learn was typical for the Stratosphere. Across the street was a sleazy motel, so I figured I could just crash there for the night, and check into my room the next day. Since I did not have the much vaunted Statosphere for internet access, I searched for a wireless connection. As luck would have it, the city provides 5 wireless per day through Las Vegas.net. I bought two days, figured I would check in to the Statosphere the next day and all would be well. When I got to there, I learned why my room had been such a \\"bargain\\": it came with a glorious view of some storage area where apparently the hotel keeps scrap metal. Two windows worth, no less. But that wasn't as bad as learning that the Stratosphere BLOCKS wireless providers so you have to buy theirs... at 11 a day. Flabbergasted that a ritzy (cough!) hotel would be this cheap, I realized that I would have to use the phone to make my plans for the night. Not a big deal, I have a phone card, and their phone's display said local calls were free, except that, well, they're not. When I just got a rapid dialtone whenever I dialed nine, I tried calling the front desk for a solution. They put me on hold FOREVER. I tried other numbers - the concierge, the operator, SOMETHING - to find out what was wrong with my phone so I didn;t have to sit on hold, but to no avail. The Statosphere wanted me to hold on for five minutes, no matter what. So I did, only to learn that local calls are A DOLLAR each. What's on the phone, I guess, was put there by the manufacturer, because no one in their right mind would believe a luxury hotel would charge a buck each for LOCAL calls. But the Statosphere is not like other hotels. It's far worse. So I used the cell, got to where I needed to go, and got the Hell out of there, discovering my favorite thing about the Statosphere - check out is easy and fast. I'm sure they had to do that because they get so many. Bottom line, unless you're part of the 1%, stay at Circus Circus if you're going to Las Vegas on a budget. And stay as far from the Statosphere as you can. The tower, I now believe, was put in to distract you from how horrible this place is. Never again. Choose the sentiment of this review?

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the colonization of an area by pioneer plant species. These are hardy species that can easily establish themselves in bare or disturbed areas, such as after a natural disaster, soil erosion, or human activity. Pioneer plants are often small, fast-growing, and have efficient means of reproduction, such as producing large quantities of seeds. As these pioneer plants grow, they stabilize the soil, accumulate organic matter and make the environment more hospitable for other plant species. This sets the stage for the sequence of events you described, leading to a more fertile soil, larger plants, and eventually the growth of trees.

Let's analyze each sentence in detail: 1. \\"During the late 1920s, Merzbach worked in Germany before returning to Sweden.\\" In this sentence, it is indicated that in the late 1920s, Merzbach was employed in Germany. After completing his work there, he returned to Sweden.

What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes.

As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there.

A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas.

Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). Answer this question \\"Did Zapata give up at that point?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"No, Zapata did not give up at that point. Despite facing challenges, he continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement, and when pushed to retreat, he moved the main Zapatista headquarters to Tochimilco, Puebla. He also issued an open letter to Carranza, urging him to resign his leadership for the good of the fatherland. Zapata declined to lay low as suggested by his generals, believing that his active presence at the front was crucial for maintaining the respect of his troops."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the below conversation.

In Seattle, strait-laced Matt Leland falls in love with Casey Roberts, the new girl at their high school who's from Chicago. They begin a sexual relationship. His father disapproves of this and her parents try to stop them from continuing to see each other. She deliberately sets off the fire alarm at school, knowing that there is no fire there, and is subsequently suspended. She has an argument with her parents when they tell her they are sending her to a boarding school. She takes an overdose and her parents subsequently arrange to have her committed. Matt helps Casey escape from an acute psychiatric ward, and as they run away they both deal with her borderline personality disorder. Casey is eccentric in nature.

Given statement: \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes.\\" In this statement, we are provided with three main pieces of information: 1. The subjects are young boys. 2. The action they are performing is walking. 3. The additional information about their walking is that they are wearing galoshes. A brief analysis of this statement allows us to understand the situation. We know that there are young boys who are engaged in the action of walking. As they walk, they are wearing galoshes, which are a type of rubber or waterproof boot used to protect the feet from getting wet or dirty in puddles, rain, or muddy situations. Conclusion: \\"The boys are walking.\\" In the conclusion, we are concerned with two main ideas: 1. The subjects are boys (though the age descriptor \\"young\\" has been omitted). 2. The action they are performing is walking. Given the information presented in the initial statement, we can safely conclude that \\"The boys are walking\\" holds true. We have evidence of young boys involved in the act of walking, which directly correlates to the conclusion we want to draw. The descriptor \\"young\\" has been dropped from the conclusion, but this simplified statement still communicates the core idea. Moreover, the information about the boys wearing galoshes is not relevant to the conclusion itself. It merely serves as additional context to the given statement and helps paint a clearer picture of the situation. Whether the boys are wearing galoshes or not does not change the fact they are walking, and our conclusion remains unaffected by this detail. In summary, based on the given statement \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes,\\" we can confidently conclude that \\"The boys are walking.\\" By examining the key elements within the initial statement, we are able to draw a conclusion that accurately reflects the core meaning."},{"instruction":"(options at the end).

So, we want to add 627 * x to both sides: -624 * x + 21 + 627 * x = -627 * x + 627 * x That simplifies to: 3 * x + 21 = 0 Now, let's get rid of the 21 by subtracting 21 from both sides: 3 * x = -21 Finally, to find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = -21 / 3 So, x = -7 And there you have it!

The music that emerged from the scene mixed alternative rock, psychedelic rock and electronic dance music. Artists associated with the scene included the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets, Northside, 808 State, James and The Charlatans, amongst others. At that time, the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, was a major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love. The scene is widely seen as heavily influenced by drugs, especially ecstasy (MDMA). - The Second Summer of Love is a name given to the period in 198889 in Britain, during the rise of acid house music and the euphoric explosion of unlicensed MDMA-fuelled rave parties. The term generally refers to the summers of both 1988 and 1989 when electronic dance music and the prevalence of the drug MDMA fuelled an explosion in youth culture culminating in mass free parties and the era of the rave. LSD was also widely available and popular again. The music of this era fused dance beats with a psychedelic, 1960s flavour, and the dance culture drew parallels with the hedonism and freedom of the Summer of Love in San Francisco two decades earlier. Similarities with the Sixties included fashions such as Tie-dye. The smiley logo is synonymous with this period in the UK. - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (E), is a psychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug. Desired effects include increased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 3045 minutes and last 36 hours. It is also sometimes snorted or smoked. , MDMA has no accepted medical uses. Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat. Use may also lead to depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA increases the release and slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It has stimulant and psychedelic effects. The initial increase is followed by a short-term decrease in the neurotransmitters. MDMA belongs to the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA was first made in 1912. It was used to improve psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It is often sold mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2014, between 9 and 29 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.2% to 0.6% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, but fewer than for cannabis. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010. MDMA is generally illegal in most countries. Limited exceptions are sometimes made for research. Researchers are investigating whether a few low doses of MDMA may assist in treating severe, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In November 2016, phase 3 clinical trials for PTSD were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to assess effectiveness... - Shaun William George Ryder (born 23 August 1962) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, actor, television personality, author, and newspaper columnist.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc shares slid below 29 to a new low on Tuesday as nervous investors fled the company's shares, concerned about the social network's long-term business prospects and an initial offering price that proved too rich. Shares of the No. 1 social network fell 10 percent to an all-time low of 28.65, before closing at 28.84, or down 9.6 percent. Since its market debut at 38 on May 18, the eight-year-old company has shed approximately 25 billion in value - roughly equivalent to the market capitalization of Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter of Facebook's IPO. Wall Street has harbored concerns that Facebook, while boasting nearly a billion users worldwide and dominating Internet social-networking, would have difficulty translating its growing presence on smartphones and other mobile devices into revenue. Rivals Google Inc and Apple Inc currently dominate the mobile arena. Facebook's quest to monetize mobile is spurring widespread speculation over its next moves. Technology bankers say the company would benefit from tacking on mobile operating software through an acquisition of Norway's Opera, which has been on the auction block for a while. The New York Times cited sources dredging up a longstanding rumor that Zuckerberg was pondering building a Facebook phone, and that an easy way to acquire the hardware expertise needed was to buy troubled Research in Motion. The Blackberry maker said late on Tuesday that it hired J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets to help the company and its board with a \\"strategic review. \\"They are clearly looking at smartphones and are trying to become more vertically integrated with their users,\\" said Ryan Jacob of the Jacob Internet Fund. \\"They just don't want to be another app on Google's or Apple's platform.\\" \\"Speculation that Facebook is dabbling outside their main expertise and possibly planning another large acquisition may be unsettling to some investors,\\" he added. \\"But I think options trading is behind today's drop in the shares.\\" TEMPTING OPTION Facebook options began trading on Tuesday, presenting a tempting target as more investors bet the underlying stock would head south. They piled into put and call options - granting investors the right to sell or buy stock at a certain price - marking one of the busiest debuts ever in the options market. \\"The fact that the stock has been weak on the first day of options trading means people are betting on future declines or buying insurance,\\" Jacob said. \\"Investors may want to hold the stock but are buying protection in case the price falls further.\\" Jacob said he did not buy Facebook shares in the IPO and has not bought the stock since the debut. \\"If the price is right we would consider buying,\\" he added. \\"It's not quite there yet.\\" Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc in Chicago, said she bought puts expiring in September with a strike price of 25, at a cost of 210 per contract, with each contract representing 100 shares. \\"The valuation is a complete bluff. There is still a long way to go down from here,\\" she said. \\"There will be insiders selling their shares on August 20, when the first lockout period is over. There will be a lot of shares that will hit the market and more in coming months.\\" 'TRANSITION' Analysts say apart from the challenge of earning money off smartphone and tablet users, Facebook - which relies on advertising for the majority of its revenue --may also find it difficult to lure and keep large advertisers. Days before Facebook's debut, General Motors announced it was pulling out of paid advertising on the social network, citing Facebook's unproven track record and echoing potential concerns about the lack of evidence that advertising on Facebook yielded strong returns on investment. \\"Facebook is in a transition in their business model,\\" Walter Price, portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Advantage Specialized Technology Fund, told Reuters Insider. \\"It was easy to get the first 5 to 10 percent of an advertising budget to try it on Facebook and do some brand advertising, but getting the next 5 to 10 percent, you've got to displace TV and that's a lot more difficult to do. \\"Facebook still doesn't have the metrics to prove profitability and prove growth and awareness from their platform,\\" he added. Facebook debut after an IPO that raised 16 billion was to have been the culmination of years of breakneck growth for the cultural and Internet phenomenon. But a software error on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's U.S. exchange delayed the start of trade by 30 minutes. Then, claims of selective disclosure in the days leading up to the IPO about Facebook's slowing revenue growth engulfed the company in controversy, as did perceptions among some investors that the stock had been overpriced coming out the gate. Skeptics had argued even before the botched debut and subsequent selloff that Facebook's starting valuation of more than 100 billion - about equivalent to that of Amazon.com Inc and exceeding that of Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc combined - was too high for a company that posted 1 billion in profit on revenue of 3.7 billion in 2011. Facebook stock debuted at over 100 times historical earnings versus Apple's 14 times. Despite that, many investors bet on a modest first-day pop for the company, which upended traditional technology and business models and is used by about one in seven people on the planet. \\"We've been talking about a 50 billion valuation as one that makes sense, I think that would be a stock price around 20,\\" Price said. But \\"the infrastructure that Facebook is building, and the fact that they have many advertisers that have built followers and fans on their platform, gives them a base to build a great business.\\" WHAT'S NEXT? Vague talk about Facebook's next moves in a hotly contested mobile arena may also be giving some investors pause. Rumors that the company may be considering acquiring Opera pushed the Oslo-listed shares up more than 26 percent on Tuesday. Analysts say the mobile-phone software maker could prove a crucial component in Facebook's still-patchy strategy to earn revenue from smartphones, but it could carry a price tag of as high as 1 billion. Many Wall Street analysts had also been concerned about the apparent hastiness with which Facebook concluded its 1 billion purchase of photo-sharing service Instagram, though Zuckerberg later said it had been considered for months. A industry source told Reuters on Tuesday that antitrust regulators had given Facebook notice that its proposed Instagram acquisition will get an extended review. Speculation has been rife about how Facebook might spearhead a drive into mobile advertising, in which its Instagram purchase was considered key. Talk that the social networking company might actually get into the hardware business re-surfaced after Google, whose Android OS is now the most commonly used mobile software, completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility. Bankers and analysts say BlackBerry maker RIM, left behind in the smartphone race against Apple and Samsung, might be doing shareholders a service by allowing itself to be acquired. Others worry about how Zuckerberg commands more than half of the company's voting shares through agreements with other investors, granting him near-absolute control over Facebook. The 28-year-old has so far refrained from commenting publicly about the controversy, and in fact is reportedly not even in the country. As Facebook shares hit a record low on Tuesday, photos of Zuckerberg and his new bride spread across the Internet, depicting the couple - who wed the day after Facebook debuted - touring the Sistine Chapel and sharing a fast-food meal on their honeymoon in Rome.

Facebook’s /quotes/zigman/9962609 /quotes/nls/fb FB valuation is still generous compared to most of the group. At 30 per share, Facebook trades about 55 times estimated earnings for the current fiscal year. That’s a huge premium over Google Inc. /quotes/zigman/93888 /quotes/nls/goog GOOG – it’s closest competitor – which currently trades a little less than 14 times estimated earnings for the same period.

By noon the sky had darkened to midnight blackness, causing Americans, still in the painful struggle of a prolonged war of independence, to light candles and tremble at thoughts of the Last Judgment. As the birds quieted and no storm accompanied the darkness, men and women crowded into churches, where one minister commented that \\"The people were very attentive.\\" John Greenleaf Whittier later wrote that \\"Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . . .\\" A recent study of researchers, led by Richard Guyette from the University of Missouri's Tree Ring Laboratory, has shown that vast forest fires in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and elsewhere in Canada brought this event upon New England. The scientists have discovered \\"fire scars\\" on the rings for that year, left when the heat of a wildfire has killed a part of a tree's cambium . Evidence collected also points to a drought that year. An easterly wind and low barometric pressure helped force smoke into the upper atmosphere. \\"The record fits pretty close,\\" says Guyette. \\"We had the right fuel, the drought. The conditions were all there.\\" Lacking the ability to communicate quickly over long distances, Americans in 1780 remained in the dark about the event, which had disappeared by the next day. Over the next several months, the papers carried heated debates about what brought the darkness. Some were the voices of angry prediction, such as one Massachusetts farmer who wrote, \\"Oh! Backsliding New-England, attend now to the things which belong to your peace before they are forever hid from your eyes.\\" Others gave different answers. One stated that a \\"flaming star\\" had passed between the earth and the sun. Ash, argued another commentator.

However, others have interpreted this trend as a reaction to longer working hours and the break up of more marriages. The boarding schools of fiction are presented as one long midnight feast with pillow fights making firm friendships. However, some people say the reality is children having more homesickness and a lack of individual attention. Modern boarding schools have done much to get rid of the image of the mass dormitories with 40 or more beds in one room, some going as far as providing private rooms with bathrooms. Similarly, they make great announcements for their academic advantage, particularly in light of the increase in exams, homework and university entrance requirements facing children wishing to succeed in the modern world. Alongside these more conventional schools, two types of boarding schools have also become more popular recently. Sports academies and stage schools seek to cater for children with particular interests and talents, while so-called troubled-teens have been able to turn to a range of religious or wilderness schools to solve their problematic behavior. Boarding schools allow children a safe space in which to accomplish greater control and independence over their daily lives. Teachers and staff can look after and support but they are unlikely to be over-protective. This can be a great preparation for university or for working away from home in later life as it provides an intermediate step between childhood and full independence. However, parents are a child's most natural support and best role models to learn from. If they are separated from them for long periods of time, this may damage their relationship and leave the child feeling anxious or alone.

This increases the negativity and disappointment with overall experience. 3. The reviewer notes that the \\"happy hour menu was a total bummer.\\" This implies that the food and drink options failed to meet expectations, contributing to a negative view of the establishment. 4. The selection ordered, the \\"shrimp tempura roll with a raspberry-sage tea\\", did not live up to expectation, contributing to the overall negative response.

Question: suppose less vegetation available happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect. To fully understand the implications of the supposed perturbation and its connection with the damage caused by acid rain, let us first delve into the process mentioned earlier: 1. Acid rain is produced by chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), which reach into the atmosphere. These chemicals are primarily released through the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicular emissions. 2. Upon reaching the atmosphere, these chemicals undergo numerous chemical reactions, turning into sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃). These acids then mix with rainwater, creating acid rain. 3. Acid rain falls onto the ground and can have detrimental effects on various aspects of the environment, such as soil, rock formations, and vegetation. 4. The acid rain starts to react with rocks, leading to a process known as chemical weathering. This weathering can cause rocks to break down and weaken, giving rise to the potential for erosion and environmental damage. 5. As mentioned, acid rain also destroys vegetation. Acid deposition in soils can lead to a decrease in vital nutrients and an increase in toxic elements, causing harm to plant life and impeding plant growth. 6. The lack of vegetation that results from acid rain leads to alterations in the surrounding environment, such as increased soil erosion and destabilization of ecosystems. Now, considering the question, if there is less vegetation available and this reduced vegetation coverage is assumed to be the outcome of some factor other than acid rain, it can be inferred that it would have a less effect on the damage caused by acid rain. This is primarily due to three reasons: 1. With fewer plants and vegetation in the affected areas, there would be fewer targets for acid rain to damage directly. As a result, the immediate impact of acid rain on the local vegetation and ecosystems would be reduced. 2. The reduced vegetation coverage can potentially lead to a decrease in transpiration, which in turn may affect the local water cycle. This alteration in the water cycle could result in a decreased frequency or intensity of precipitation events, meaning that less acid rain might fall in these areas. 3. Since the reduced vegetation coverage is not a direct result of acid rain, it implies that other factors such as land-use changes, deforestation, or climatic variations are responsible for this phenomenon. These factors often entail mitigation and management approaches that are different from those addressing acid rain. Therefore, the impact of acid rain must also be assessed and managed differently, considering its potential interactions with these other factors. However, it is essential to note that less damage from acid rain does not imply the overall environmental impact is reduced. The other factors responsible for decreased vegetation might have their consequences, making it necessary to continue exploring strategies that minimize acid rain emissions and monitor the long-term effects the perturbation may have."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who wrote curious incident of the dog in the nighttime?","output":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a book written by a man named Mark Haddon.

To understand this better, let's review the pH scale briefly. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral. Substances with a pH value below 7 are considered acidic, while those with a pH value above 7 are considered alkaline or basic. Each unit on the scale represents a tenfold change in acidity or basicity. Now, the pH value of apples may vary slightly depending on the variety and ripeness of the fruit. Generally speaking, apples have a pH value that ranges from approximately 3.3 to 4.0. This makes apples acidic but not as acidic as other fruits like lemons, which have a pH value of around 2.0, or oranges, which have a pH value of around 3.0 to 4.0. In summary, the pH value of apples is lower than the neutral pH value of 7, indicating that they are acidic. However, apples are considered to be mildly or barely acidic compared to other fruits, as their pH value is higher than that of more strongly acidic fruits like lemons and oranges."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.
