Hatfield was born in Wiscasset, Maine, the daughter of Philip M. Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break. In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act. In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances. In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan.","output":"This text is about Juliana Hatfield, a singer and musician.

He cautiously approached the thicket, ensuring he was far enough away from any prying eyes or possible passerby. Step 1: Jack surveyed the area, checking if anyone was around and choosing a suitable bush to hide behind for privacy. He thought, \\"It's better to be somewhere secluded, so there's no chance of someone walking in on me.\\" Step 2: Finding a large and dense bush, Jack stepped behind it and fumbled around with his belt and zipper.

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation. It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock,progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, \\"We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'.\\" Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding 250,000. Despite all the problems in its recording, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Alongside the band's mounting mainstream recognition, the band's reputation as careerists among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened. Indie rock band Pavement's 1994 song \\"Range Life\\" directly mocks the band in its lyrics, although Stephen Malkmus, lead singer of Pavement, has stated, \\"I never dissed their music. I just dissed their status.\\" Former Husker Du frontman Bob Mould called them \\"the grunge Monkees\\", and fellow Chicago musician/producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band, derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon (\\"by, of and for the mainstream\\") and concluding their ultimate insignificance. The opening track and lead single of Siamese Dream, \\"Cherub Rock\\", directly addresses Corgan's feud with the \\"indie-world\\". In 1994 Virgin released the B-sides/rarities compilation Pisces Iscariot which charted higher than Siamese Dream by reaching number four on the Billboard 200. Also released was a VHS cassette titled Vieuphoria featuring a mix of live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Following relentless touring to support the recordings, including headline slots on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour and at Reading Festival in 1995, the band took time off to write the follow-up album. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was one of their best albums recorded?","output":"One of their best albums recorded was \\"Siamese Dream.\\" As mentioned in the text: \\"Despite all the problems in its recording, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone.\\""},{"instruction":"Craft one incorrect answer.

The car-rental agency charges 30/day for a car, or 190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer. Jennie rented a car for 11 days. How much, in dollars, did she pay for the rental?","output":"To find out how much Jennie paid for the car rental, we need to consider two components: the weekly charge and the daily charge for the remaining days after the first week. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. First, let's determine the number of complete weeks in 11 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, 11 days contain 1 complete week and 4 extra days. 2. For the first week, Jennie will be charged 190. This is because the rental agency charges 190 for the first week if the rental lasts an entire week or longer. 3. Now let's determine the cost for the remaining 4 days. The agency charges 30/day for a car. To find the total cost for the next 4 days, we need to multiply the daily rate by the number of remaining days: 30/day * 4 days = 120. 4. Finally, to find the total amount Jennie paid for the rental, we need to add the cost of the first week and the cost of the remaining 4 days together: 190 (first week) + 120 (remaining days) = 310. So, Jennie paid a total of 310 for the car rental."},{"instruction":"Q:\\"Aglossa rhodalis\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Multiple identities, on the other hand, refer to a condition called dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. DID is a highly complex and controversial psychiatric disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states, each with its own enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order.

Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves.

These two figures are Sir Winston Churchill, former British Prime Minister, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States. They are human entities, specifically politicians and statesmen, who are related by blood as seventh cousins once-removed. Both Churchill and Roosevelt are well-known for their strong leadership during World War II. As crucial allies, they played an essential role in bringing about the defeat of the Axis powers and reshaping the post-war world order. Their familial connection is a fascinating aspect of their personal backgrounds. Their common ancestor dates back to the 17th century when their families diverged; Churchill is descended from the British line, and Roosevelt comes from the American line. Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965) was a British statesman, soldier, and author who served as Prime Minister twice, first from 1940 to 1945 and later from 1951 to 1955. Under his leadership, Britain was able to maintain its determination to fight against Nazi Germany and help lead the Allies to victory in World War II. He is famous for his speeches and historical writings, which contributed to boosting morale during the war and later reflecting on its impact. Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) was the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. He was elected to four consecutive terms, becoming the only U.S. president to do so. Roosevelt is notable for his leadership during the Great Depression and World War II, implementing relief and recovery programs known as the New Deal to alleviate economic struggles, and forming a critical wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. In summary, the answer to the question is a description involving two historical human entities, Sir Winston Churchill and Franklin D.

UPDATED:. 02:39 EST, 11 December 2013. The owners of DiGiorno - the nation's largest frozen pizza company - have said that they have cut all ties with a Wisconsin dairy farm after undercover video revealed sickening abuse against the cows kept there. The footage, shot by animals rights group Mercy for Animals last month, shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm in Greenleaf, beating the cows and dragging them with ropes from tractors - leaving them with gaping, bleeding wounds. Nestlé, who owns DiGiorno frozen pizza, confirmed today that they will no longer use any use cheese for their pizza from any firm supplied with milk by Wiese Brothers - as it emerged that the Wisconsin firm has fired two staff and that police are investigating the family firm. Scroll Down for Video. Sick: The animal rights group Mercy For Animals released the video on Tuesday. Director of Investigations Matt Rice says it was shot in October and November at Wiese Brothers Farm in Greenleaf, Wisconsin. Kicking out: This employee of Wiese Brothers lashes out at a cow at their Wisconsin farm while (right) this cow has a grizzly pustule on the side of its face in this video shot in October and November. Dragged: This cow is pulled by her head by a tractor along the floor as two staff members of Wiese Brothers watch. Swiss food giant Nestlé moved quickly to sever any links between them and Wiese Brothers and a spokesperson for their pizza division said they are 'outraged and deeply saddened by the mistreatment of animals shown in this video.' They confirmed that they have instructed their cheese supplier, Foremost Farms USA, that Nestlé 'will not accept any cheese made with milk from the Wiese Brothers Farm.' After viewing the horrific video which shows cows hanging from ropes and blistered with seeping sores, Foremost Farms USA declared themselves to be 'extremely disappointed.' 'To protect consumer trust and confidence in the dairy industry, we have discontinued receiving milk from the farm depicted in the video.' Horrible: This cow is bleeding heavily from an open wound and is not being treated by any employee at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin. Grim: Another cow is hoisted into the air while at Griese Brothers and frantically runs its legs to try and escape. Faced with a public relations disaster, the Wiese family said that they were 'shocked and saddened' at the footage and added they have 'zero tolerance for animal abuse.' They confirmed that the two employees seen in the video had been fired and a third removed from 'animal handling' responsibilities. 'Further action will be taken if the investigation warrants it,' said the statement. The local sheriff's department in Greenleaf said that they are investigating the alleged abuse and will be pressing charges if warranted. The video was shot undercover by a representative of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals in October and November and was then handed over to NBC News. Cruel: This cow is hanging in the air as a forklift truck operated by an employee reverses backwards. Poked pulled and prodded: This cow looks distressed as it is pulled by its head upwards by a tractor. 'No socially responsible corporation should support dairy operations that beat, kick, mutilate and neglect animals,' said MFA’s executive director, Nathan Runkle. 'Due to its complete lack of meaningful animal welfare standards, DiGiorno has allowed a culture of cruelty to flourish in its cheese supply chain.' The gruesome video reveals repeated examples of cruelty towards the livestock at Wiese Brothers farm as bleeding animals are beaten with sticks or kicked and dragged by their legs or necks. Speaking to NBC News, one livestock expert said the video showed unequivocal evidence of abuse. 'Dragging live cows, and completely suspending them with the cow lift is severe animal abuse,' said Temple Grandin, an associate professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University and an animal welfare adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reality: This calf has been separated from its mother and could possibly be killed for veal at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin. 'The actions of these people went beyond rough handling and escalated to the level of cruelty. Kicking, beating, and hard whipping of downed cows is abusive.' Brown County Shefiff's Department said they were in the midst of an investigation after being handed the footage. 'It something we’re looking into right now,' said Captain David Konrath. 'At the conclusion of the investigation we’ll give the case to the district attorney and he will make a decision about whether charges would be filed.' Pizza and the farm: DiGiorno is the most popular brand of pizza in the United States and the milk its cheese suppliers use comes from Wiese Brothers. A Wiese family spokesperson said that they were working fully with Brown County Sheriff's Department and had invited an 'independent animal care auditor from a national evaluation firm' to come to their facility and begin a review of practices within 24 hours of being made aware of the footage in on November 26. 'We are shocked and saddened to see a few of our employees not following our farm's policies for proper animal care. We have zero tolerance for animal abuse. We are committed to providing optimal care and ask all our employees to demonstrate ongoing respect for every animal at all times,' the farm said. The farm, which has 4,500 cows that produce about 350,000 pounds of milk daily, was chosen at random to investigate.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county caused less global warming? Answer:","output":"Green County caused less global warming in comparison to Brown County, owing to its utilization of alternative methods to produce energy. The energy production in Green County relied on environmentally friendly sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing the contribution to global warming. On the other hand, Brown County's energy production was primarily based on fossil fuels, which are known to release a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is one of the leading greenhouse gases and is directly responsible for global warming. Greenhouse gases trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and causing an increase in the planet's surface temperature. Using alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, or hydroelectric power, Green County successfully reduced its carbon footprint and environmental impact. Switching to clean and renewable energy sources can greatly help in tackling global warming by lowering the level of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Overall, Green County's commitment to environmentally friendly energy production led to lesser global warming compared to Brown County, which relied heavily on the combustion of fossil fuels for its energy needs.

Question 1: Why are there no wolves in circuses? Step 1: Understand the context - Wolves are wild animals that are not commonly seen in circuses. Step 2: Analyze possible reasons for the absence of wolves in circuses. This could include factors such as difficulty in domestication, training, safety of the audience, and ethical concerns. Conclusion: There are no wolves in circuses primarily because they are wild animals that are difficult to domesticate and train, and there may be safety and ethical concerns that prevent their inclusion in circus performances. Question 2: Why don't wolves perform in a circus? Step 1: Consider the similarities with the previous question - This question seems to be exploring the same concept as the first question but with different phrasing.

The French were routed and the III Corps captured Vionville, blocking any further escape attempts to the west. Once blocked from retreat, the French in the fortress of Metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe. The battle soon erupted, and III Corps was shattered by incessant cavalry charges, losing over half its soldiers. The German Official History recorded 15,780 casualties and French casualties of 13,761 men. With battle at Metz, what factor shattered the efforts of III Corps?","output":"The efforts of the III Corps in the battle at Metz during the Franco-Prussian War were shattered due to incessant cavalry charges by the French forces. Despite launching a risky attack when they were outnumbered four to one, the III Corps managed to route the French and capture Vionville, thus blocking any further French escape attempts to the west. Trapped in the fortress of Metz, the French had no other option but to engage in a fight that resulted in a significant and fast-paced confrontation. The III Corps found themselves in an intense situation amid the last major cavalry engagement in Western Europe, which was characterized by sharp, swift, and persistent attacks from the French cavalry. As specified in the text, these incessant cavalry charges had a catastrophic impact on the III Corps, resulting in over half their soldiers' loss. Being on the receiving end of these relentless charges ravaged the III Corps' ranks and greatly hampered their ability to maintain a strong, cohesive fighting force. Cavalry charges historically are particularly devastating as they usually utilize the element of surprise and the momentum of the heavy horsemen to inflict considerable physical and psychological damage on enemy forces. A well-executed cavalry charge typically triggered confusion and disarray in enemy ranks making it difficult for them to respond quickly and effectively. In the case of the battle at Metz, these repeated cavalry charges proved to be a decisive factor contributing to the shattering of the III Corps' efforts. The German Official History further highlights the scale of this devastation by recording 15,780 casualties for the III Corps, which is a substantial number, indicating the severity of the shattering they experienced. Hence, it can be concluded that the III Corps' efforts were shattered in the battle of Metz primarily due to the relentless and aggressive cavalry charges launched by the French forces after getting trapped in the fortress of Metz. These charges resulted in a tremendous loss of soldiers for the III Corps, effectively obstructing their attempts to maintain their captured position at Vionville and halting any further progression."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = The Rice Boat, food = Fast food, priceRange = high, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes, near = Express by Holiday Inn Sentence:","output":"The Rice Boat, a riverside fast food restaurant with a high price range, offers a family-friendly environment near the Express by Holiday Inn, but it has a disappointing 1 out of 5 customer rating."},{"instruction":"\\"unbelievable \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived -- Options: A. negative.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Q: Neoplastic cells are genetically unstable. Strategies that target pathways affecting genome instability can be exploited to disrupt tumor cell growth, potentially with limited consequences to normal cells. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is one type of genome instability characterized by mitotic defects that increase the rate of chromosome mis-segregation. CIN is frequently caused by extra centrosomes that transiently disrupt normal bipolar spindle geometry needed for accurate chromosome segregation. Tumor cells survive with extra centrosomes because of biochemical pathways that cluster centrosomes and promote chromosome segregation on bipolar spindles. Recent work shows that targeted inhibition of these pathways prevents centrosome clustering and forces chromosomes to segregate to multiple daughter cells, an event triggering apoptosis that we refer to as anaphase catastrophe. Anaphase catastrophe specifically kills tumor cells with more than 2 centrosomes. This death program can occur after genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and is augmented by combined treatment with a microtubule inhibitor. This proapoptotic effect occurs despite the presence of ras mutations in cancer cells. Anaphase catastrophe is a previously unrecognized mechanism that can be pharmacologically induced for apoptotic death of cancer cells and is, therefore, appealing to engage for cancer therapy and prevention.

Immediately report the car accident to your insurance company. Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage. The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible. Particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident, hiring a lawyer is a good idea. A lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured, or defend you if the other motorist was injured. Keep records of any hospital visits, tests, prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. This information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney. If the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit, you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and/or lost wages, as well as medical treatment. Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life.

It is an award banquet for a sub captain Thomsen (Otto Sander), who just received a commendation, as well as a sending off for U-96's crew. Various scenes of debauchery play out.

The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path.

Would \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government , and finally published as part of a code .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose your answer from: (1). No; (2). Yes; Answer:","output":"2. Yes, the statement \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government, and finally published as part of a code.\\" is a reasonable answer. However, to provide a detailed and long explanation, we should delve deeper into the topic. Statutes are formal written enactments of a legislative authority that govern a city, state, or country. They are formed through a legislative process involving a series of steps that vary depending on the jurisdiction. While the specific process may differ from one country to another, there are general stages that can be observed. 1. Proposal or introduction: A legislator, sometimes called a lawmaker or a member of parliament, proposes a new statute or an amendment to an existing one. The proposal may originate from the executive branch of the government, interest groups, or citizens. In some countries, the executive branch has the power to propose legislation, while in others, only members of the legislative branch can do so. 2. Review and debate: Once the proposed statute is introduced, it is often assigned to a committee for further review. This committee may hold public hearings and consult with experts on the subject matter to gather relevant information and input. After the committee's review, the proposed statute may be amended or modified to address any potential issues or concerns. Then, it is brought to the floor of the legislative chamber, where members debate and discuss the merits of the proposed statute. 3. Voting and approval: Once the debate concludes, members of the legislature vote on whether to pass the proposed statute. If it receives a majority vote in the legislative chamber, the statute moves to the next chamber (if there is one, as in bicameral legislatures) for further debate and voting. If it is approved by both chambers, it proceeds to the highest executive in the government for their assent. 4. Executive assent: The highest executive, such as a president, prime minister, or governor, holds the power to approve or veto the proposed statute. If they approve it, the statute becomes law. However, if they veto it, it is sent back to the legislative body. In some jurisdictions, the legislature may override the veto through a higher majority vote. 5. Publication and codification: After the statute has been assented to by the highest executive, it is officially published and becomes part of the legal code. This process usually involves incorporating the statute into an existing system of laws, organized by subject matter, and making it available to the public. Once published, the statute takes effect either immediately or on a specified date. While variations exist between countries, the process of forming statutes generally follows these steps. Thus, the given statement reasonably describes the journey of a proposed statute becoming law and being included in a code."},{"instruction":"We need to tackle credit; we need to help public buyers back into the market to buy the green buses, the green trucks, the green cars - after all, there will be things following through there.

A:","output":"In the movie Haute Tension, there are a few main characters who could be considered as being in a psychiatric hospital room. However, none of these characters are explicitly shown to be in a psychiatric hospital room within the context provided. 1. Marie (Cécile de France) - Marie is one of the college girlfriends who traveled with Alex to stay at her parent's house for the weekend. She's an important character in the story as she tries to protect and save Alex from the serial killer. Throughout the movie, Marie's mental state is brought into question, as she develops a strong will and determination to save her friend while facing several horrifying and traumatising experiences. 2. Alex (Maïwenn Le Besco) - Alex is the other college girlfriend, and she is the one who is kidnapped by the killer. She goes through a lot of physical and psychological trauma, as she witnesses her family being brutally murdered and subsequently being in constant danger herself. Although some might argue that she would need psychological help processing the events of the story, there is no mention of her being in a psychiatric hospital. 3. The serial killer (Philippe Nahon) - The real antagonist of the movie, the serial killer is responsible for the gruesome and brutal murders in the story. His motive and reasons behind his actions are ambiguous, and his level of mental stability is implied to be rather questionable, but there is no indication that he is in a psychiatric hospital room. 4. Alex's parents and younger brother - All of them meet tragic ends in this story, so they definitely are not in a psychiatric hospital room. Given the context provided and the events that take place throughout the movie, it is not possible to definitively determine whether any characters end up in a psychiatric hospital room.

Email is a widely-used method for companies to directly communicate advertisements and promotions to consumers. While other options like bus (A), la ville (B, which means \\"the city\\" in French), web page (C), and carrier pigeon (E) do exist, they are not as direct or effective as email marketing. Bus advertisements and posting banners in the city, for example, can only reach people in a specific location and may not target the desired audience effectively. Web pages can display ads, but they require the user to visit that specific page first. Carrier pigeons might be an amusing and creative idea, but it is not practical nor widely used in modern advertising. Email allows companies to send targeted promotional messages, newsletters, and updates to a specific audience who have opted into receiving them. This helps ensure that the message reaches the right people, and they can be tailored to the consumers' needs and preferences.

While Africa is the correct continent, it's not specific enough as they don't live everywhere in Africa.

Step 3: Gather information: Research RZA and his music to understand his genre, main platforms, and potential connections to PornHub. Step 4: Verify information on PornHub: Check the PornHub platform for any mention or availability of RZA's music. After following these steps, I found that RZA is a musician and a member of the Wu-Tang Clan, primarily known for their hip-hop music. PornHub is an adult video sharing and pornography website. As per their Content Guidelines, PornHub primarily hosts content suitable for adult audiences. While PornHub is not a music streaming platform, it may have content that features music, including music produced by different artists. Therefore, it is possible, although not very probable, that RZA's music could be heard on PornHub, depending on whether any uploaded videos feature his music in the background or if he has specifically collaborated with the platform. Rationale: The statement's verifiability depends on whether RZA's music has been uploaded to PornHub or can be heard in the background of any videos on the platform. Answer: Yes, it is a verifiable fact, but it requires further research and direct verification on the platform."},{"instruction":"@mrrickybell sorry u hv to witness this LOL LA WE GOT IT!!!

Sadly, due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted about 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several Oscars to \\"prove\\" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s. This UPA film is one of the early ones. The characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly--simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items). As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. It's the traditional \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" story and because of the shootings and all, it's probably not a great film for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good film for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank (which I am, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very, very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art--just very, very quickly made cartoons.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, answer the following question. 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich?

The probability that exactly two dice show the same number on them is Options: (A) 5/9 (B) 5/12 (C) 1/36 (D) 7/12 (E) 4/9 Some stream of consciousness:","output":"To find the probability of exactly two dice showing the same number, we will first find the total number of possible outcomes and then find the number of favorable outcomes. Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes. When three 6-faced dice are thrown together, we have a total of 6×6×6=216 possible outcomes, since each die has 6 sides. Step 2: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes. There are a few cases to consider when calculating the favorable outcomes: Case 1: Two dice show the same number, and the third shows a different number. For this case, we first choose which two dice will show the same number. There are 3 ways to select two dice from three (either the first two, the last two, or the first and the third). Then, we select the common number for the two dice, which can be any of the 6 numbers. Finally, we choose the number for the third die; it cannot match the common number, so there are 5 choices for this number. In total, this case has 3×6×5=90 favorable outcomes. Case 2: All three dice show the same number. This is not a favorable case, as we want only two dice to show the same number. There are 6 outcomes in this case, as each side of the die can be the common number, but none of them will be favorable for our desired condition. Finally, we subtract the outcomes from Case 2 from the outcomes in Case 1: 90 - 6 = 84 favorable outcomes, as we are not considering cases where all three dice have the same number. Step 3: Calculate the probability. The probability of exactly two dice showing the same number is the ratio between the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes: P(exactly two dice show the same number) = 84/216 = 7/36 However, none of the given options match the calculated probability. In this case, there must be an error in the options, as the correct probability should be 7/36."},{"instruction":"That day, my mother picked me up from school, wearing the yellow sundress and shawl I remembered from our trip with Father the year before. She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\\"Just like Lena Horne,\\" my friend Chloe had once said, \\"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning.

Средний класс все еще продолжает надеяться на то, что можно спасти свои сбережения, однако эти деньги, находящиеся в заморозке на банковских счетах нации, вряд ли когда-нибудь будут доступны кому-либо. Это ставит их в крайне непростое материальное положение, так как они отчасти или полностью лишены своих средств к существованию. Такая ситуация ставит под угрозу социальное положение среднего класса, и связана с различными негативными последствиями. Во-первых, стабильность экономики начинает рушиться, так как люди все больше и больше опасаются за свое финансовое будущее. Это может привести к увеличению недоверия к банковским учреждениям и даже к протестам и массовым выступлениям, особенно если сбережения небольшие и семьям едва хватает на проживание. Во-вторых, затяжной кризис с замороженными сбережениями может привести к долгосрочному снижению уровня жизни среднего класса. Семьи становятся вынуждены возвращаться к дешевому и низкокачественному потреблению, что в свою очередь ухудшает качество жизни и оказывает сильное воздействие на рынок, на который средний класс тратит большую часть своих средств. В-третьих, такие тенденции сказываются на социальной напряженности и психологическом состоянии людей. Когда средний класс оказывается в затруднительной ситуации из-за недоступности своих сбережений, это вызывает повышенные уровни стресса и обеспокоенности, что косвенно влияет на здоровье психики. В результате общественное недоволство растет, а межклассовые разногласия могут усилиться.

Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. Context: In an interview with Easy Mix radio host Tim Roxborough on 1 September 2009, Barry's 63rd birthday, Barry commented on future tours saying that \\"they will be back\\"; but in an agreement with Warner/Rhino they would not make an announcement at that time. On 7 September 2009, Robin disclosed to Jonathan Agnew that he had been in touch with Barry and that they had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and \\"perform again\\". Barry and Robin performed on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing on 31 October 2009 and appeared on ABC-TV's Dancing with the Stars on 17 November 2009. On 15 March 2010, Barry and Robin inducted the Swedish group ABBA into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 26 May 2010, the two made a surprise appearance on the ninth-season finale of American Idol. On 20 November 2011 it was announced that Robin Gibb, at 61 years old, had been diagnosed with liver cancer, a condition he had become aware of several months earlier. He had become noticeably thinner in previous months and had to cancel several appearances due to issues with severe abdominal pain. On 13 February 2012, Robin joined British military trio the Soldiers for the Coming Home charity concert at the London Palladium, in support of injured servicemen. It was his first public appearance for almost five months and his final. On 14 April 2012, it was reported that Robin had contracted pneumonia in a Chelsea hospital and was in a coma. Although he came out of his coma on 20 April 2012, his condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died on 20 May 2012 of liver and kidney failure. With Robin's death, Barry became the last surviving Gibb brother, and the Bee Gees dissolved as a musical group. Question: When did they return to performing?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Bee Gees, consisting of Barry and Robin Gibb, returned to performing in 2009, as indicated by their appearances on various shows and events.

Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. - Epic film is a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythic event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history. - An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation \\"only\\" refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well. - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception. - Grand opera is a genre of 19th-century opera generally in four or five acts, characterized by large-scale casts and orchestras, and (in their original productions) lavish and spectacular design and stage effects, normally with plots based on or around dramatic historic events. The term is particularly applied (sometimes specifically using in its French language equivalent grand opéra) to certain productions of the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850; 'grand opéra' has sometimes been used to denote the Paris Opéra itself. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A background actor or extra is a performer in a film , television show , stage , musical , opera or ballet production , who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging ( silent ) capacity , usually in the background ( for example , in an audience or busy street scene ) . War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers : some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members ( hence the term ' cast of thousands ' ) . Likewise , grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions . On a film or TV set , background actors are usually referred to as \`\` background talent '' , \`\` background performers '' , \`\` background artists '' , \`\` background cast members '' or simply \`\` background '' while the term \`\` extra '' is rarely used . In a stage production , background actors are commonly referred to as \`\` supernumeraries '' . In opera and ballet , they are called either \`\` extras '' or \`\` supers '' . - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot.

Let's break it down: 1. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, does exist as a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. 2. Influenza can be fatal, especially for certain high-risk groups like young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems or certain chronic health conditions. 3. However, the part about treating influenza with antibiotics is false. As influenza is caused by viruses (Influenza A, B, and C), antibiotics, which are designed to target bacterial infections, are not effective in treating the flu. Instead, antiviral medications are used to manage flu symptoms, reduce the severity of the illness, and shorten the recovery period. These medications are most effective when taken within the first 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. It is essential to understand that antibiotics should not be misused or overused for viral infections as it can lead to antibiotic resistance, which reduces their effectiveness in treating bacterial infections when needed. In conclusion, the full statement should be revised as: \\"Influenza exists as a potentially fatal disease that must be treated with antiviral medications, not antibiotics.\\""},{"instruction":"Q:I was once distinctly unsettled by a utility man who called to read the gas meter. We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye.

This task is highly dependent on understanding and manipulating specific physical objects. Let's delve into the details to understand how this process requires knowledge and handling of physical objects. 1. Understanding the Physical Objects: Ikea furniture comes in a flat pack that includes all the disparate components required to assemble the final product. These components can vary greatly in size, shape, and purpose. Larger panels may form the majority structure of the furniture, such as the sides of a cabinet or the top of a table, while smaller pieces like screws, bolts, and cam locks are necessary to hold these larger parts together. 2. Identifying the Objects: The assembly manuals provided by Ikea include illustrations of each part needed for the assembly. An assembler must be able to look at these illustrations and correctly identify each real-world equivalent within the assortment of materials provided. This not only requires the ability to visually identify the parts, but also often to differentiate them based on small variations in size or shape. 3. Using the Appropriate Tools: Ikea furniture assembly often necessitates the use of specific tools, such as Allen keys and screwdrivers. Knowledge of how to use these tools, which end to use, what each tool does, and when to use them is essential for successful assembly. 4. Understanding the Assembly Process: The process of assembly often involves an understanding of more abstract physical principles as well. Knowing that a screw must first pass through a washer before it is put into the hole or understanding that a cam bolt needs to be inserted in a specific direction for the cam lock to work requires an understanding of how these individual components interact with each other in physical space. 5. Physical Manipulation of the Objects: All of this knowledge must be backed up with the physical ability to manipulate the objects as needed. This includes the fine motor skills necessary to align screws with holes, turn screws, tighten bolts, and so on. It also involves the larger physical abilities necessary to hold larger pieces steady, piece them together correctly, and sometimes to apply a reasonable amount of force to ensure the pieces fit together as they should. 6. Troubleshooting: An understanding of these physical objects and their characteristics also proves crucial if and when troubleshooting is needed during the assembly process. If something doesn't fit right or a certain piece is not behaving as it should, the assembler needs to get creative with their knowledge of the physical components, their roles, and how they fit together. To summarize, the assembly of Ikea furniture as a task is comprehensive in how it requires knowledge of physical objects. It involves object identification, tool usage, understanding and application of physical principles, fine and gross motor skills, and problem-solving abilities. Despite seeming like a simple task at first glance, it actually showcases the complexity that can arise when dealing with physical objects and the multitude of ways in which knowledge of these objects can be required in a given task."},{"instruction":"Leo: Premise: \\"Three young men wearing blue jeans stand in front of a garage while having a conversation.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Three guys talking about starting a garage rock band.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"If a richer cake is desired, it means that more ingredients and resources will be used in the production of the cake. In the context of this question, we can assume that the production of more chemical compounds is directly linked to the production of a richer cake. So, if a richer cake is desired, it will likely result in more chemical compounds being produced. Considering the process mentioned previously, the increased production of chemical compounds will result in an increased release of these compounds into the air. As these compounds rise into the atmosphere and mix with elements in clouds, it is likely that the acidity of the rain will be more affected due to the higher concentration of chemical compounds. This means that there could be a higher likelihood of the affected rain harming natural and man-made objects, as the acidic content will be more potent. Therefore, more acid rain can be expected with the production of a richer cake. Now, let's discuss the second effect mentioned; the mixing of chemical compounds with elements in clouds. As previously mentioned, a higher concentration of chemical compounds released into the atmosphere will emerge as a result of producing a richer cake. This increased presence of chemical compounds in the air will lead to a higher probability of these compounds reacting with the elements in clouds. Consequently, more cloud formations may be affected by the presence of chemical compounds, leading to a potentially higher number of instances where the affected rain falls to the earth. In summary, by desiring a richer cake, more chemical compounds will be produced, which will in turn affect both the acidic content of rain and the likelihood of more clouds being affected by these chemical compounds. This will have a more significant effect on the potential harm that acid rain can cause to natural and man-made objects."},{"instruction":"Youcanplayitforalimitedtime.Purchasingissimple,fastandsecure!BehindtheReflectionispublishedbyBigFishGamesonFeb4th2011.Bigfishgamecluballowsyoutobuyallgamesupto65%offthemarketprice,BehindtheReflectionthatnormallyprice19.95cancostyouaslowas6.99!

Answer:","output":"Vincent van Gogh, one of the most iconic and influential painters in the history of Western art, employed a variety of techniques in his paintings that contributed to his unique style and artistic vision. While it is difficult to pinpoint a single technique used by Van Gogh, his oeuvre is characterized by a combination of methods that can be analyzed from different perspectives, such as colors, brushwork, and subject matter. Here, we will explore some of the most significant techniques that define Van Gogh's art. 1. Color: Van Gogh is renowned for his bold, expressive use of color as a vehicle for conveying emotions and personal experiences. Instead of adhering to realistic color palettes, he opted for vibrant, contrasting hues that heightened the visual impact of his work. In particular, Van Gogh was influenced by the color theories of Charles Blanc and Michel Eugène Chevreul, which encouraged the juxtaposition of complementary colors to intensify their vibrancy. This technique is especially evident in paintings like \\"The Starry Night,\\" where the swirling blues and yellows create a dynamic relationship. 2. Impasto: One of the most recognizable aspects of Van Gogh's style is his impasto technique, which involves the application of thick layers of paint to create texture and dimensionality on the canvas. This build-up of paint was achieved using a palette knife or heavily-loaded brushes, resulting in a rough, sculptural surface that conveyed a sense of immediacy and movement. The impasto technique not only allowed Van Gogh to capture the essence of his subject matter, but also contributed to the emotional intensity of his works. 3. Brushwork: Van Gogh's brushwork is characterized by bold, rhythmic strokes that exude energy and dynamism. He often employed a variety of stroke techniques—ranging from short, rapid dashes to long, sinuous lines—to achieve a richly diversified surface. This energetic brushwork enhanced the sense of movement and life in his paintings, particularly in his landscapes and still lifes. Van Gogh also employed \\"sgraffito,\\" a method of scratching through layers of wet paint to reveal the underlying colors, thereby adding complexity and depth to his compositions. 4. Pointillism and Divisionism: While Van Gogh did not strictly adhere to the principles of Pointillism or Divisionism, he was undoubtedly influenced by these techniques popularized by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Both methods involved the use of small, distinct dots or strokes of color to create a visual blend when viewed from a distance. Van Gogh experimented with these techniques, notably in his painting \\"Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat,\\" where he applied short, stippled brushstrokes to convey light and shadow. 5. Japanese art influence: Van Gogh was deeply inspired by Japanese woodblock prints, known as \\"ukiyo-e,\\" which he encountered and collected during his time in Paris. He admired their bold designs, strong outlines, and flat areas of vibrant color, incorporating these elements into his own work. Van Gogh's fascination with Japanese art not only affected his compositional style, but also his choice of subject matter, as seen in his numerous paintings of flowering trees, such as \\"Almond Blossom.\\" 6. The \\"Peasant\\" genre and the \\"Human Condition\\": Van Gogh sought to depict the simplicity and beauty of everyday life, focusing on the rural working class, often referred to as the \\"Peasant\\" genre. His pieces aim to evoke a sense of empathy and dignity towards his subjects, portraying their harsh realities with a sense of authenticity and emotion. This is exemplified in paintings such as \\"The Potato Eaters,\\" where Van Gogh captures the humanity in the faces of the family members sharing a meal. In conclusion, Van Gogh's paintings embody a dynamic fusion of techniques that include the use of bold colors, impasto textures, energetic brushwork, and an admiration for the natural world and the human condition. His groundbreaking approach to art laid the foundation for the Expressionist movement, and his work continues to inspire and captivate audiences to this day."},{"instruction":"What is afghanistan money called?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose If there is a drought happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER caverns. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, in this case a drought, can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of small or less caverns. Direct effects: 1. Reduced water availability: A drought leads to a significant reduction in water available on the surface. This means that less water will seep below the soil and come into contact with the rocks, which reduces the water's ability to carve through the rock over time. 2. Slower process of cavern formation: Due to less water seeping into the ground, the process of cavern formation will potentially slow down. The rocks may take much longer to dissolve, and the space within the rock might not grow as rapidly, resulting in smaller or fewer caverns. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in the ecosystem: Drought can lead to various environmental changes, such as reduced vegetation growth and the death of organisms that help break down rocks.

Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship. We even need to respect our enemies because they help us to grow up and become stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps to do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them.

Yes or no? Answer: Subject complements are typically not clause arguments , nor are they clause adjuncts . Question: how do you use a subjective complement A:","output":"Using a subject complement correctly in a sentence involves having a clear understanding of what a subject complement is, its various types, and the grammatical structures in which it appears. A subject complement is a word or a group of words that follows a linking verb (e.g., \\"to be,\\" \\"to become,\\" \\"to seem\\") and provides additional information about the subject of the sentence. Subject complements can function either to rename the subject (known as predicate nominatives) or to describe the subject (known as predicate adjectives). There are two main types of subject complements: 1. Predicate Nominatives: These are nouns or pronouns that function to rename the subject of the sentence and are connected to the subject by a linking verb. They equate the subject with another noun or pronoun that provides additional identification. Example: Julia is a teacher. In this sentence, \\"Julia\\" (subject) is connected to \\"teacher\\" (predicate nominative) by the linking verb \\"is.\\" The predicate nominative \\"teacher\\" renames the subject \\"Julia\\" and gives further information about her role. 2. Predicate Adjectives: These are adjectives that follow a linking verb and provide a description of the subject. Example: The flowers smell beautiful. In this sentence, \\"flowers\\" (subject) is connected to \\"beautiful\\" (predicate adjective) by the linking verb \\"smell.\\" The predicate adjective \\"beautiful\\" describes the characteristics of the subject \\"flowers.\\" To use a subject complement effectively, follow these steps: 1. Determine the subject of the sentence. Identify the noun or pronoun that the sentence is about. 2. Use a linking verb. Choose an appropriate linking verb (e.g., \\"to be,\\" \\"to become,\\" \\"to seem\\") to connect the subject with the subject complement. Remember that the linking verb must agree with the subject in number and tense. 3. Choose either a predicate nominative or a predicate adjective. Decide whether you want to rename the subject or provide a description. Use a noun or pronoun for predicate nominatives and an adjective for predicate adjectives. 4. Check for agreement and correct grammar. Ensure that the subject and the subject complement agree in gender (where relevant) and that the sentence is grammatically correct. By considering these guidelines, you can effectively use subject complements to enhance your writing and create clear, precise sentences that convey additional information about the subject."},{"instruction":"Question: What places can you visit in france?

Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which has a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rain forest is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like.

As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off. Meanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other.

Stuttgart's mayor urged residents to use public transport or electric taxis, or to form carpools. Stuttgart is the first city in Germany to issue an official alarm over levels of polluting particles in the air. On Monday, levels of harmful PM10 particles in Stuttgart reached 89 micrograms per cubic meter - nearly double the safe maximum of 50 micrograms, according to the regional environment agency for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In a statement (in German), the city website urged residents to use public transport, electric taxis, or form carpools. Some 500,000 car journeys are made each day in Stuttgart - the home of the famous Daimler and Porsche brands. In a statement (in German), the city council also asked employers to let staff work flexible hours or even from home. It advised against using wood-burning stoves which could increase pollution levels. \\"The aim is to improve the quality of life in Stuttgart,\\" the statement said. Authorities acted after meteorologists warned there was a danger that cancer-causing particles would be trapped in the air above the city for several days. They said it was because a layer of warm air higher up would prevent the particle-rich colder air near the ground from rising out of the city.

You're never too old to play Nintendo Wii-Fit – because it helps keep older people on their feet, claim researchers. Those prone to falling have most to gain from the popular computer game console, which simulates sports such as tennis, bowling and boxing. A study shows it benefits those too frail to take part in conventional physiotherapy because they are not strong or fit enough. They tried to make me go to rehab: Playing a Nintendo Wii Fit takes 30 per cent less energy than physio, while improving balance and coordination. Playing Wii-Fit games uses 30 per cent less energy than physio treatment, but improves the balance and co-ordination needed to avoid falls. Researchers Dr Murray Griffin and Dr Matt Taylor, from the School of Biological Sciences at Essex University, studied 20 pensioners who had suffered heart problems. Keeping active: Nintento Wii. In the study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the volunteers used a Wii-Fit balance board to play co-ordination and ski jump games. Talking about the finding that the volunteers used less energy, Dr Griffin said: ‘This offers a real hope to some of the most vulnerable and elderly people in society whose frailty seriously impacts on their quality of life.’ Recurrent fallers cost the NHS nearly £1.7billion a year in hospital admissions and long-term care costs. Not only can it cause broken bones and other physical damage, fallers are often left feeling anxious and less likely to move about. This can have a negative effect on their quality of life and lead to depression. It is thought the effect of Wii exercise on the brain may be similar to real exercise, which can boost levels of the feelgood chemical dopamine. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about how playing Nintendo Wii-Fit can be good for older people because it helps them stay on their feet and not fall as much.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Thomas Duffy was 14-months-old when he died after going into cardiac arrest at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire in March 2011. A coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure' after they failed to recognise the symptoms of the condition when his parents, Jo and John Duffy, took him into the A&E department as he struggled to breathe. Speaking today, Mr and Mrs Duffy today said that they have finally received justice, following a three-year battle to find out the truth surrounding their infant son's death. The hospital trust responsible has since apologised for the poor standard of care Thomas received. Thomas Duffy died from a cardiac arrest at just 14 months old after doctors repeatedly failed to diagnose an underlying heart condition. Parents Jo and John Duffy, 36 and 39, (pictured with their son Luke) underwent three inquests to battle for a fair and accurate public account of what happened to their son. At the latest inquest, a coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure' An inquest held in June 2011, three months after Thomas' death, found that he died of natural causes. But his parents fought successfully to have the ruling overturned, concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence during the proceedings. A second inquest was held in December last year, but it had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence. Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hope that their case will encourage changes to ensure other parents do not suffer what they have been through. They said: 'Thomas was an energetic 14-month-old boy - he was a proper boy. 'He did everything you'd expect him to do the week before going into hospital - he was standing on his rocking chair, climbing up the stairs. 'We wouldn't want any other families to have to go through what we have since Thomas' death and hope by our actions we can help other children and their families in the future.' Thomas was born on January 21, 2010, but within a year his parents were taking him to the GP on a weekly basis for viruses and infections. Two days before he died, Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching. Mr and Mrs Duffy took him to the GP as usual, but were reassured by two different family doctors that he was healthy and 'thriving'. Eight hours later he began to struggle to breathe, and Mr and Mrs Duffy rushed to the A&E department at their local hospital. January 21, 2010: Baby Thomas Duffy was born healthy after a normal pregnancy. July 2010: Thomas started to suffer from viral symptoms including a wheeze, a cough and diarrhoea. The GP diagnosed an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). August 2010 - December 2010: Thomas was repeatedly taken to the GP where doctors diagnosed URTIs, chest infections and bronchiolitis. He was prescribed inhalers and regular antibiotics. January 2011: Thomas became increasingly unwell and his parents were attending his GP surgery on almost a weekly basis. He was never referred for further investigations. February 2011: Thomas deteriorated and suffered from frequent vomiting. He was diagnosed with an ear infection, followed by oral thrush, a URTI and a chest infection throughout February. March 2011: Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching. The family were again reassured by the GP on both March 17 and 18. March 19, 2011: Thomas’ breathing became laboured and the family attended A&E. His enlarged heart went undiagnosed and he suffered a cardiac arrest and died. He was treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis- blood poisoning – as his condition deteriorated. He seemed to improve with the treatment, but hours later suffered a cardiac arrest and died. John Ellery, the assistant coroner in Shropshire concluded that Thomas died from an underlying heart condition that should have been diagnosed much earlier. If appropriate treatment had been given, Thomas would not have died when he did, he added. Mr Ellery, who was sitting at Stourport Coroners Court, said a post-mortem found Thomas was suffering from a condition affecting the main pumping chamber of heart. But he said the life-threatening problem should have been identified by a paediatrician when he was brought into A&E at the Alexandra Hospital. The coroner also criticised the hospital's on-call paediatrician for not attending despite repeated requests by nursing staff - saying it amounted to a 'gross failure'. Mr Ellery said he planned to write to the Trust Development Agency and NHS England to ensure that lessons were learnt from Thomas's death. It was the third inquest Mr and Mrs Duffy have been forced to undergo to get a public account of their son's death, that they felt was accurate and fair. The first inquest was held in June 2011 and came to the conclusion Thomas died of natural causes. But the verdict was quashed by a judicial review brought by the couple, who were concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence. And a second inquest, held in December last year, had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence. Speaking after the inquest, Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hoped Thomas's case would prevent other couples from going through a similar ordeal. Mrs Duffy said parents were repeatedly told Thomas's illnesses, including frequent chest infections, were normal for a child of his age. Mr and Mrs Duffy said Thomas was a 'cheeky - a wonderful little boy' 'Every time we went to the GP they said he was a normal, healthy child and he was never referred for a routine hospital appointment' she said. 'On the two days leading up to Thomas's death he was seen twice by the GP and considered a thriving child. 'But just eight to 10 hours later we had to rush him to hospital with severe breathing difficulties. 'On admission Thomas was originally treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis as his condition deteriorated. 'After a morning of intense treatment we were informed Thomas was in a stable condition but an hour or so later he suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and died. 'It was only after a post-mortem examination that we learned of Thomas's heart condition.' The couple lived in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire when Thomas passed away in March 2011 but have since moved to Shirley, near Solihull in the West Midlands. After Thomas's death they went on to have another son, Luke, now two, and Mrs Duffy is due to give birth to their third child next month. 'Luke has been our tonic. He was the focus we needed to move on and now we are looking forward to our third baby next month.' the couple said. Paying tribute to Thomas, the couple added: 'Thomas was just amazing. He enjoyed everything about life and he had a wonderful smile - everywhere he went everyone would comment on his beautiful smile. 'He was cheeky - a wonderful little boy.' Penny Venables, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, has now issued an apology to the family. She said: 'We accept the coroner's conclusions and we deeply regret that, in this case, we did get things wrong. 'In the three and a half years since Thomas's death the trust has made significant changes to ensure that the issues highlighted will not be repeated.' She added the coroner had said he was reassured lessons had been learned from Thomas's death and the trust had offered to meet with the parents to discuss measures which had put in place to avoid a repeat of the tragedy. Kay Kelly, a solicitor at Lanyon Bowdler who represented Mr and Mrs Duffy, said: 'The parents of baby Thomas have been forced to go through three separate inquests to gain the answers to their questions as to how and why their beautiful baby son died.' The hospital trust who run the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, have apologised to the family and said that they 'did get things wrong' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. 14-month-old Thomas Duffy died from an undiagnosed life-threatening heart condition after doctors repeatedly failed to recognize the symptoms. 2.

A zero is formed by a multiple of 10, which is a product of 2 and 5. Since there are more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, we should count the number of factors of 5 in 200!. To do this, we must divide 200 by powers of 5 and sum up the results. 200/5 = 40 (there are 40 multiples of 5 within 200) 200/25 = 8 (there are 8 multiples of 25 within 200) Thus, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 factors of 5 in the product of 200!.

Students were allegedly told if they didn’t comply, they would not receive help with classwork or fail the class. Shelvin also reportedly told the bullied juvenile to “go and kill yourself.” The sheriff says Tracy Gallow is the teacher’s aide who replaced Shelvin when she was taken off school grounds.

Their debut album, \\"One Touch\\", was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label. With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums. In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, \\"Sweet 7\\", in 2010, after which they signed to RCA Records, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In 2013, Ewen confessed that the Sugababes had split two years earlier. The original line-up of the band reformed in 2011, under the new name Mutya Keisha Siobhan. - The 23rd Annual Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (generally known as ARIA Music Awards or simply The ARIAs) took place on 26 November 2009 at the Acer Arena at the Sydney Olympic Park complex.

Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best. Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential. Besides, the public liked a good, simple romance. Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write.

While my mom wanted money, selling the others to anyone.(there was 11 in the litter) I cared for their safety and happiness and quality of life. They were my everything when I had nothing. I gave them away to a animal charity organization for free. My mom bitched at me for not getting money for them.

From this data, we can infer that Annet Artani has experience working with high-profile artists in the music industry. Although the statement refers to a specific song collaboration, it can be reasonably assumed that she may have co-written other songs throughout her career. In the context of the statement \\"Annet Artani has co-written lots of songs, including the worldwide hit 'Everytime' with Britney Spears,\\" there is only explicit information about her role in co-writing \\"Everytime.\\" There is no direct evidence in the paragraph to support the notion that she has co-written \\"lots of songs\\" in general.

Article: A new study done by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) shows that it doesn't make much of a difference that parents reward their children with cash for their better marks. Many parents have offered cash to their children in the hope that it would improve marks and possibly raise their children's interest in achieving higher marks. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto (UT) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to learn more about the potential for financial encouragement as motivation for improved marks, involved first and second year students receiving financial aid in 2008-2009 at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The top students participating in the study who said they were \\"very concerned\\" about having enough money to complete their degrees were to receive 100 for getting a grade of 70 per cent for each one-semester course, plus 20 for every percentage point beyond that.It was imaginable that a student could earn as much as 700 for achieving 100 percent in a course. Harvey Weingarten, president and CEO of HEQCO said, \\"In its efforts to help disadvantaged students by exploring the idea of paying them to attend school, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is asking the same question many other districts are asking about how to improve student participation and performance.Our study and others to date indicate that has little effect if any in those situations where it has been tested.\\" The authors of the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a barrier to academic achievement and that the real problem may be more a lack of academic preparation than a lack of effort or motivation.They note that the availability of peer advising does not appear to have helped greatly.They conclude that other potential avenues to improving performance, or other approaches of teaching, are needed at the high school and postsecondary levels. Question: The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of _ . Options: A: academic preparation B: effort or motivation C: teaching methods D: peer advising A:","output":"The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of academic preparation. In the given article, it is mentioned that the study conducted by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) found that offering cash rewards to students for achieving better marks did not significantly improve their performance. The researchers involved in the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a factor impacting academic achievement, and they propose that the real issue might be more related to a lack of academic preparation rather than a lack of effort or motivation. They also note that the availability of peer advising does not seem to have helped much, and emphasize the need for exploring alternative methods to improve performance and teaching approaches at both high school and postsecondary levels. Given this information, the correct answer to the question, \\"The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of _,\\" is option A: academic preparation.

The producer, Oisin Tymon, alleges that both Clarkson and the BBC are guilty of racial discrimination. Background Back in March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson was involved in a physical and verbal altercation with Oisin Tymon, a Top Gear producer, at a hotel in North Yorkshire. According to reports at the time, Clarkson was upset because he could not get a hot meal after a long day of filming and took out his frustrations on Tymon. The argument resulted in Clarkson punching Tymon, leaving him with a split lip and a trip to the hospital. This incident proved to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, as Clarkson's contract with the BBC was not renewed, effectively putting an end to his tenure with the popular motoring show. The Lawsuit In November 2015, Tymon filed a lawsuit against both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC, claiming racial discrimination. At the heart of the lawsuit, Tymon alleges that Clarkson used derogatory and offensive language, specifically targeting his Irish nationality, during the heated altercation. Consequently, Tymon asserts that such comments constitute racial discrimination under the United Kingdom's law. Furthermore, Tymon's legal claim against the BBC revolves around the notion that the broadcasting corporation failed to protect him from racial discrimination. Employers in the United Kingdom are obliged to shield their workers from any form of discrimination and foster a safe and inclusive working environment. Tymon's legal team posits that the BBC did not fulfill this obligation. Impact on Clarkson and the BBC The lawsuit brought forth by Tymon has had significant implications for Jeremy Clarkson. Firstly, it is important that the case brings Clarkson's character into question, especially considering his departure from Top Gear and subsequent move to Amazon's motoring show, The Grand Tour. With a reputation marred by controversy, it remains to be seen if the lawsuit will have further consequences on his career. The BBC, on the other hand, has been heavily criticized for the handling of the whole fiasco. While the corporation did not renew Clarkson's contract, it has been accused of not taking adequate measures to address the issue of discrimination in the workplace. The lawsuit sheds light on a potential systemic issue within the BBC, which has faced other allegations of discrimination in the past. Possible Outcomes Depending on the outcome of the lawsuit, both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC could face significant financial reparations to Tymon if they are found guilty of racial discrimination. Furthermore, the incident could have lasting effects on both parties' reputations and their ability to approach similar situations in the future. It also highlights the importance of addressing racial discrimination in all areas of life, including the entertainment industry. Conclusion The lawsuit filed by the Irish Top Gear producer, Oisin Tymon, against Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination is a stark reminder that such issues should not be taken lightly. Moreover, it presents an opportunity for the entertainment industry and companies, in general, to reassess and strengthen their policies against discrimination in the workplace. The outcome of this case could have considerable consequences for both Clarkson and the BBC and may serve as a precedent for taking racial discrimination seriously within the industry."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: As ad hoc efforts, each individual principle addresses a single aspect that is necessary, but is not sufficient for success by itself.

Now, let's compare the two sentences: Both sentences discuss individual principles being considered alone and how they relate to ensuring success. The first sentence describes these principles as ad hoc efforts, while the second sentence omits this description.

Although he was raised Jewish, Lehrer became an agnostic. He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. Context: Lehrer earned his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1946. He received his MA degree the next year, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He taught classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the National Security Agency(NSA). (Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.) These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., \\"The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be\\" and \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\". Interestingly, it was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere 'fact-of' its existence was classified at the time: this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as as cover story for something more sensitive. Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist Third Class (later retitled \\"Specialist-4\\" and currently \\"Specialist\\"), which he described as being a \\"corporal without portfolio.\\" In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard, but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years. From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled \\"The Nature of Mathematics\\" to liberal arts majors--\\"Math for Tenors\\", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures, primarily those relating to the topic. In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class (on the topic of infinity) and retired from academia. He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still \\"hangs out\\" around the University of California, Santa Cruz. Question: Did Lehrer ever join the military?.

It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber.

One night, Ken indulges Ray's desire to get out of their hotel room, and they explore the city. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray.

Experts predict that various industries will be considerably disrupted due to the automation of tasks that were previously carried out by humans. The manufacturing, transportation, and service sectors have already begun to experience the effects of automation, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. On the other hand, some argue that the adoption of AI and ML technologies has the potential to create new jobs in fields such as AI software development, robotics, and data analysis. There is an on-going debate on whether the advantages of AI and ML adoption will outweigh the potential negative impacts on the job market. Hypothesis: The widespread implementation of AI and Machine Learning technologies will lead to a net increase in job opportunities, as new roles emerge and the demand for skilled workers in AI-related fields grows. This would ultimately offset the displacement of jobs due to automation and result in the overall growth of the job market. Supporting arguments for the hypothesis: 1. Job transformation and upskilling: As AI and ML automation takes over repetitive tasks, human workers will have the opportunity to enhance their skills and transition to higher-value roles. By embracing AI and ML technologies, companies will likely encourage their employees to acquire new skills for more strategic or creative tasks. 2. New job creation: AI and ML will inevitably open up new fields and job opportunities. For instance, AI ethics, AI programming, robotics, and data science are some of the emerging job sectors that have resulted from advancements in AI and ML. As these technologies continue to develop, it is anticipated that even more job roles will be created to support their growth and implementation. 3. Increased productivity: By automating repetitive tasks, AI and ML can increase productivity, which could lead to economic growth. In turn, this growth may create new opportunities and demand for human labor in various industries to support the expansion. 4. Complementing human labor: AI and ML have the potential to work alongside human labor rather than replace it entirely. In many cases, AI and ML technologies can be used to augment human capabilities, empowering people to work more effectively and efficiently. This would create a synergy between human and machine labor that benefits both workers and businesses. However, potential negative impacts should also be considered, such as the ethical implications of job displacement, the need for effective education and upskilling systems, and ensuring that the benefits of AI and ML adoption are equitably distributed across society. In conclusion, although the hypothesis suggests a net increase in job opportunities, continued research, collaboration between industry and academia, and thoughtful policy implementation are necessary to ensure that AI and ML technologies contribute positively to the job market."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Carry out the steps to handle the child until he gets bored or laughs","output":"Carry out the steps to handle the child, until he gets bored or laughs."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"How recognizable was the Upanishadic text to Buddha's people\\" Context: \\"The three marks of existence may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that the these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiair to his hearers.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The Upanishadic texts were an essential part of the spiritual and philosophical fabric of ancient India during the time of the Buddha. They formed the core of the Vedanta, the philosophical culmination of the sacred Vedas, and marked a shift from ritualistic practices towards the pursuit of knowledge, spiritual inquiry, and self-discovery. It is important to understand the recognizability of these texts in order to appreciate the potential influences they had on the Buddha's teachings and his audience's understanding of them. As K.R. Norman suggests, some key concepts in Buddhism such as the three marks of existence (impermanence, suffering, and non-self) may reflect the influences of Upanishadic or other prevailing philosophical ideas of the time. The Upanishads expound on the notions of the ultimate reality (Brahman), the essence of the individual self (Atman), and the unity of these two, all of which had a profound impact on the spiritual landscape of India. Consequently, the Upanishads would have been well-known, at least among scholars, religious practitioners, and the elite, during the Buddha's time. While the exact extent to which the general population was familiar with the Upanishadic texts can be contested, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the teachings and ideas contained within these texts were widely disseminated and discussed within the cultural and religious milieu of ancient India. This allowed for concepts from the Upanishads to be shared, refined, and debated, thus ensuring they would have been recognizable by a larger audience in one form or another. This permeation of ideas and values may have been facilitated by wandering ascetics, Brahmin scholars, students, and religious institutions, who played a critical role in upholding and transmitting the intellectual traditions of their time. In this context, it can be reasonably asserted that the Upanishadic texts, or at least their core teachings and ideas, would have been recognizable to a considerable number of Buddha's contemporaries, in particular those who were involved in spiritual or philosophical discourse. However, it is essential to note that the Buddha's teachings, while they may have been influenced by or shared similarities with Upanishadic ideas, also diverged significantly on crucial aspects like the nature of the self, the ultimate reality, and the path to liberation. The Buddha carved out a distinct path in his approach to these profound questions, placing greater emphasis on empirical observation, personal experience, testable doctrines, and pragmatic ethics. By establishing the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths as the crux of his teachings, the Buddha created a unique set of spiritual principles and practices that resonated with a wide cross-section of society, including those who lacked exposure to the Upanishadic texts. In conclusion, the Upanishadic texts were definitely recognizable to a substantial portion of Buddha's people, particularly scholars, religious practitioners, and the elite. While these texts might have inspired or significantly impacted the formulation of classical Buddhist doctrines like the three marks of existence, it is crucial to keep in mind that the Buddha's teachings were a distinct and groundbreaking departure from these earlier traditions, aimed at addressing the spiritual needs and concerns of his diverse audience."},{"instruction":"it is a statistically risky action you are undertaking. this is especially true if it is a tub you are showering in, because of the huge step over it, you have to take in both directions.

On one side stand those who see clothes dryers as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them.

The first and second numbers are the same. The third number is zero. The fourth number is double the first number. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. What is Brad’s zip code? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Let's analyze the given information and assign variables: 1. The zip code has five numbers, and their sum is 10. Let these numbers be A, B, C, D, and E. So, A + B + C + D + E = 10 2. The first and second numbers are the same. Therefore, A = B. 3. The third number is zero. So, C = 0. 4. The fourth number is double the first number. Thus, D = 2A. 5. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. Hence, D + E = 8. Now, we will use these relationships to find the zip code: Step 1: Substitute the values of B and C in the first equation. A + A + 0 + D + E = 10 2A + D + E = 10 Step 2: Replace D with 2A in step 1. 2A + 2A + E = 10 4A + E = 10 Step 3: Replace D with 2A in the equation D + E = 8. 2A + E = 8 Step 4: Solve for A using the equations in step 2 and step 3: 4A + E = 10 - (2A + E = 8) ---------------- 2A = 2 A = 1 Step 5: Find the value of B.

How would you accomplish this goal? Pick your answer from: 1). Put a few quarts of water in a pot and start the oven underneath it. Add a bit of salt when the water is close to a boil, and add the pasta when the water is boiling.; 2). Put a few quarts of water in a pot and start the oven next to it. Add a bit of flour when the water is close to a boil, and add the pasta when the water is boiling.;","output":"The first option (1) would be the most efficient and accurate method to get the water ready to boil pasta. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Choose an appropriate-sized pot: Select a pot that is large enough to accommodate both the water and the pasta. A pot that is too small can result in water boiling over and potentially create a mess on your stove. A good rule of thumb is to select a pot that can hold at least 4-6 quarts of water. 2. Fill the pot with water: Add a few quarts of water to the pot, ensuring that there is enough water to not only cover the pasta but also to provide room for the pasta to move around once it starts to cook. Too little water could result in the pasta sticking together as it cooks. 3. Start heating the water: Place the pot on the stove and turn on the heat to a high setting, which will expedite the process of bringing the water to a boil. Do not place the pot next to the stove, as mentioned in option 2, as it will not heat the water properly. 4. Add salt to the water: When the water is close to boiling, add a generous amount of salt (about 1-2 tablespoons) to the water. The salt not only enhances the flavor of the pasta but also works to raise the boiling point of the water slightly, allowing for improved cooking conditions. 5. Bring the water to a boil: Continue to heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil with large, continuous bubbles. Adding pasta to water that has not reached a full boil can result in uneven cooking and a less desirable texture. 6. Add the pasta to the boiling water: Once the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta to the pot and give it a gentle stir to prevent it from sticking together or to the bottom of the pot. There is no need to add flour, as stated in option 2, as it is not a conventional ingredient for boiling pasta and may alter the overall taste and texture. 7. Cook the pasta: Cook the pasta as per the package instruction or until it reaches your desired level of doneness, typically around 8-12 minutes, depending on the type and size of the pasta used. Check for al dente (i.e., cooked yet firm when bitten) consistency before draining the pasta. 8. Drain the pasta: Carefully pour the cooked pasta into a colander placed in the sink to drain the water. You may reserve some pasta water for use in any accompanying sauce. By following these steps outlined in option 1, you will be able to get your water ready for boiling pasta and achieve excellent results in terms of taste and texture."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Click here for more Arsenal transfer news.","output":"Title: Arsenal Eyes Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista As Potential Defensive Reinforcement Arsenal F.C., one of England's leading football clubs, is considering a strategic decision to boost their defensive lineup by acquiring Brazilian central defender Gabriel Paulista from the Spanish club, Villarreal C.F. Reports suggest that the club is ready to pay the £15.3 million release clause in Paulista's contract this transfer window, ensuring the stability and strength the team needs for the remainder of the season. The move is contingent on it being in the best interest of all parties involved. Villarreal seems open to negotiations, providing an excellent opportunity for the Gunners to strengthen their defense, which has been heavily reliant on Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in recent times. Gabriel Paulista, a 29-year-old versatile player, has been a pivotal figure in Villarreal's 15-game unbeaten run across all competitions, showcasing top-notch performance and outstanding skills on the field. This run of form has seen the Spanish club rise to the top of their domestic league standings and become a serious contender in European competitions. The transfer of Paulista to the Premier League club would provide significant cover for Arsenal's defensive duo of Koscielny and Mertesacker, filling in any gaps left by the pair's injuries or suspensions. Arsenal's manager recognizes the need for reinforcements, as the team is currently fighting for both domestic and European glory. Despite being in the top four, Arsenal has faced criticism for their frailties at the back, which have sometimes derailed otherwise promising campaigns. By bringing in an accomplished player such as Paulista, the club seeks to address these concerns and create a formidable, well-balanced team capable of challenging for silverware on multiple fronts. The potential transfer of Gabriel Paulista to Arsenal also highlights the fluid nature of the transfer market, where clubs must be adaptable and strategic to remain competitive. By being ready and willing to part with the £15.3 million release clause, Arsenal demonstrates its intentions to be a force to reckon with in European football. The financial power of England's top clubs is often seen as a primary driver for securing talented players from across the globe, and this potential deal is yet another example of that trend. Fans and experts alike eagerly await the culmination of the deal, with supporters hoping that the addition of Paulista will propel Arsenal to new heights - both domestically and on the European stage. With several weeks remaining in the transfer window, the club has ample time to finalize negotiations, ensuring that the possible arrival of the Brazilian defender is a smooth and well-coordinated transition. In conclusion, the proposed transfer of Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal to Arsenal offers an exciting prospect of further bolstering the English club's defensive capabilities. If successful, the deal would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing Paulista to continue his career in one of the world's top leagues and providing Arsenal the necessary reinforcements to mount a strong challenge for titles in the coming months."},{"instruction":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Sir Edwin Lutyens was among the most distinguished architects for war memorials in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse....

Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.).

Options: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 6 (E) 7 Now, let's think a bit. Some random thoughts:","output":"To determine the least number that must be subtracted from 427398 so that the remaining number is divisible by 15, we first need to find the remainder when 427398 is divided by 15. The divisibility rule for 15 states that a number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. The rule for 3 is that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3, and for 5, the last digit must be either 0 or 5. Sum of the digits of 427398: 4 + 2 + 7 + 3 + 9 + 8 = 33, which is divisible by 3. The last digit is 8, which is not divisible by 5. So, we will just focus on making the last digit either 0 or 5. Now, let's calculate the remainder when 427398 is divided by 15: 427398 ÷ 15 = 28493 (remainder 3) Since the remainder is 3, we must subtract 3 to make the number divisible by 15. Therefore, the answer is: (B) 3"},{"instruction":"Context: Despite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland could not join the Nordic Council until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too close to the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the Nordic Council as part of NATO of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members. That same year Finland joined the United Nations, though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations. The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956–1959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959–1965), Max Jakobson (1965–1972), Aarno Karhilo (1972–1977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977–1983), Keijo Korhonen (1983–1988), Klaus Törnudd (1988–1991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991–1998) and Marjatta Rasi (1998–2005). In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for Secretary-General of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the Porkkala peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality. Question: How many years longer did Marjatta Rasi serve as ambassador compared with Klaus Tornudd? Answer:","output":"Marjatta Rasi served as the Finnish ambassador to the United Nations from 1998 to 2005, a period of 7 years. Klaus Törnudd held the position from 1988 to 1991, which is a period of 3 years. Therefore, Marjatta Rasi served for 4 years longer than Klaus Törnudd as the Finnish ambassador to the UN."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Heliciopsis is a genus of about thirteen species of trees constituting part of the flowering plant family Proteaceae.

Sharpshooter Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main theme and genre In order to create a cohesive movie plot, I'll first establish the main theme and genre for the story. Since the keyword is \\"Sharpshooter\\", I'll base the plot around a crime thriller that involves a police chase. Step 2: Introduce the main characters To develop the story, I'll introduce the main characters in the plot. The protagonist will be a skilled sharpshooter who becomes involved in criminal activities. The antagonist will be the police force, particularly a dedicated detective who's determined to bring the sharpshooter to justice. Step 3: Create the setting The story will take place in a large metropolitan city, with a mix of high-end and run-down areas. This creates a more intense atmosphere and reflects the contrast between the protagonist's talent and his criminal actions. Step 4: Develop the protagonist's backstory The sharpshooter, named Jack, is a former military sniper with a dark past. After being discharged from the military due to an injury, Jack struggles to find a job and provide for his family. He quickly realizes that his only marketable skill is his precision with a rifle. Step 5: Introduce the antagonist's motivation Determined and disciplined Detective Sarah Morgan is charged with investigating a series of high-profile assassinations in the city. She gradually begins to suspect that a single sharpshooter is responsible, drawing a connection between the deadly shootings and Jack. Step 6: Build a conflict to engage the audience As Sarah gets closer to the truth, Jack finds himself trapped in the web of his own crimes and the people who hired him. The plot takes a thrilling turn when Sarah starts to close in on Jack, leading to a cat-and-mouse chase through the city's streets. Step 7: Develop subplots and secondary characters Jack's family, unaware of his criminal actions, becomes an emotional anchor for him, while Sarah's dedication to her mission starts to strain her personal relationships. Meanwhile, the crime boss who hired Jack becomes alarmed by Jack's newfound notoriety, heightening the tension as he pressures Jack to complete one final target. Step 8: Create a climax and resolution The climax of the movie occurs when Sarah confronts Jack face-to-face on a rooftop, just as he's about to take out his final target. Jack faces a moral dilemma and chooses to save Sarah from the crime boss's henchmen rather than finishing his assignment. In a thrilling and dramatic rooftop standoff, the police finally manage to kill Jack. Step 9: End with a thought-provoking conclusion The movie ends with Sarah reflecting on the tragedy of Jack's life, his talent being exploited for evil purposes, and the thin line between right and wrong. The audience is left to ponder the complexities of the human condition and the consequences of the choices we make."},{"instruction":"Review: this crazy life Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain.

Options: - sophisticated - imprevist - arcane - heavenly - new Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"Breaking away from a mundane routine can be achieved through various means, such as incorporating new experiences, trying new activities, or adding an element of unpredictability to your daily life. Below is an explanation of each term, but based on their meanings, 'imprevist' seems to be the most relevant option. 1. Sophisticated: This term typically refers to things or people that are cultured, refined, or complex in nature. While incorporating sophisticated activities, interests, or experiences into your routine might add variety and depth, it doesn't necessarily guarantee the removal of a mundane routine. 2. Imprevist: This term is not a standard English word, but it appears to be derived from the Spanish word \\"imprevisto,\\" which translates to \\"unforeseen\\" or \\"unexpected\\" in English. Embracing the unexpected or incorporating spontaneity into your daily routine can indeed help break away from monotony. By adding impromptu events and activities or arranging surprises, you can make your life more exciting and less predictable. 3. Arcane: Arcane refers to secret or hidden knowledge that is not widely known or understood. Though pursuing arcane interests could introduce novelty into one's life, it may not necessarily break the mundane routine unless this pursuit leads to diverse experiences and activities that extend beyond the realm of the ordinary. 4. Heavenly: Heavenly generally pertains to celestial or divine matters, often characterized by extreme beauty or delight. While engaging in heavenly experiences might be pleasurable, it may not directly address the problem of a mundane routine, unless those experiences end up revitalizing your daily life and introducing a sense of novelty. 5. New: Trying new activities, meeting new people, or exploring new places can be an effective way to break a mundane routine. When you actively seek out fresh experiences that challenge your comfort zone, you can create excitement and unpredictability in your life, thus making your routine more varied and engaging. In summary, the term 'imprevist' (or rather its actual meaning derived from the Spanish word \\"imprevisto,\\" possibly referring to the unexpected or unforeseen) seems to be the best option for breaking a mundane routine. By embracing the unexpected, incorporating spontaneity, and seeking out new experiences, you can effectively add variety and excitement to your daily life."},{"instruction":"When she picks 1 / 4 of the number of tomatoes, she goes home with 1 / 4 * 100 = 25 tomatoes.

He will be expecting something positive when he comes to you, and may be very disappointed that you called him for something as unpleasant as a bath. It is preferable to either pick him up and carry him to the bathing spot (if he's small enough), or walk him there. You can pick up your cat, but he may run and hide from you if he knows that you are about to give him a bath. Entice him out of his hiding spot with a treat. Do not be surprised if your pet becomes resistant once he realizes where he is going. If this happens, do not raise your voice. Be gentle yet firm with him, since bathing him will be necessary to remove the urine smell. Once you get to the bathing area, it may be helpful to give your pet a treat or two. If you are bathing your pet in the tub, place a towel in the tub before he gets in. Brushing your pet will remove any tangles or matted fur. Doing this before you bathe him is very important—trying to brush through tangles or mattes is next to impossible when your pet's coat is soaked with water. Start from your pet's neck and slowly work your way down to his tail. If your pet's nails have not been trimmed in a while, your pet could easily use his nails to scratch you while you are bathing him. If you are comfortable with doing so, trim your dog's or cat's nails. If you have to use styptic powder on any of the nails to stop bleeding, wait until the bleeding has stopped before bathing him. Keeping water out of your pet's eyes, ears, and face will be important when you are bathing him. If your pet will let you, place one or two cotton balls in each ear. If he doesn't like having cotton balls in his ears, use extra care to avoid getting water in his ears. Remember to take the cotton balls out of his ears when you have finished bathing him. If you are using a hose or handheld shower head to bathe your pet, make sure that the water pressure is not too forceful. You can also use a large plastic pitcher to pour water over him. If you are giving your pet a bath inside, make sure that the water is no hotter than lukewarm. You may not be able to adjust the temperature of the water if you are bathing your pet outside. To get your pet comfortable with the sensation of getting wet, put the water on his back and shoulders first. Once he has relaxed, wet his neck and work your way back to his tail. Place a generous amount of shampoo in your palm and use your fingers to gently work the shampoo into your pet's coat and skin, starting from his neck and working your way back. By working back from his neck, you will prevent any fleas from moving up his body towards his face and head. You will probably need to shampoo your pet more than once to get the urine smell out. Keep in mind that shampoo has the tendency to strip the skin and coat of natural oils, so you do not want to shampoo him too many times. Use a washcloth dampened with plain water (no shampoo- bold) to wash your pet's face. Talking with your pet in calming voice and offering him occasional treats will help make the bathing process more enjoyable for him. Be careful not to get the shampoo in your pet's eyes. Shampoo residue can make your pet feel itchy, so you want to make sure that you rinse out all of the shampoo before drying him. If you are bathing your dog, be mindful that your his hair is thicker than your own, so you will need to take extra time to work your fingers through his hair when rinsing out the shampoo. You will know when you have rinsed out all of the shampoo when you no longer see any suds in the water that you are using to rinse him. Consider giving your pet a quick sniff after you have finished rinsing him to see if you can smell urine. If you still smell urine, consider shampooing and rinsing him again. If you placed a piece of steel wool in the bathtub drain, remove and discard the steel wool after you have finished rinsing him off. If you are bathing your cat, wrap her snugly in a towel and dry her off in a warm, draft-free location in your home. You may need more than one towel to dry off your dog, depending on his size. If you know that your dog is going to want to shake as soon as you finish rinsing him off, you can try gently holding his muzzle with your thumb and forefinger—a dog cannot shake his body if you hold his muzzle still. You can let go of his muzzle once he is at least somewhat dry. If you are using a blow dryer to dry your pet, set it on one of the cooler settings to prevent thermal damage to his skin. Your dog may be tempted to bolt and rub on something (e.g., furniture, carpet, ground) as soon as you have finished drying him off. Consider keeping him in a relatively confined area, such as the kitchen, until he is completely dry. Reward your pet with a generous amount of positive reinforcement. This can be a combination of treats, new toys, verbal praise, and extra playtime. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Bathing your pet can be a necessary task to remove unpleasant smells, such as urine. To make the experience better for both you and your pet, approach the bathing process gently and calmly. For dogs, walk or carry them to the bathing area, whereas, for cats, entice them out of hiding with a treat. Prepare the bathing area with a towel and ensure the water is lukewarm. Brush your pet before bathing and trim their nails to avoid scratches. Keep their eyes, ears, and face dry and use a gentle water pressure. Apply enough shampoo to remove the urine smell, and rinse thoroughly. Dry your pet well with towels or a blow dryer on a cooler setting and reward them with treats and positive reinforcement after the bath."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Determine the topic of the question.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Later the woman is found dead near the border. Brogan returns to the grandparents to tell them the bad news. Taslima Jahangir, a 15-year-old girl from Bangladesh, presents a paper at school promoting that people should try to understand the 9/11 hijackers. The school principal reports this to authorities. FBI agents raid the home and ransack the girl's room, reading her diaries and a school assignment on the ethics of suicide; they criticize her room as \\"too austere\\" and note that she has an account on an Islamic website. The profiler says this makes her look like a would-be suicide bomber. Taslima is not charged for this, but it turns out that she stays in the United States illegally.

The call came from the BEA, France's air accidents investigation bureau , where the 38-year-old former football player and driver was an investigator. The news was grim. \\"An Airbus is missing over the Atlantic: we need you.\\" As a safety investigator,Ferrante and his teams had participated, directly and indirectly,in the recovery of crashed planes from the Red Sea, the Black Sea,and every ocean. But this investigation would be his toughest ever: the plane had disappeared without a witness, or a trace on radar . At least eight ships and a dozen military aircraft gathered on the plane's last known position, about halfway between Brazil and Western Africa. After six days the aircraft's tail fin and 50 bodies were spotted on the surface and the first burning questions were answered. The plane wreckage and passenger injuries indicated the doomed Airbus was unbroken when it hit the water. It was not exploded apart by a bomb or lightning, now broken up by violent weather. Strangely, no mayday message had been sent by its pilots. Ferrante worked energetically with his team:collecting offers of help from around the world, consulting navy ministries and research organizations in France and elsewhere, and contracting suitable ships and high-tech equipment. He would not return home for another 29 days. His team used the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) operated around the clock, searching about 400 square kilometers a day. But the race against time was lost and no signals were heard and no more wreckage was found. Day after day, the screen remained bare except for objects that turned out to be stones or garbage from ships.

Testimony on Monday painted a picture of pandemonium, where blood-drenched people screamed for help and police officers raced against time to save survivors. While police choked up on the stand recounting the day, the accused sat bushy-bearded at the defense table showing no emotion. Coroners testified that 33 rounds — a mix of single bullets and shotgun blasts — were used to kill the 12 slain victims. Four struck 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. In signs of an anticipated insanity defense, prosecutors and the defense fought to frame Holmes' state of mind during and immediately after the July 20 shooting, pitting images of a determined shooter against someone disconnected from his surroundings. Surveillance video from the lobby of the Century Aurora 16 theater shows Holmes hiding his dyed-red hair beneath a dark stocking cap. He had purchased his ticket for the midnight showing July 8. Police recovered 209 live AR-15 rounds and 15 live 40-caliber handgun rounds from the scene, testified Detective Matthew Ingui. The gunman was \\"very calm and moving with purpose,\\" one victim told Ingui. Officers from all points rushed to the scene, at first mistaking the man in the gas mask and body armor for one of their own. From atop an elevated garage, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard scouted the back of the theater, where he spotted Holmes. \\"My first thought was, 'How did that SWAT guy get here so quick?' \\" Jonsgaard testified. For a few brief moments, he held Holmes in his cross hairs. At the same time, Officer Jason Oviatt realized he had made a similar mistake. Holmes was \\"just standing there,\\" Oviatt testified. \\"Not doing anything. Not in any hurry. Not excited.\\" Oviatt and the other officers paint a nuanced picture of his state of mind — details attorneys homed in on. At one point, defense attorney Daniel King pointed out that Oviatt had observed Holmes dripping with sweat. Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Pearson quickly pointed out that anyone wearing body armor would likely be sweating. Oviatt's reports from that day note Holmes \\"simply stared off into the distance\\" and \\"seemed to be out of it and disoriented.\\" On the stand, Oviatt said Holmes was \\"very, very relaxed\\" and showed no normal emotional responses but understood directions and cooperated.

(Associated Press) Family members and victims line up to get into court for a preliminary hearing for Aurora theater shooting suspect james Holmes at the courthouse in Centennial, Colo., on Monday, Jan. 7, 2013. Holmes... (Associated Press) One sergeant recalled during the hearing for suspected gunman James Holmes that he checked and did not find a pulse for the youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. Another who drove the wounded to the hospital said he had to stop one man worried about his 7-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car. A bearded Holmes didn't appear to show any emotion. One woman sat with her head buried in her hands during the testimony about Veronica. The police officer who arrested the suspected gunman said he first thought James Holmes was a fellow officer because he was wearing body armor. Then the officer realized he was wrong because Holmes wasn't running toward the scene. The first extensive details were emerging about the young man suspected of killing 12 people and wounding at least 58 in one of the worst mass shootings in the U.S. last year. The hearing will determine whether the case will go to trial. Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. Investigators say he was wearing a gas mask, in addition to the body armor, when he tossed two gas canisters and opened fire in the theater on July 20. As soon as Officer Jason Oviatt saw Holmes outside the theater and realized that he wasn't a fellow officer, he pointed his gun at Holmes, handcuffed him and searched him. Oviatt said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car. The officer said an ammunition round fell out of Holmes' pocket, and he found another one on the ground. Police officers who arrested Holmes described him as unusually relaxed but fidgety at times. They said he told them that his apartment had been booby trapped. Holmes didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things, Oviatt said. \\"He seemed very detached from it all,\\" he said. Until now, many details of the case have been kept quiet. Three days after the shooting, District Judge William Sylvester forbade attorneys and investigators from discussing the case publicly, and many court documents have been filed under seal. Police say Holmes, now 25, had stockpiled weapons, ammunition and explosives. He was a first-year student in a Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado, Denver, but he failed a year-end exam and withdrew, authorities have said. The shootings came six weeks later. Federal authorities have said Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and is believed to have propped open a door, slipped out to his car and returned with his weapons. Police arrested him outside the theater shortly after the shootings ended. Legal analysts said that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may accept a plea agreement before trial. In general, plea agreements help prosecutors avoid costly trials, give the accused a lesser sentence like life in prison rather than the death penalty and spare the victims and their families from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial. Holmes' mental health could be a significant issue in the hearing. His attorneys have told the judge Holmes is mentally ill, but they have not said whether they plan to employ an insanity defense. He had seen a university psychiatrist, and his lawyers have said he tried to call the psychiatrist nine minutes before the killing began. Defense lawyers have said they plan to call at least two witnesses who could testify about Holmes' mental health. Prosecutors asked the judge to block the witnesses, but he refused. Lawyers have been debating what physical evidence should be made available, whether a psychiatrist who met with Holmes is barred from testimony by doctor-patient privilege and other issues. ___ Associated Press writer Dan Elliott contributed. |||||","output":"During the preliminary hearing in Centennial, Colorado, the prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, described the locations where police recovered bodies, and detailed how each of the 12 slain victims died during the theater-shooting incident involving James Holmes.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

In most cases, these strategies were tested, researched, and judged as the best way to teach a certain sex education program. Some curriculums will be very specific, providing you with detailed lesson plans, activities, and strategies. Many educators will work with their school, community, or sexual health organization to figure out what the best approaches and strategies to teaching sex education are. If there are particular strategies or approaches that you believe are effective, you can always find a way to become involved with how sex education is taught to others. Join organizations, your school board, or speak to officials about ways to better sex education in your area. Most sexual health organizations encourage educators to adopt cooperative learning strategies. This means students or learners work with others in assignments, discussions, and projects. This gets students involved in their learning and helps them construct meaning from information on their own. Some examples of cooperative learning strategies include: Inquiry-based learning: This approach places students' questions, ideas, and observations in the centre of their learning experience. You will act as a \\"provocateur\\" or someone that introduces students to ideas or topics that is of interest to them or what matters to them. Students are guided to investigate and look for answers using critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based reasoning. Problem-based learning: This approach begins by presenting a problem to students before they receive any knowledge about a topic. This method gives you more control of what topics or problems to focus on. After students are informed of the problem, they are encouraged to seek knowledge and solutions cooperatively together. For example, you could make up a hypothetical problem like \\"Sally doesn't want to have sex with her boyfriend. How can she tell her boyfriend this?\\" and then ask students to come up with a solution. Project-based learning: This approach has students working on a long term project that addresses and investigates complex questions, problems, or challenges in sex education. A popular project-based learning approach used in sex education is to simulate what having a baby is like. Students bring home a lifelike baby doll that cries, eats, poops, and pees, and are asked to care for it for an extended period of time. The project helps students realize that caring for a child can be difficult and teaches them responsibility. If you have had a baby, try caring for the doll yourself, and then tell them how it compares to caring for a real baby. (Is it easier? Harder?) You can use pictures, diagrams, videos, or visual demonstrations to keep students engaged while you're teaching. Try these activities: Fill in the blank diagrams. This is especially helpful to demonstrate the human body and things related to it such as the menstrual cycle, genitalia, areas affected by puberty, or the reproduction cycle. Watch informative videos. In most sex education curriculums, videos will be provided to help you teach your students. Demonstrate how to do things. In many sex education courses, educators will demonstrate with objects how to put on a condom, how to use a menstrual pad or tampon, how contraceptives work, and how sexually transmitted diseases work. It's important these demonstrations only simulate the actual action. You may have seen educators put condoms on bananas or use small cups of water to demonstrate how a tampon works. Journal-writing encourages students to record, reflect, and write about their health learning. Many health care providers encourage people of all ages and life stages to use journal writing to keep track of their health concerns. Having a health care journal can: Keep track of your health. It's easier to detect patterns if you record any concerns you have about your health the moment it happens. A constant ache or pain could indicate a bigger problem if it has been happening for days or weeks. An injury in the past might explain a new health concern today. Keep track of medications. A journal could help remind you to take medication, get tested regularly, or inform them of what medications they have used in the past. Provide an overall review of a person's health. Just by recording all things health-related, a health care journal can give a brief summary of your health. After teaching your students, it's important to evaluate how effective your teaching was. There are many ways you can assess your students: Do a comprehension check. You can simply ask students to reiterate what they learned after a lesson. Or give them a quiz or do a review exercise. Observe your students. You may notice a few disengaged students, or you may realize a certain topic makes everyone feel uncomfortable. By observing your students, you can assess how effective your lesson was. Assess projects and assignments according to a rubric. This is a more accurate way to measure the success of your lesson. Many curriculums provided by your school or a health care organization will have rubrics to help you assess students' learning. Summary:","output":"This article talks about different ways to teach a special subject called \\"sex education.\\" Teachers can use different activities and strategies to help students understand and learn about it. Some ways include working together on projects, asking questions, and solving problems. They can also use pictures, videos, and show students how to do things using objects like bananas and small cups of water. One more idea is to have students keep a journal about their health. After teaching, teachers can check how well their students learned by asking questions, watching them, and using a special tool called a rubric."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: it is not possible to tell","output":"Question: Can you accurately predict the exact weather conditions (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) for a specific location 30 days from now? Reasoning: The answer, \\"it is not possible to tell,\\" is justified because weather predictions rely on complex meteorological models and data that constantly change based on numerous variables. While weather forecasting has become increasingly accurate in recent years, forecasts are still not precise beyond a certain range (usually up to 10 days). The inherent uncertainty and chaotic nature of weather systems make it impossible to predict exact conditions 30 days in advance."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: It was Christmas, and there was a big party in the house.

In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal (George Dzundza), gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank, to serve as execution for disabling and killing a Russian tank crew. As the new khan, following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the opportunistic scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank's crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people's code of honour: milmastia (hospitality), badal (revenge), and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal (called \\"Tank Boy\\" during World War II for destroying a number of German tanks when he was a child soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad) demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple of attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen.

Since late June, the 30-year fixed rate hasn’t been above 4.14 percent or below 4.1 percent. The 15-year fixed-rate average edged down to 3.24 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.25 percent a week ago and 3.59 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed rate has drifted between 3.27 percent and 3.22 percent since late June. Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages also were flat.

It's a Christmas gift so I don't have time to return the item. It was not what I ordered nor what my confirmation e mail showed. Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product they received from Amazon. The primary reason for their disappointment stems from the fact that the product they received was not the same pattern or style they originally ordered or wanted, as indicated by their confirmation email. The negative sentiment in this review is further emphasized by the reviewer's mention of their past positive experiences with Amazon, stating that they have done a lot of shopping with the platform without encountering any problems until this particular product. Consequently, the mismatch between their expectations and the actual product received has left the reviewer feeling upset and disappointed. Moreover, the situation is compounded by the fact that the product is meant to be a Christmas gift, and the reviewer does not have sufficient time to return it and obtain a replacement. This external time constraint adds an additional layer of disappointment, as the reviewer is now faced with the prospect of not being able to provide the intended gift for Christmas.

Craig wasn't good with handling rejection but Justin handled it well.","output":"Craig wasn't good with handling rejection as it always left him feeling vulnerable, insecure, and overwhelmed. His heart would race and his mind would swirl with a barrage of negative thoughts, making it difficult for him to process the rejection. He would often ruminate on the experience for days or even weeks, questioning his worth and replaying the incident in his head. This made him highly sensitive and, at times, even afraid to put himself out there, whether it was in relationships or any other aspect of his life. On the other hand, Justin handled rejection well, demonstrating remarkable emotional resilience and an admirable capacity to bounce back from disappointments. He understood that not every situation or interaction would yield the desired outcome and that rejections were a natural part of life. Rather than allowing himself to be consumed by negative emotions and self-doubt, Justin would take a step back and objectively assess the situation. He would then use the experience as a learning opportunity, identifying areas where he could improve and developing strategies for better handling similar situations in the future. Furthermore, Justin was skilled at maintaining a healthy self-esteem and a sense of self-worth that was not entirely dependent on external validation. He recognized that his worth was not defined by a single rejection. That understanding enabled him to maintain an optimistic outlook and continue pursuing his goals and interests with enthusiasm and determination. In short, Justin's ability to embrace the inevitability of rejection, learn from it, and maintain a positive sense of self made him highly adaptable and emotionally strong, attributes that undoubtedly contributed to his overall success and happiness."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Law professor, writer and political activist Lawrence Lessig, along with many other copyleft and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original.

Input: Passage: Success in marriage has been associated with higher education and higher age. 81% of college graduates, over 26 years of age, who wed in the 1980s, were still married 20 years later. 65% of college graduates under 26, who married in the 1980s, were still married 20 years later. 49% of high school graduates under 26 years old, who married in the 1980s, were still married 20 years later. 2.9% of adults age 35–39 without a college degree divorced in the year 2009, compared with 1.6% with a college education. A population study found that in 2004 and 2008, liberal-voting states have lower rates of divorce than conservative-voting states, possibly because people in liberal states tend to wait longer before getting married. An analysis of this study found it to be misleading due to sampling at an aggregate level.

Article: Would you eat a ready meal from the fridge rather than cook by yourself? Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the Morning Post newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges. In 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food. In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists - in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots. In 1933 he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford.","output":"This text is about William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, a British economist, progressive, and social reformer.

John tries to determine when Biederman will be presiding over his next case, only to discover that Biederman died three days before John's release.

At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John breaks into Nelson's BMW, wrecks the interior of it and empties Nelson's emergency inhaler. After the ceremony, Nelson drives off and, finding his inhaler empty, panics and hyperventilates. He stops at a pharmacy and frantically searches through the shelves, desperately seeking a replacement for the empty inhaler, which he finds and immediately opens to use. The pharmacy owners think he's a junkie seeking a fix. One owner mistakes the inhaler for a tiny pistol and calls the police. Nelson is arrested and charged with assault and armed robbery.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lever would produce smaller increase in force, lever A or lever B?","output":"Based on the information provided, lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning it has no friction to overcome. On the other hand, lever B is a real-world lever that does have to overcome some friction. Therefore, lever A would produce a larger increase in force since it does not have to deal with friction.

Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as \\"Fingerling\\". Walter begins to have dreams of murdering Agatha. Walter tries to warn her about the number being dangerous and how it was going to come after her. She tells him he is crazy. Walter comes to realize that he is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering a woman named Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra). He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch (Mark Pellegrino) was convicted and imprisoned instead. Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to a hotel. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and tries to assure him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer, accepting the fact that he murdered Tollins, and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. Agatha pushes a letter opener into Walter's hand, saying that, if he is indeed a killer, he can easily kill again and dares him to kill her. She tells him that she loves him. Walter tells her that she can't love him because no one can, mirroring an accusation made by Laura on the night of her murder.

Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Sink the Bismarck! Movie plot: In 1939, Nazi Germany's largest and most powerful battleship, Bismarck, is launched in a ceremony at Hamburg with Adolf Hitler attending. The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness. Next morning near Iceland Bismarck and Prinz Eugen encounter HMSÂ Hood and HMS Prince of Wales. The four warships engage in a heavy battle. During the battle a shell from Bismarck hits the Hood slightly... My question: What type of torpedos inflicted damage to Bismark? Answer:","output":"During the pursuit of the Bismarck, it was British aircraft that inflicted significant damage rather than torpedoes specifically. On May 26, 1941, aircraft from the British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal launched an attack on the Bismarck using 18 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. These aircraft were armed with the British Mark XII aerial torpedoes. In the course of the attack, one of the torpedoes managed to hit the Bismarck's stern, jamming its rudder and leaving the ship unable to make significant maneuvers. This damage allowed the British surface fleet to catch up to the Bismarck, which led to its eventual sinking on May 27, 1941, following a sustained bombardment from several Royal Navy warships. So, while the Bismarck was critically damaged by a single aerial torpedo from the British Mark XII, it was the combination of air and surface attacks that ultimately led to its demise."},{"instruction":"Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer who came to international attention when she appeared as a contestant on the TV programme Britain's Got Talent on 11 April 2009, singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables. Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. Boyle took singing lessons from vocal coach Fred O'Neil. She attended Edinburgh Acting School and took part in the Edinburgh Fringe. She also long participated in her parish church's pilgrimages to the Knock Shrine, County Mayo, Ireland, and sang there at the Marian basilica.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. and the situation: Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Answer the following question: Which country caused less acid rain? The answer is:","output":"Greece caused less acid rain because it relied on nuclear power to produce its electricity. Acid rain is primarily a result of the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These emissions mainly come from burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. When SO2 and NOx react with other substances in the atmosphere, they form acidic compounds that fall to the ground as precipitation, causing acid rain. In the given situation, Turkey primarily used fossil fuels to produce electricity. This means that their power generation process released significant amounts of SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere, contributing to acid rain formation. In contrast, Greece relied on nuclear power, which produces electricity without emitting SO2 and NOx, leading to a drastically lower contribution to acid rain. Though nuclear power is not without its drawbacks, such as the generation of radioactive waste and the risk of nuclear accidents, it does provide an advantage in terms of reduced air pollution and acid rain when compared to fossil fuel-based electricity production. Therefore, Greece, with its reliance on nuclear energy, is the country that caused less acid rain in this scenario."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Alfredo Zitarrosa, birthPlace, Uruguay; Alfredo Zitarrosa, genre, Candombe; Alfredo Zitarrosa, recordLabel, Odeon Records; Alfredo Zitarrosa, background, \\"solo singer\\".

Upon completion, these once abandoned homes will serve as a stable place to live for these formerly homeless individuals, helping them rebuild their lives and regain their independence. The Growing Problem of Youth Homelessness: In recent years, youth homelessness has become a pressing concern in many parts of the world including the United Kingdom. According to a 2020 study by Centrepoint, it was estimated that 121,000 young people were facing homelessness or were at risk of ending up on the streets. These staggering numbers highlight the urgent need for innovative and effective solutions to combat this growing crisis. The Pilot Scheme: The pilot scheme aims to create a win-win solution for both the young homeless people and the local councils, which are grappling with a large number of derelict properties across the UK. This program offers young homeless individuals the opportunity to learn crucial life and trade skills while converting vacant council-owned properties into livable, functional homes. Participants in the program will be trained and guided by professionals in trades like carpentry, plumbing, and electrical work. Not only will this allow them to renovate and refurbish the council houses, but it will also provide them with invaluable vocational training that could be the key to securing a stable job in the future. Potential Benefits: 1. Improved Housing Infrastructure: One of the major benefits of the pilot program is the significant upgrade in housing infrastructure that will come with it. By renovating and restoring derelict council houses, this initiative aims to turn underutilized properties into habitable spaces that contribute to solving the housing crisis within the communities. 2. Empowering Participants with Valuable Skills: Acquiring trade skills during the renovation process is an essential element of the program. This training will empower the young homeless participants by equipping them with highly-valued skills that open up job opportunities and the possibility of long-term employment, which in turn can lead to a greater sense of self-sufficiency and financial stability. 3. Reduced Reliance on Government Support: By providing training and stable housing to formerly homeless individuals, the scheme could potentially reduce their dependence on government assistance programs. This not only benefits the participants but also frees up valuable resources that can be reallocated to other social services. 4. Community Rehabilitation: The positive effects of the pilot program extend beyond the individual participants. As more derelict council houses are renovated and occupied, this can lead to the revitalization of affected neighborhoods, making them safer and more attractive in the long run. Challenges and Considerations: As with any new initiative, the pilot program may encounter challenges along the way. It will be essential for local councils and organizers to acknowledge and address any concerns that arise, ensuring that the program is optimized for success. In order to guarantee the sustainability of the program, it is crucial to secure adequate funding for training, tools, and other essential resources needed for the renovations. Additionally, ongoing support and mentorship must be provided to the participants to ensure they are successfully integrating into their newly acquired trade and their new lives, with possibilities to refine or expand the program based on the lessons learned during the pilot. Conclusion: The innovative pilot program, which offers young homeless individuals the chance to renovate derelict council houses, has the potential to positively transform the lives of countless individuals struggling with homelessness. By addressing the complex issue through vocational training and housing solutions, this initiative may serve as a blueprint for other communities around the world seeking to alleviate youth homelessness in a compassionate and empowering manner. As one home is restored, so too is the hope for a brighter future for all involved in the program."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Robin Weaver is an English actress well known for playing the role of recurring character Pamela Cooper in the E4 sitcom \\"The Inbetweeners\\" and its feature-length films, \\"The Inbetweeners Movie\\" and \\"The Inbetweeners 2\\".

In this sentence, \\"The children\\" and \\"Synøve\\" are capitalized. \\"The children\\" is capitalized because it is the first phrase of the sentence. In the English language, regardless of the length of the sentence or what it communicates, the initial word is always capitalized. This rule helps identify where one sentence ends and another begins, ensuring clarity and understanding when reading. \\"Synøve\\" is also capitalized, but for a different reason. \\"Synøve\\" is a proper noun, as it is a name given to an individual, in this case, a particular woman involved in the event. All proper nouns, including people's names and place names, must always be capitalized in the English language. All the other words in this sentence are correctly in lower-case letters.

What historic home is located at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot? Answer:","output":"The historic home located at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot is the Chambers House. The Depot, now known as Letterkenny Army Depot, is situated in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, USA. The Chambers House, a part of the Letterkenny Army Depot, holds a great historical significance and serves as a crucial link to the rich past of the region. The Chambers House, a remarkable Georgian-style farmhouse, was constructed in the 1760s by Captain Benjamin Chambers, who was an early settler in the region. Benjamin Chambers, along with his brothers, played a crucial role in the founding and development of the town of Chambersburg. The property on which the Chambers House is built was the location of both industrial (grist and saw mills) and agricultural operations for Chambers and his family. The Chambers House and its surrounding land were eventually put to patriotic use. During the early stages of the American Revolution, the house served as a supply depot and encampment site for troops. Fast forward to World War II, and to support the war efforts, the United States government established the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot in 1942, in the same location. The Depot's purpose was to function as a maintenance facility and storage site for ammunition, equipment, and other military goods. Following World War II, the facility was downsized but continued to play an important role during the Korean War, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and other military operations. In 1954, the Depot was officially renamed Letterkenny Army Depot, and it remains an active military installation under the jurisdiction of the United States Army. The Chambers House, due to its historical and architectural importance, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The house serves as a tangible reminder of the region's early history, including the Chambers family's involvement in the area's early development and the military importance historically associated with the site. In conclusion, the historic home at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot is the Chambers House. This historic landmark, built by Captain Benjamin Chambers, has played a significant role as a supply depot during the American Revolution, and the Depot site has continued to serve the military needs of the United States Army over the years. The Chambers House holds a strong connection to the past, providing a direct link between the region's early history and its continued role in national defense."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: HewasinterestedinhearingabouthowtheexperiencesfromtheRenewableEnergyIslandconcerninglocalcitizeninvolvementandlocalownershipcanbeusedwhenlookingatthedistributionofelectriccars.Ourpresentproject“Samsø–aModelSocietyfortheDistributionofElectricCars”isfinancedbytheDanishEnergyAgency.","output":"He was interested in hearing about how the experiences from the Renewable Energy Island concerning local citizen involvement and local ownership can be used when looking at the distribution of electric cars.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Research on the breed history and development of Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore scenthounds. Step 2: Identify if both breeds have Foxhounds in their lineage. Based on my research, the Porcelaine dog breed originated in France and is believed to have ancestry from the English Harrier, which is closely related to the Foxhound. However, it is not a direct crossbreed with the Foxhound. The breed was developed using other scent hounds like the Montaimboeuf and the Chien de Franche-Comté. The Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore is also a French scenthound breed, and its lineage includes the English Foxhound, along with the Gascon Saintongeois and the Poitevin breeds. The Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore was developed as a result of breeding these dogs together to create a powerful hunting dog. Answer: The Porcelaine is not a direct crossbreed with the Foxhound, but it does share a close ancestry through the English Harrier. On the other hand, the Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore is a crossbreed with the Foxhound, as it was one of the breeds used in its development.

Se oli yksi ensimmäisistä graafisista www-selaimista, ja sitä kehitti Pei-Yuan Wei Kalifornian yliopistossa Berkeleyssä. ViolaWWW oli alun perin suunniteltu perustumaan Wei'n aikaisemmin kehittämään Viola-ohjelmointikieleen, joka oli tarkoitettu graafisten käyttöliittymien parissa työskentelyyn. Lopulta ViolaWWW päätyi käyttämään HyperText Markup Language (HTML) -kieltä, joka oli silloin uusi ja alussa oleva teknologia, jonka Tim Berners-Lee oli luonut CERNissä. ViolaWWW tarjosi monia graafisen käyttöliittymän etuja verrattuna aikaisempiin tekstipohjaisiin www-selaimiin, kuten mahdollisuus lisätä kuvia, käyttää erilaisia fontteja ja muotoiluja sekä tehdä hyperlinkeistä helpommin tunnistettavia ja käytettäviä. Sen avulla käyttäjät pystyivät selata Internetin varhaisia verkkosivustoja, jotka olivat yksinkertaisempia ja vähemmän monimutkaisia kuin nykypäivän sivustot, mutta silti tarjosivat ainutlaatuisia tietolähteitä ja kommunikaatiovälineitä. Vaikka ViolaWWW oli aluksi varsin suosittu ja laajalti käytetty, se joutui pian kilpailuun muiden nopeasti kehittyvien www-selaimien kanssa. Esimerkiksi Marc Andreessen ja hänen tiiminsä kehittämä Mosaic-selain, joka julkaistiin vuonna 1993, osoittautui erityisen suosituksi, ja se mullisti tapaa, jolla ihmiset käyttivät Internetiä.

Solve 34*q = 3*q + 62 for q.","output":"To solve the equation 34*q = 3*q + 62 for q, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Isolate the variable (q) on one side of the equation. To do this subtract 3*q from both sides to get rid of q on the right side of the equation: 34*q - 3*q = 3*q - 3*q + 62 Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. Combine the terms with the variable q on the left side of the equation: (34 - 3)*q = 62 31*q = 62 Step 3: Solve for q by dividing both sides of the equation by 31. 31*q / 31 = 62 / 31 q = 2 So the solution to the equation is q = 2."},{"instruction":"Title: Nice Review: Love it.

Here's an example of a movie review for a fictional movie titled \\"Destiny's Edge\\": --- Title: **Destiny's Edge: An Adventure Worth Taking** Destiny's Edge, directed by John Smith, is an adrenaline-pumping adventure film that takes viewers on an unforgettable journey through the treacherous terrain of the Amazon rainforest. With breathtaking cinematography and a talented ensemble cast, this movie is an absolute must-see. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the movie components. **Plot Summary** The film follows the story of archeologist Dr. Sarah Olson (played by Jane Doe), who embarks on a quest to uncover a lost city deep within the Amazon rainforest after discovering a centuries-old map. Along the way, Dr. Olson and her intrepid team face numerous challenges and uncover secrets that will forever change their understanding of the world. **Acting** Jane Doe delivers a strong performance as Dr. Sarah Olson, expertly capturing the character's unyielding determination to uncover the truth. The ensemble cast, including John Citizen and Jane Smith, creates an entertaining dynamic that strengthens viewers' investment in the story. The chemistry between the actors makes for an engaging experience as they overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles as a team. **Direction and Cinematography** John Smith's direction is both exhilarating and visually striking. The expertly choreographed action sequences are thrilling to watch without overshadowing the emotional depth of the characters. Smith also utilizes the stunning natural backdrop of the Amazon rainforest to our delight, making it a breathtaking canvas for the film's captivating story. **Film Score and Sound Design** The film score by Tom Johnson is truly impressive, adding additional depth and atmosphere to the overall viewing experience. The music complements the film's fast-paced action without feeling intrusive. Additionally, the sound design effectively immerses the viewer in the dangerous world of the Amazon rainforest—from the rustle of leaves to the roar of a waterfall. **Overall Recommendation** Destiny's Edge is an epic adventure full of suspense and drama. With its beautifully-crafted set pieces, skilled direction, and engaging performances, it's certainly worth the price of admission. I believe audiences who enjoy action-packed stories with heart will be thoroughly entertained. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars. ---"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Good but not indestructible Review: Medium is good enough for my 38 lbs mix.

It exhibited maximum sustained winds of up to 185 mph and continued for a record-breaking 37 hours. Irma's destructive path in the U.S. can be traced to several key regions that were severely impacted by the hurricane. Florida: The state of Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Irma within the United States. The cyclone made its initial landfall on September 10, 2017, as a Category 4 storm in the Florida Keys at Cudjoe Key. The hurricane then moved towards the northwest and made a second landfall on Marco Island, which lies west of the Florida Peninsula. The hurricane proceeded to move northwards, leading to widespread damage throughout the state. Irma's impact was felt across Florida, affecting major cities like Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Orlando, and the surrounding areas. Streets, homes, and businesses were flooded; utility infrastructures were damaged, rendering millions without power, and the storm caused incredible damage to agriculture, marinas, and the natural environment. Georgia: Hurricane Irma impacted the neighboring state of Georgia as well, mostly as a tropical storm after being downgraded from a hurricane. As it moved northwards, Irma's strong winds and rain lashed the state, leading to coastal flooding, property damage, and power outages. The areas impacted in Georgia included the coastal cities of Savannah and Brunswick, as well as the regions of Atlanta and South Georgia. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power, and there were reports of downed trees, damaged homes, and localized flooding. South Carolina: Moving further north, Hurricane Irma's impact was also felt in South Carolina. While not as severe as in Florida or Georgia, coastal areas and the state's Lowcountry region experienced storm surge-induced flooding, and strong winds led to downed trees, property damage, and power outages. Charleston was notably affected, with knee-high flooding reported in some parts of the city. U.S. Territories in the Caribbean: Before reaching the U.S. mainland, Hurricane Irma had already left a trail of destruction in U.S. territories in the Caribbean. The U.S. Virgin Islands, particularly St. Thomas and St. John, were heavily impacted, experiencing widespread devastation to infrastructure and homes. In Puerto Rico, while the eye of the hurricane did not directly pass over the island, it experienced significant rainfall, flooding, and wind damage. As a result, many structures were damaged, and hundreds of thousands of residents were left without power. In conclusion, Hurricane Irma left a massive trail of destruction across the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean territories. Along its path, millions of lives were disrupted, and the financial, social, and environmental toll from the storm was immense. It will be remembered as one of the most powerful and damaging storms in U.S. history."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Hi, boys and girls!

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Earthquakes are complex natural phenomena that occur due to the movement of tectonic plates and the release of energy from the Earth's crust. Many scientists have been studying earthquakes for decades, trying to understand their patterns, behaviors, and causes. Although we've made significant strides in understanding the mechanics of earthquakes, the exact timing of when they'll happen remains difficult to predict. There are a variety of factors that influence the occurrence of earthquakes, such as plate movement, geological stress, and even the Earth's rotation. Predicting earthquakes is also complicated by the fact that each earthquake is unique, and they do not always follow the same patterns. While we can estimate the likelihood of an earthquake occurring within a given time frame or in a specific region, we are unable to pinpoint an exact date and time. Additionally, even with advances in technology and seismology, the unpredictable nature of earthquakes means there are still many unknowns in our quest to predict them accurately. As a result, it is not possible to tell the exact date and time of the next major earthquake in California."},{"instruction":"How is \\"It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the sentence \\"It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action.\\" is translated to: \\"Se pidättäytyy kuitenkin arvostelemasta Yhdysvaltojen aggressiivista yksipuolisuutta, joka avaa oven väkivallalle ja mielivaltaisille toimille.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"It refrains, though, from criticising\\" = \\"Se pidättäytyy kuitenkin arvostelemasta\\" - \\"the aggressive unilateralism of the US\\" = \\"Yhdysvaltojen aggressiivista yksipuolisuutta\\" - \\"which opens the door to\\" = \\"joka avaa oven\\" - \\"violence and arbitrary action\\" = \\"väkivallalle ja mielivaltaisille toimille\\" The Finnish language has a different grammatical structure and word order compared to English, so the translation might seem slightly different while conveying the same meaning.

Director Nadia Latif and playwright Omar El-Khairy said earlier this month that they were given no prior warning about the cancellation of the play, which was inspired by three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State.

For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com. Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing. New Yorkers took pity on the subway Romeo and joined his hunt. The mysterious girl was named as Camille Hayton, from Melbourne, Australia, who was working at the magazine Black Book and also lived in Brooklyn. One of her friends saw the sketched picture on the Web site and recognized her. But after finding each other, appearing on TV and getting international press, the couple took their romance out of the public eye, with Moberg closing down the Web site and with both refusing to make any more comments--until now. Hayton told Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph that she dated Moberg for about two months but it just didn't work out. \\"I say we dated for a while but now we're just friends,\\" Hayton, now 23, told the newspaper. Hayton said she is still recognized about three times a week on the streets of Manhattan as \\"that girl\\" and the question is always the same: \\"So what happened?\\" \\"I think the situation was so intense that it linked us,\\" she said, adding, \\"it linked us in a way that you could mistake, I guess, for being more romantic than it was. I don't know. But I wanted to give it a go so didn't wonder what if, what if?\\" Hayton told The Sunday Telegraph that she is enjoying single life in New York, keeping busy with acting classes, working in two clothing stores. Last week she had a small role as a waitress in the long-running daytime soap As the World Turns. \\"I just can't believe it happened. It feels like a long time ago,\\" said Hayton. Moberg, however, was still refusing to comment on the relationship. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What is Patrick's profession? 2. How did the relationship end? 3. How long did they date before breaking up? 4. What soap opera did Camille get a role on? 5. Do people still recognize her? 6. What do they want to know? 7.

I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews. The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. As Diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (\\"Rocky\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie \\"Girlfight.\\" The reviewer recommends the movie, praises its gritty, non-Hollywood style, and appreciates the performances and storyline. They also mention that the movie might have brought the boxing genre to its apex, which indicates a high regard for the film.

The passengers and crew are placed in hypersleep, with a rotating crew who awake for shifts of two years each maintaining the ship throughout the journey. Eight years into the mission the ship receives a transmission from Earth in multiple languages: \\"You're all that's left of us.

Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial amnesia. The ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, which leaves them unable to enter the bridge, although they have steady power in their quarters. Bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor in case it goes critical.

Title: great trike! Review: After much searching, we finally found a nice trike for our 2 year old. This bike is sturdily built, relatively easy to assmeble (took my mechanically-inclined husband about 30 minutes to assemble), and has lots of great features.It does appear to be for smaller children. Our son just turned 2, is the size of a 3 year old, and this bike will likely only fit him for 1 year. I wouldn't buy this for an older child (like a 4 year old) unless they are small.The frame adjusts to 4 different sizes, as does the seat. The handle telescopes to 3 different lengths. The push bar isn't quite tall enough to suit us, but we are tall people & for a stroll around the neighborhood, it's comfortable enough.You can lock the steering and the rear wheels (nice for walking the long straight-aways) or you can unlock the rear wheels and the adult controls the steering.This little bike is cute, well built, (it's a Kettler!) and quite reasonable in price. We recommend it highly.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Why did IMB hire so many designers?

Options: - make music - inspiration - musical sounds - making music - dancing Explain why a human would choose \\"inspiration\\" to answer the question above:","output":"Inspiration is a crucial element not only in playing piano but in any creative activities. The option \\"inspiration\\" could be selected as the answer for numerous reasons. Firstly, it's important to understand that playing the piano goes beyond just the physical aspect of hitting the right keys and creating sounds or music. It necessitates the capacity for creative expression, which can only come from a source—this source is often referred to as inspiration. Inspiration aids in the process of interpreting the emotion and intention behind the pieces, and influences how the pianist makes the piece their own instead of just recreating the sounds or imitating someone else's interpretation. Furthermore, inspiration leads to the creation of original music. A pianist cannot make music without that initial spark that contributes to the creativity process or the ability to put together notes and rhythms into a meaningful composition. This is true not only for piano players but for all musicians and artists. For instance, let's take the example of the great composers in history. Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many others each had their unique source and type of inspiration—one that fueled and enhanced their creativity, empowering them to write timeless masterpieces that endure till today. This shows how inspiration is a fundamental aspect when it comes to the creation of music. Moreover, creativity is not limited to the physical actions like \\"making music\\" or \\"dancing\\". Inspiration serves as a starting point, ignites imagination, is a motivator and is also important for personal growth and developing artistic skills. It is often seen as the heart of any creative endeavor. It allows artists to imagine, explore, and experiment with new ideas, sounds, or movements—leading to innovation and growth in their craft. Making music and dancing are part of the process, but they rely heavily on inspiration to fuel and guide the process. While musical sounds are the outcome of playing the piano, they could be considered as a mechanical output if devoid of inspiration or emotion. The same applies to dancing—it is the physical realization of an inspirational idea. Hence, a human might choose \\"inspiration\\" as the best response because it encapsulates a core necessity that is integral to playing the piano and any other creative activity. Inspiration is the catalyst that not only launches but also enhances the artistic and creative process, creating a further rippling effect that influences the artist's work, touching the hearts and minds of those who experience it."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Faltu\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

When the show's leading lady Alicia sprains her ankle, she and the wardrobe mistress Betty sneaks out of the rehearsal for medical assistance in which the closest medical facility is a mental hospital. When speaking to the psychiatrist, Betty notices a imprisoned patient who is revealed to be Irving Wallace, a former actor who went insane and committed a killing spree.

The periodic table, introduced in Chapter 3 \\"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\\", lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number (that is, the number of protons in the nucleus). The periodic table is arguably the best tool in all of science; no other branch of science can summarize its fundamental constituents in such a concise and useful way. Many of the physical and chemical properties of the elements are either known or understood based on their positions on the periodic table. Periodic tables are available with a variety of chemical and physical properties listed in each element’s box. What follows here is a more complex version of the periodic table than what was presented inChapter 3 \\"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\\". The Internet is a great place to find periodic tables that contain additional information. One item on most periodic tables is the atomic mass of each element. For many applications, only one or two decimal places are necessary for the atomic mass. However, some applications (especially nuclear chemistry; see Chapter 15 \\"Nuclear Chemistry\\") require more decimal places. The atomic masses in Table 17.1 \\"The Basics of the Elements of the Periodic Table\\" represent the number of decimal places recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the worldwide body that develops standards for chemistry. The atomic masses of some elements are known very precisely, to a large number of decimal places. The atomic masses of other elements, especially radioactive elements, are not known as precisely. Some elements, such as lithium, can have varying atomic masses depending on how their isotopes are isolated. The web offers many interactive periodic table resources. For example, seehttp://www. ptable. Q: What organizational tool, arguably the best in all of science, lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number?

Jose The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"The Turning Point\\" Genre: Action, Thriller Act 1: Introducing the Characters and a Shattered Peace The movie opens with the introduction of Cole Jeffries, a down-on-his-luck former college athlete living in a rough neighborhood in Los Angeles. He is struggling to find work after an injury forced him out of his promising sports career. Cole lives with his loving girlfriend, Maya, and their young daughter, Ava. Despite their difficult circumstances, the family attempts to maintain a sense of normalcy. One day, while Cole is out looking for job opportunities, he encounters a mysterious man named Jose at a local bar. Jose is older, street-wise and seems to have connections and power in the neighborhood. He takes a liking to Cole and starts offering him advice on how to survive and thrive in their shared challenging environment. Act 2: The Descent into Corruption Unable to find honest work and burdened by his growing financial woes, Cole decides to join forces with Jose. He discovers that Jose is involved in organized crime and oversees a local gang that partakes in arms smuggling, drug trafficking, and other illicit activities. As Cole becomes involved in the life of crime, his relationship with Maya starts to crumble. The turning point in their lives comes when Cole, out on a drug run, realizes that his and Maya's old college friend, Detective Travis Maddox, has been assigned to investigate Jose's gang. Act 3: A Desperate Plan When Cole finds out that Maddox is closing in on Jose, he decides he must do something to protect his family and get them out of the life of crime they're entangled in. Panicking, he reluctantly shares his plan with Jose and asks for assistance. Jose, seeing the loyalty and potential in Cole, gives him a handgun as a token of trust and a tool to control their uncertain fate. Out of options, Cole decides to set up a meeting with Maddox to make a deal, offering to help take down Jose's gang in exchange for immunity for himself and his family. Maddox, who wants to bring justice to the neighborhood, reluctantly agrees, but stresses that Cole must hand over the handgun as well. Act 4: The Climactic Standoff On the night of the planned raid on Jose's operations, Cole finds himself torn between his loyalty to Jose and the safety of his family. He assists Maddox and his team in infiltrating their enemy base but ultimately has a change of heart, resulting in a climactic standoff. In the heat of the moment, Cole raises the handgun given by Jose and makes a critical decision. He realizes that the cycle of violence will never end unless he stops contributing to it.

The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued.

If you've been paying attention to the news this week, you might have noticed a few clickbait stories about a little presidential election and some YMCA summer camp games taking place in Brazil. But beneath all the listicles and the GIFs, a violent skirmish is taking root about one of the greatest social justice issues of our time: the demise of the American cargo short. The nation stands on the precipice of civil war: some want to make cargo shorts \\"great again,\\" while others can't remember when cargo shorts ever were good. And though it can be frightening to take a stand on such a polarizing issue, I feel compelled, dear reader, to make my lonely little voice heard amidst all the screams. The cargo short is sick. The cargo short is violent. The cargo short must die, and it must die today (if not today, tomorrow's totally cool too). As a New Yorker, I know I'm not alone in being biased against cargo shorts and the people who wear them. In the city, cargo shorts are unconsciously banned — and those who do wear them are immediately labeled other/outsider/Midwestern tourist. Only someone who came from Oklahoma, the land of diner booths and wide open parking spaces, could feel so entitled to wear something so loose, so basic, so . . . comfortable. It can be easy, delightful even, to build a profile of the cargo-shorts wearer: the man who chooses Journey on the jukebox, steak tips on the Chili menu, 'Blue Man Group' on the TKTS line. He loves Sirius comedy and hates politicians. Is a big fan of Windows 8. Athletic socks? You bet he's got 'em. Every size and every color of the beautiful white rainbow. He's basic without boundaries, without shame, without spite. And of course, it's unfair to judge people solely on the basis of their terrible, terrible shorts. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the wrench-ready pockets. Perhaps people like me are just jealous of the Cargo Man: entitled to wear something so openly basic, he possesses a liberty that I and other small-pocket folks can only dream of. The right to store fat wallets. The ability to hide his keys. The freedom to take a dump in his pants — and have absolutely no one notice. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the pockets. But just because it's wrong and definitely elitist to criticize the cargo shorts wearer doesn't mean we can't hold cargo shorts accountable for the devastating impact they've had on American life and our cultural imagination. The cargo short, by the very laxness of its construction, lowers our sartorial and behavioral standards while giving us nothing in return. The sag built by choice into the seat of the pant screams: \\"It doesn't matter,\\" \\"Why bother?\\" \\"Can we just have sex in the morning?\\" Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption. The more you can purchase, the more you can pocket, the greater your material and spiritual worth. You aren't what you eat or what you sow but what you can store near your balls. Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption Let's not forget where most cargo shorts cut off — right at the knee. Cargo shorts are a part of a long tradition of clothes that shame the inner thigh. In most modern short and skortwear, shorts cut off far above the knee, a place where thighs and stretchmarks can finally peek out and be free. But prurient cargo pants seal one of the sexiest parts of the human body under an amorphous pile of poly-cotton. That's not a problem for most men, but for women — it comes at a tremendous cost. While some women do wear cargo shorts, they often do so at great danger. Head to your nearest Old Navy or Gap and you'll find nothing but line after line of mini-shorts with minipockets that can't hold anything larger than a minigolf pencil. Sure, sometimes women cross the aisle and buy men's cargo pants. And sometimes they are able to find their own in the Women's section of the store. Cargo shorts are fine as long as you're wearing them to Warped Tour — Bobby Big Wheel (@BobbyBigWheel) August 5, 2016 But more often than not, those cargo shorts don't fit right, don't look right, and cost far more than they're worth. Feminism isn't about equality of opportunity; it's about creating better opportunities in the first place. It's not about sharing the cargo wealth, but eliminating the item in the first place. The evidence is in the data. Sales are down. Viral think pieces are up. So many people have complained about their partners use of cargo shorts that, researchers recently found, it has heightened marital dissatisfaction. It can be painful to give up the cargo short collective fantasy we all once shared. The idea that we all looked good in these shorts, should buy these shorts. And while some politicians and writers want you to \\"make cargo shorts great again,\\" remember this: they were never good in the first place. We can build a better world, a world full of tasteful pockets and reasonable seams, zippers that always zip and shorts that cut off just right. Together, we can do this.

This step involves the careful and efficient movement of the coal to power plants, industrial sites, or other locations where the coal will be utilized as a fuel source or for other purposes. It is essential that the coal is handled and transported in a safe and environmentally responsible manner to minimize any potential hazards or negative impacts on the environment. Once the coal is loaded onto the truck, it will typically be taken to a nearby processing facility or directly to the end-user. At the processing facility, the coal may undergo various stages of cleaning, sorting, and grading to remove impurities and ensure that it meets the specific quality standards required by the customer. This process might involve washing, crushing, and other treatments to prepare the coal for its final use. During the transportation process, it is critical that safety and regulatory guidelines are followed to prevent accidents and protect the environment. This may involve securing the coal load properly, adhering to weight restrictions for vehicles, and following designated routes specified by transportation authorities. Drivers who specialize in transporting hazardous materials may be required to obtain proper licenses and certifications to handle and transport the coal legally. In some cases, coal may be transported by other means, such as railways or shipping routes. The decision to use specific transportation methods depends on factors such as distance, cost, and the availability of suitable infrastructure. For instance, a mine located near a port might prefer to export its coal using ships, while a mine in a landlocked region might rely on rail or road transport. Upon arrival at the destination, the coal is unloaded from the truck and either goes through the final stages of processing or is stored temporarily until it is ready to be used. The coal is typically stored in facilities designed to minimize the risk of fire and ensuring the coal remains dry and uncontaminated. Adequate ventilation and monitoring systems are also essential to prevent the accumulation of gases, such as methane, which can pose a significant safety hazard.

The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour. After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made muskets, three 1-pound (0.45 kg) calibre light cannons (piezas) cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze pedreros (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as esmiriles).

Hypothesis: The 1970 Swedish Open was held in august","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that the 1970 Swedish Open was held in August. The context provides us with specific information regarding the event, including the type of tournament, its location, the surface on which the games were played, its place within the 1970 Tour, as well as the winners of the singles titles.

We can only conclude that the gentleman is walking in the street. Here, it is essential to establish a distinction between the two types of reasoning: deductive and inductive. Deductive reasoning implies the drawing of conclusions based on logical premises and facts. It demands that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be correct. Deductive reasoning requires every tidbit of relevant information, and if the information is accurate, the result should yield definite conclusions. In the case of \\"A gentleman walking in the street,\\" we only know that he is walking, with no further information. We cannot apply deductive reasoning to assert that he is heading towards a store. Thus, the statement does not logically follow deductive reasoning rules. Inductive reasoning, on the other hand, involves drawing conclusions based on incomplete information or patterns of occurrence. In this case, it means that even if the available data is not sufficient to derive a conclusion, we can still attempt to make an educated guess. Inductive reasoning aims to develop the most probable outcome, even though it is not always guaranteed to be accurate. If we were to apply inductive reasoning to the given statement, we might assume that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store\\" based on our knowledge of common activities while walking in the street. However, this assumption would be nothing more than speculation, as there are countless reasons why a person would be walking in the street: going to work, visiting friends, exercising, or simply because they enjoy walking. In summary, while it is possible to use inductive reasoning to speculate that a gentleman is on his way to a store, this conclusion is not logically supported using deductive reasoning. The premise \\"A gentleman walking in the street\\" gives insufficient information to determine his destination with certainty."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"a young boy sliding on the grass in an innertube\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The boy is wearing shorts.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"No, dear little one, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true.

Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an..., can you guess it ?

Importance can be either positive or negative depending on the context, but in this specific case, it provides a sense of positivity. 3. \\"Film industry\\" - This is a neutral term referring to the business of producing movies. Given that the words \\"increasingly\\" and \\"important\\" have positive connotations in this context, and the \\"film industry\\" term is neutral, I would classify the phrase \\"increasingly important film industry\\" as positive (option II)."},{"instruction":"Question: Who is killed when the dam bursts ?

Sung by Jagger, the song refers to the Devil, written in the first-person narrative, recounting atrocities committed throughout the history of humanity as if they were somehow \\"inspired\\" (or at least witnessed) by him. Although it has been deemed by some as \\"a homage\\", in reality, no admiration (or even sympathy, for that matter) is declared for the Devil in the song -other than his \\"own\\" request. It is performed in a rock arrangement with a samba rhythm, first appearing as the opening track on their 1968 album Beggars Banquet. Context: The recording of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" began at London's Olympic Sound Studios on 4 June 1968 and continued into the next day; overdubs were done on 8, 9 and 10 June. Personnel included on the recording include Nicky Hopkins on piano, Rocky Dijon on congas and Bill Wyman on maracas. Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, producer Jimmy Miller, Wyman and Richards performed backup vocals, singing the \\"woo woos\\". Richards plays bass on the original recording, and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano. In the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones, Watts commented: \\"Sympathy\\" was one of those sort of songs where we tried everything. The first time I ever heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex ... He played it entirely on his own ... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of different ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of Kenny Clarke would have played on \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" - not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling. On the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in Rolling Stone: It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, but it is also got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive--because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm (candomble). So to white people, it has a very sinister thing about it. But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good. Question: Who produced the song?.

Over the last two decades, the global automobile market has seen a significant shift in consumer preferences in terms of cars' powertrains. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has been attributed to multiple factors, including concerns about the environment, advances in battery technology, governmental policies and subsidies, and growing interest from corporate stakeholders. Major car manufacturers such as Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, and Volkswagen have dedicated significant resources towards the development of electric vehicles. The increasing market share of electric vehicles has not only disrupted the dominance of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars but also led to technological innovations, charging infrastructure expansion, and a change in societal norms related to vehicle ownership and usage. However, there are still challenges associated with electric vehicles, such as range anxiety, initial cost, charging time, and lack of infrastructure in certain regions. Hypothesis: The growing adoption of electric vehicles will lead to the decline of conventional internal combustion engine cars, resulting in a cleaner environment and a change in the structure of the global automobile industry. As the electric vehicle market continues to grow, it is hypothesized that this growth will be at the expense of conventional internal combustion engine cars, leading to a significant reduction in their market share. This change will be driven by increasing consumer demand for cleaner transportation, better performance, and a focus on sustainable energy, alongside support from governments and corporations. A cleaner environment could be achieved by the consequential reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ICE cars, which contribute significantly to climate change. The shift towards electric vehicles would not only stimulate further advancements in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and power management systems but also drive the need for green energy production. Moreover, the growing EV market could alter the structure of the global automobile industry, with companies that specialize in electric vehicle technology experiencing rapid growth, traditional automakers having to adapt to the changing market, and new business models emerging, such as mobility-as-a-service platforms and EV fleet management. Consequently, the electric vehicle revolution will have implications on various levels, from the environment to new industry dynamics, and well beyond the realm of transportation."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"Title: A Most Disappointing Experience at the Hyped-Up Wonderland It was with great anticipation that I visited Wonderland, after being bombarded with raving reviews and friends' constant recommendations. I must admit, I was excited to explore this establishment that promised an exceptional experience and boasted unique attractions. Sadly, I am here to describe the utter disappointment brought upon me and my accompanying guests during our visit to an overly hyped-up place, simply not living up to its reputation. Upon arrival, we were met with an inordinately long queue at the entrance, which apparently is the norm every weekend. The poorly organized ticketing system left most attendees, including myself, questioning whether it was worth waiting in the sun for hours just to enter the facility. The whole process was painfully slow and certainly not a great way to start off our highly anticipated day. The ticket prices were astonishingly high, having chosen the package deal that boasted access to all attractions, we eventually found ourselves feeling robbed by the steep costs. Seemingly, we had miserably fallen prey to good marketing strategies and paid more than what the place had to offer. Once inside Wonderland, the layout and the signage appeared chaotic and overcrowded. To my dismay, the lack of clear signage forced us to wander about aimlessly for a considerable amount of time before finding any of the attractions we had come to visit. This maze-like layout wasted precious time we could have spent enjoying the attractions, adding to our mounting frustration. Furthermore, the place's cleanliness (or lack thereof) was an appalling disappointment. Trash bins were filled to the brim; litter was strewn across walkways, and the unpleasant stench of unattended spills was noticeable in various areas. This presented a highly unwelcoming environment and made it hard for us to appreciate any of the attractions. At the food courts, the quality of food was subpar at best, and the overpriced menu left a lot to be desired. With limited options, we found ourselves waiting in excessively long queues, only to be handed a tasteless, cold meal that hardly resembled the enticing picture on the menu. We certainly expected better after spending quite a fortune on the overall experience. Another disheartening aspect of our visit was the staff's lackluster service. In numerous instances, we felt misinformed or simply brushed off by employees who seemed uninterested in helping or answering our questions. Admittedly, not every team member we approached was unhelpful, but a more considerable number of them dampened our overall experience. Lastly, the Wonderland attractions. Some rides were either permanently closed or under maintenance, information we were not made aware of when purchasing our tickets. As for the functional rides and attractions, the thrill factor failed to justify the time spent standing in queues, and the repeated breakdowns of a few only further exasperated our state of aggravation. In conclusion, I regret to say that my visit to Wonderland was a resounding letdown. What promised to be a fantastic day out was marred by poorly managed ticketing systems, a cluttered layout, substandard cleanliness, overpriced and tasteless food options, lackluster staff, and mediocre attractions. I would not recommend this place to any friends or family members. Save your valuable time, money, and effort for more deserving establishments."},{"instruction":"At the time of this game, northern New Jersey (and, indeed, a vast majority of the BosWash area) was recovering from the widespread damage and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy. Played just days after the storm made landfall on the east coast, the blackouts and flooding even affected the visiting Steelers' travel schedule, and the team would be forced to fly into the area on the morning of the contest as opposed to the usual day beforehand. Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth. New York would fail to accumulate any further points in the contest and, despite a botched fake field goal attempt by the Steelers, a 1-yard touchdown run by Pittsburgh back Isaac Redman gave the Steelers the lead and, eventually, the win.

His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing.

The first known banknote was first developed in China during the Tang and Song dynasties, starting in the 7th century. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618 -- 907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. During the Yuan Dynasty, banknotes were adopted by the Mongol Empire.

Answer: This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam , supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam , supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. Question: how did the vietnam war end","output":"The Vietnam War ended with the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, marking the victory of communist North Vietnam and the unification of the country under communist rule as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The conflict began in the mid-1950s, and it was a long, drawn-out engagement with significant consequences for all parties involved, particularly the Vietnamese people and the United States. Several events and agreements led to the eventual end of the Vietnam War. One of the most significant events that laid the groundwork for the end of the war was the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The Paris Peace Accords aimed at establishing peace in Vietnam and creating an environment for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. Key provisions of the agreement included establishing a cease-fire, the withdrawal of U.S. troops and military forces, the release of prisoners of war, and creating a framework for a political solution for South Vietnam. In March 1973, under the terms of the Paris Peace Accords, the last U.S. combat troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, leaving South Vietnamese forces to defend themselves. However, the cease-fire did not last long, and fighting resumed between North and South Vietnamese forces. In 1974, North Vietnam launched a series of offensives against the South, taking advantage of the weakened state of the South Vietnamese military and the lack of U.S. support. Facing mounting pressure and multiple battles throughout the country, the South Vietnamese government and its forces began to crumble. By early 1975, the North Vietnamese forces were mounting a large-scale offensive that ultimately led to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. On April 30, 1975, the North Vietnamese army entered Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, without encountering any significant resistance. This event marked the end of the Vietnam War and led to the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule. In the following months and years, tens of thousands of South Vietnamese who had fought against the communists or supported the United States were executed or sent to re-education camps, and millions of others became refugees seeking asylum in other countries. In conclusion, the Vietnam War ended with the dramatic fall of Saigon and the triumph of communist North Vietnam over South Vietnam, leading to a unified communist Vietnam. The Paris Peace Accords, the withdrawal of U.S. forces, and the eventual collapse of the South Vietnamese government were critical factors contributing to the war's end. The Vietnam War left a significant impact on all parties involved, with lasting consequences that are still felt and studied today."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: 1634: The Ram Rebellion, followedBy, 1635: The Cannon Law; 1634: The Ram Rebellion, precededBy, 1634: The Galileo Affair.

And in ancient Egyptian fairy tales, the hippo was a goddess that guided the dead to the afterworld. Despite their popular appeal, hippos, as well as other animals, have difficulty when their needs conflict with those of humans. The early Egyptians liked to hunt hippos for their teeth and because they were dangerous animals. Amulets to protect babies from demons were made from hippo bones.

Frank Baum, was an American author chiefly famous for his children's books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels. He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), police corruption and false evidence (Phoebe Daring), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work). Baum was born in Chittenango, New York in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry, and was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (nee Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. \\"Lyman\\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \\"Frank\\". His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Frank was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at Peekskill Military Academy but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home. Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they would give to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with friends. At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record, and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs. Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life. Baum embarked on his lifetime infatuation--and wavering financial success--with the theater. A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater -- temporarily -- and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's dry goods company in Syracuse. This experience may have influenced his story \\"The Suicide of Kiaros\\", first published in the literary journal The White Elephant. A fellow clerk one day was found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide. Baum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks. In 1880, his father built him a theater in Richburg, New York, and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. The Maid of Arran proved a modest success, a melodrama with songs based on William Black's novel A Princess of Thule. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical musical, as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and operettas. On November 9, 1882, Baum married Maud Gage, a daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a famous women's suffrage and feminist activist. While Baum was touring with The Maid of Arran, the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama Matches, destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including Matches, as well as costumes. In July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, Dakota Territory where he opened a store called \\"Baum's Bazaar\\". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store, so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer where he wrote the column Our Landlady. Following the death of Sitting Bull at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum urged the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below). On January 3, 1891 he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the Wounded Knee Massacre: The Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. A recent analysis of these editorials has challenged their literal interpretation, suggesting that the actual intent of Baum was to generate sympathy for the Indians via obnoxious argument, ostensibly promoting the contrary position. Baum's description of Kansas in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is based on his experiences in drought-ridden South Dakota. During much of this time, Matilda Joslyn Gage was living in the Baum household. While Baum was in South Dakota, he sang in a quartet which included James Kyle, who became one of the first Populist (People's Party) Senators in the U.S. Ask a question about this article.","output":"L. Frank Baum was a famous American writer who is best known for his children's books, especially The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. He wrote many stories, poems, and plays too. Baum was born in New York in 1856 and liked to write even when he was a little kid. He also loved theater and acting. When he grew up, he got married and moved to a place called Dakota Territory, where he had a store and worked for a newspaper. His stories and books were very imaginative, and some of his ideas seemed like they were from the future, like computers and smartphones. His most famous book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was made into a famous movie in 1939, and people still enjoy his stories today."},{"instruction":"Předmět: Požadavky na zdraví a bezpečnost v civilním letectví v EU Odpověď Komise (3. března 2005) Translate this to English?","output":"Subject: Requirements for Health and Safety in Civil Aviation in the EU Answer from the Commission (March 3, 2005) This is like a title for a letter or a report.

Jodi Arias' testimony was a surprise move by defense attorneys in a sensational murder trial in Phoenix that has become a daily fixture on cable news with its lurid stories of sex, lies, religion, betrayal and violence. Arias, 32, could become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row if convicted. Arias' testimony aimed to portray her as a childhood abuse victim and naive teenager who stayed with boyfriends even after they cheated on her and became violent at times. Defense attorneys claim it was a similar scenario throughout her relationship with Travis Alexander, a successful businessman and motivational speaker, who Arias killed in June 2008, she says, in self-defense. She is charged with killing the 30-year-old man in what prosecutors describe as a fit of jealous rage after she found out he'd planned to take a trip to Mexico with another woman. Authorities say she stabbed and slashed him 27 times, slit his throat from ear to ear and shot him in the forehead, leaving his bloody body in the bathroom of his suburban Phoenix home to be found five days later by friends. Arias claims it was self-defense as Alexander attacked her after inviting her to his home for sex on the day of the killing. Her trial began in early January with a series of salacious details about a torrid romance between Arias and Alexander after they met at a Las Vegas conference in late 2006. She claims they dated for about five months, then broke up but continued to see each other for sex up until the day of his death. She initially told police she knew nothing of the killing, then later blamed it on masked intruders. She finally admitted her involvement, but claimed self-defense -- kill or be killed by the enraged man. She testified Monday that she lied early in the investigation about not being at the scene of the crime because she planned to commit suicide so there would never be a trial. \\"At the time, I had plans to commit suicide. So I was extremely confident that no jury would convict me because I didn't expect any of you to be here,\\" Arias told jurors. \\"I planned to be dead.\\" In a soft-spoken voice, Arias calmly described how an idyllic childhood in California turned abusive when she was about 7 years old. She said her parents beat her with belts and wooden spoons, and the abuse later escalated into shoving her into furniture and slapping her in the face for misdeeds such as sneaking out of the house. Her mother sat in the front row of the courtroom and showed no emotion as Arias described her childhood. Arias then went on to recount other stories from her youth that sometimes turned bizarre. She described meeting a high school boyfriend at a carnival when she was 15 and he was 18. Arias said the two dated for a while, but she broke it off because \\"he had all kinds of wild ideas.\\" \\"He entertained the belief in vampires,\\" she said, adding that he wanted the pair to move to San Francisco to hunt them. She said a few months after she broke up with the boy, she learned he was so distraught over the relationship's demise that he had slit both his wrists and tried to kill himself. Arias said she reconnected with him about \\"19 months\\" later after a man she met in her father's restaurant had told her that the \\"second coming\\" of Jesus Christ would occur in late 1997. \\"I was really naive and I kind of believed him,\\" Arias testified. She wanted to warn her former boyfriend, she said. But she said it wasn't long until the relationship turned stormy. She discovered he had been exchanging romantic emails with another woman, but she continued to date him. Later, she said he tried to strangle her and told her \\"how he would kill each member of my family.\\" Throughout the trial, defense attorneys have tried to depict Alexander as a liar and cheat who told Arias and other girlfriends he was a devout Mormon saving sex for marriage, while in reality he was having sex with multiple women, cheating on some with others. Prosecutors have portrayed Arias as a jealous ex-girlfriend who couldn't let go of Alexander and stalked him for months after their breakup until finally snapping and killing him. Authorities say they found her hair and bloody palm print at the scene of the killing, along with time-stamped photographs on a camera discovered inside Alexander's washing machine that place Arias there on the day he died. The photos included one of Arias nude on his bed, one of Alexander alive in the shower, then one of his body on the bathroom floor. Defense attorneys have yet to explain why Arias apparently attempted to clean the scene and what happened to the weapons. Authorities say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25 caliber gun, the same caliber Arias' grandparents reported stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing.","output":"\\"Disturbing Descent: Jodi Arias' Testimony Reveals a Life of Abuse, Lies, and Violent Love Affairs\\""},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - A Singspiel (plural: Singspiele; literally \\"sing-play\\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil. History. Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \\"Singspiel\\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - One Thousand and One Nights (\\"kitb alf layla wa-layla\\") is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as \\"The Arabian Nights' Entertainment\\". - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber to a German libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer , based on a story in One Thousand and One Nights . It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue . The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style . - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. - A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.

Justification: It is not possible to tell because human behavior and thought processes are far too complex and nuanced to be fully captured and predicted solely based on their social media interactions. Though social media platforms provide a glimpse into a person's interests, opinions, and social connections, they often only showcase a curated or selective version of one's true self. Determining an individual's future actions or thoughts would require a deeper understanding of various factors - such as their upbringing, personal experiences, current mental state, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences - that extend beyond their digital footprint. Furthermore, people may post content on social media that misrepresents their true feelings, opinions, or beliefs, either intentionally or unintentionally. In some cases, individuals may adopt different personas online to fit into specific communities or to explore different aspects of their personality.

McDonough said on NBC’s Meet the Press that “to communicate with them we have to be very clear, very forthright. This is an opportunity to be both with the Iranians....” He said, “nobody is rebutting the intelligence; nobody doubts the intelligence” that is the basis for President Barack Obama pinning the blame for an August 21 chemical weapons attack in Syria on President Bashar Assad's regime which is fighting to suppress a rebellion that began in 2011. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough visits Meet the Press to discuss recently released footage of a chemical assault on the Syrian people. McDonough noted that “our troops have not been subject to chemical weapons attacks since World War I” and argued that “we have to make sure that for the sake of our guys – our men and women on the front lines – that we reinforce this prohibition against using chemical weapons.” If Assad is not deterred, he will put chemical weapons on the front lines in his battle against the Syrian rebels and that would mean “a greater risk of them being proliferated” and perhaps falling into terrorists’ hands, McDonough argued. He added that “the momentum on the battle field will be changed by a targeted, limited effort” but he said ultimately “there’s not a military resolution” to the civil war in Syria, only a “political, diplomatic resolution.” McDonough’s appearance on Meet the Press and other Sunday talk shows was one part of an intense public offensive headed by Obama himself, including the president doing interviews Monday with six television networks and culminating in his speech to the nation Tuesday night. McDonough said Obama wants Congress to be “a full partner” in military action against Assad’s regime. Obama faces one of the crucial weeks of his presidency with the Senate headed for a vote as early as Wednesday to end debate on a measure authorizing an attack on Syria; the measure’s supporters need 60 votes to move it ahead to final passage. Reaction from members of Congress has ranged from endorsing an attack to wariness to fervent opposition. The division on the issue hasn’t followed party lines. Sen. Tom Udall, D- N.M., who voted against the resolution authorizing use of military force last week in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Meet the Press Sunday that he was “very disappointed that the administration has given up” on the United Nations and “on rallying the world.” The American people, Udall said, “don’t want to be embroiled in a Middle Eastern civil war; this is an act of war that we’re going to take. We haven’t exhausted all of our political, economic, and diplomatic alternatives.” Obama, he charged, “is moving much too rapidly down the war path and not trying to find a political solution….” Another Democrat, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D- Calif. said she was leaning against the resolution authorizing use of force. She said it is not clear to her that United States national security is directly at risk from Assad’s regime. “I haven’t heard that Assad wants to use the weapons against us; I haven’t heard that he wants to use the weapons against our allies (or ) that he’s moving them to terrorist organizations.” She said, “The minute that one of those cruise missiles lands in there, we are in the Syrian war. It’s a civil war and we’re taking sides with the rebels,” some of whom, she said, were linked to al Qaeda. Sanchez indicated that she’s quite skeptical of Obama’s argument that any military action will be carefully limited: “For the president to say, ‘this is just, you know, a very quick thing and we’re out of there.’ That’s how long wars start.” Republican Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who he said he couldn’t support Obama’s plan, agreed with Sanchez: “Once we hit, this is an act of war. Little wars start big wars.” He called an attack on Assad “kind of a face-saving measure” by Obama “after he drew the red line” against use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime. Even Rep. Peter King, R- N.Y., who supports an attack on the Assad regime and warned Sunday of the danger of an “Iran-Syrian axis in the Middle East,” harshly criticized Obama whom he said has been “vacillating. I can’t imagine Harry Truman or John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan or Dwight Eisenhower ever putting the nation in a position like this….” He said, “I wish he was more of a commander-in-chief than a community organizer.” In another example of the Syria issue crossing party lines, Sen. Mark Pryor, D- Ark, who is up for re-election next year, announced Saturday that he opposes an attack, while his Republican opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, has said he strongly supports military action and wants to go even further and topple the Assad regime to achieve “an ultimate victory in Syria” with “a pro-Western, moderate native Syrian government” taking Assad’s place. Pryor said Saturday that the Obama administration had to “prove a compelling national security interest, clearly define a mission that has a definitive end-state, and then build a true coalition of allies” that would take part in action against Assad. But “based on the information presented to me and the evidence I have gathered, I do not believe these criteria have been met, and I cannot support military action against Syria at this time,” Pryor said. Obama said Friday, “it’s conceivable that at the end of the day I don’t persuade a majority of the American people that it's the right thing to do,” but he added that sometimes members of Congress must do what they think is right even if they go against their constituents’ wishes. Obama has not explicitly said whether he might choose to launch an attack anyway even if Congress votes down a resolution authorizing him to attack Syria. He rebuffed reporters’ questions on that point in a press conference Friday at the meeting of G-20 nations in St. Petersburg, Russia. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar Assad has emerged in the U.S. media, granting an interview to CBS' Charlie Rose, which will be aired Monday. While the network did not release direct quotes from the exchange, Rose said Sunday on \\"Face the Nation\\" that Assad denied having anything to do with the chemical weapons attack that has the world on edge. \\"He does accept some of the responsibility\\" for the attack that killed almost 1,500 Syrian civilians - including hundreds of children, Rose said. \\"I asked that very question: 'Do you feel any remorse?' He said, 'Of course I do,' but it did not come in a way that was sort of deeply felt inside. It was much more of a calm recitation of anybody who's a leader of a country would feel terrible about what's happened to its citizens.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said that an impending U.S. attack on Syria would send a message to Iranian leaders that they should not feel free to develop nuclear weapons. 2.

A 20-year-old Texas man who was convicted of raping of a teenage schoolmate but sentenced to only five years' probation must also undergo the standard probationary conditions, including evaluation for sex offender treatment, a Dallas district court judge ruled Thursday. Sir Young pleaded guilty to the attack on a 14-year-old girl at a Dallas high school in 2011. Judge Jeanine Howard, who sentenced Young last week, did not impose the standard probationary conditions. She said he was 'not your typical sex offender' and questioned whether the girl had embellished her story. He was ordered to spend 45 days in jail. The initial punishment for Young sparked a backlash when a prior judge in","output":"the case, Judge Jeanine Howard, faced criticism for issuing a lenient sentence and not imposing standard probationary conditions on Young. Many argued that this decision sent a dangerous message regarding sexual assault, diminishing the gravity of the crime and potentially discouraging other victims from coming forward. In response to the public outcry and to ensure that the justice system upholds its responsibility of protecting victims and holding perpetrators accountable, the Dallas district court judge revisited Young's case. Given the severity of the offense and the urgency to maintain the credibility of the legal system, the judge decided to impose the standard probationary conditions on Young, in addition to the initial 45 days in jail. This decision ultimately demonstrates that the judiciary system acknowledges the importance of enforcing proper consequences for those convicted of sexual assault, regardless of whether they fit the label of a \\"typical\\" sex offender. At the same time, it serves as a reminder that legal authorities must be cautious in their decisions and avoid biases that could compromise the treatment of victims and the punishment of criminals."},{"instruction":"Do these mean the same?

Now, putting these steps together, here's an example of a negative review: Title: \\"PhoneX - Not Living Up to Expectations\\" Introduction: I recently purchased a PhoneX with high hopes due to its sleek design and impressive specifications. Unfortunately, after using the device for a couple of weeks, I was left disappointed by a few glaring issues. Issue 1 - Poor Battery Life: The PhoneX's battery life is abysmal. Even with moderate usage, the phone barely lasts through the day, requiring me to carry a portable charger with me everywhere. The quick charging feature promised in the advertisement doesn't seem to make up for this major drawback. Issue 2 - Unresponsive Touchscreen: To make matters worse, the phone's touchscreen frequently becomes unresponsive, causing delays in basic tasks such as unlocking the device or typing a text message. This has led me to miss important calls and messages, while making me feel frustrated with the overall user experience. Positive Aspects: Despite these issues, I do appreciate the phone's sleek design, and when the touchscreen works, the interface is easy to navigate. The camera quality is also commendable, producing sharp and vibrant images. Conclusion-Final thoughts: While the PhoneX has some redeeming qualities, its poor battery life and unresponsive touchscreen significantly hinder the overall user experience. I would not recommend this device until these issues are addressed in a future update."},{"instruction":"1). No; 2).

What happened down there was \\"a rout\\", \\"a surrender\\", \\"a humiliation, \\"a pathetic showing\\". This wasn't just kicking a team when they were down, this was a savaging done with a smile and the visitors left themselves wide open to it. So many strong, and justified, words were used about the way Scotland played and the manner in which they were coursed around Twickenham for 80 minutes, but the most memorable was one used by not just a Scottish player, but the Scottish captain. \\"Useless,\\" said John Barclay. Nobody was of a mind to disagree with him. It's not coaches that are needed in the Scotland camp this week, it's psychologists. And medics, of course. Lots of them. Seven England tries and now seven more injuries to add to the misery. Physically, emotionally, spiritually - and every other type of ally you care to mention - that was one bruising day at Twickenham. Mark Bennett has already been ruled out of the Italy game on Saturday, thereby joining Greig Laidlaw, Duncan Taylor, Alasdair Dickinson, WP Nel, Josh Strauss and John Hardie in the cast of the stricken. Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour and Ryan Wilson are trying to recover in time after getting concussed. Finn Russell and Huw Jones have to get scans on knee knocks. Richie Gray is getting one on his hamstring. James Robson, the team doctor, may as well borrow a flashing ambulance light and stick it on his head for the next week. He's going to be a busy, busy man. Scotland were caught in the perfect storm on Saturday. They chose this day of all days to deliver a giant calamity of a display, a day when England produced one of their best Tests in years. England were quietly brooding after some bad press, a little angry at the flak sent their way after Italy, maybe a little embarrassed at their slowness in dealing with Italy's tactics, perhaps a tad indignant at all the chat about the revived Scots and how they were heading south to consign 1983 to the dustbin once and for all. The hosts had motivation coming out of their ears. Scotland had weakness coming out of the woodwork. What they need to do now is clear. They need to harness the hurt and use it against Italy in their final match of the Six Nations and the farewell Test in Vern Cotter's reign. They need to do to the Italians what England did to them. Power, pace, deception, invention, tries and more tries. A bonus-point win sends them back up the table from their current slot in fifth. A good season is still there to be secured if the Italians are blasted. The horror of Twickenham can be lessened if Scotland finish third in the table with three wins and a six-point loss in Paris when injury befell them in freakish circumstances. That's definite progress. Twickenham will hang in the air like the dirtiest cloud. That can't be erased, but neither should the victories over Ireland and Wales. Scotland are moving forward, but there was the most brutal reality check on Saturday. When England get it right they're on a different planet. But here's the news. When England get it right they're a match for New Zealand at their ultimate. On Saturday's form, England would happily go toe-to-toe with the All Blacks, home or away, summer, autumn, winter or spring. On Saturday, Scotland have a chance to finish with a flourish, but you have to fear now that terminal damage has been done to their hopes of having a chunky representation on the Lions tour. It was instructive to hear Warren Gatland's words when he visited Scotland last week. The Lions coach spoke of the importance of the game at Twickenham, suggesting that winning matches at home was proof of Scotland's improvement, but that winning games away from home was what he was looking for from the Scotland contenders. Had Scotland lived with England and taken them to the wire then Gatland would have had some interesting decisions to make. He'd have seen players going to an intimidating stadium and standing up to a champion team. They're the kind of customers he needs in New Zealand. The fact that they were brutalised puts an image in the head of the Kiwi taking out a red pen and drawing a line through the names of those Scots who advanced their case so impressively against Ireland and Wales. England will make up the bulk of Gatland's squad, which will number about 38 players. If they go on and win a second Grand Slam while setting a new world record for consecutive Test wins then as many as 20 of Eddie Jones' squad could travel - and they'd go on merit. If they're denied in Dublin then the by-product of that would be more Irishmen on the tour. Either way, it's bad news for Scotland. They had a lamentable day that probably destroyed the Lions chances of all bar three or four, but they've got to go again. The good work they've done this season demands a proper finale against Italy, a resounding response to the nightmare.

According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney.

Soon afterward, the band reformed as Funeral for a Friend; the name is derived from a song by Planes Mistaken for Stars, one of Davies' favourite bands at the time. During the start of the New Year they parted ways with second guitarist Kerry Roberts (Kris Coombs-Roberts's brother) and found a suitable replacement in Darran Smith (ex-Tripcage). The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band From This Moment On. Upon hearing the tracks, Mighty Atom Records approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut EP, Between Order and Model (2002). Before the EP's release, Andi Morris (bass) quit, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band's only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans' screaming role. In 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, Four Ways to Scream Your Name, produced and mixed by Colin Richardson. In mid-2003, the band secured their first Kerrang! award, winning the award for \\"Best UK Newcomer\\", beating The Darkness, who won in all other nominated categories.

While the premise presents a scene of a woman wearing heavy makeup in front of a store with a neon sign saying, \\"Red Light,\\" it does not explicitly mention a beauty contest, nor does it provide enough context to make a direct connection between the two. Here are some observations about the premise: 1. The woman is wearing heavy makeup - This could suggest various reasons behind her choice of wearing makeup, such as an event, a personal preference or style, or even a job requirement. However, the premise does not specify that the event in question is a beauty contest. 2. She is standing in front of a store with a neon sign saying, \\"Red Light\\" - This could suggest the store's name, or it might be descriptive of the store's business or theme. The term \\"Red Light\\" might imply a connection to a red-light district, which typically refers to an area where adult entertainment or other related businesses are concentrated. While it's possible that a beauty contest could be held in such a place, it is by no means confirmed by the information provided in the premise.

Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \\"lesser-degree rape\\" (mindre grov valdtakt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain. In 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \\"lesser degree rape\\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020. On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\\", she said.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. and the situation: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans. Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village. Answer the following question: Which student studied about a village that had a more dependable food supply? A:","output":"Harry studied a village that had a more dependable food supply. As mentioned in the background information, agriculture was invented around 10,000 years ago and provided humans with a more reliable and abundant food source. This allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time, and consequently, birth rates increased due to the availability of more food and the benefits of a settled life. On the other hand, Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement, which predates the invention of agriculture by around 5,000 years. During this time, humans were predominantly hunter-gatherers, relying on foraging, hunting, and fishing for sustenance. This lifestyle did not offer a dependable food supply as resources were seasonal and often required significant effort and mobility to locate. In conclusion, Harry's 5,000-year-old village study provided insights into a time when humans had a more stable and dependable food supply, thanks to the invention of agriculture. Whereas, Kim's study of the 15,000-year-old settlement focused on a period before the onset of agricultural practices, when humans were more reliant on hunting and gathering, which was comparatively less reliable as a food source."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Chinabank, foundationPlace, Manila; Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, foundingDate, 1901-07-01; Chinabank, foundationPlace, Insular Government of the Philippine Islands","output":"Once upon a time, there was a bank called Chinabank, and it was born in a big city called Manila.

The series revolves around the adventures of Dr. Henry Walton \\"Indiana\\" Jones Jr., an archaeologist and college professor who seeks to uncover and preserve important historical artifacts from around the world. Throughout the films, other scientific fields also emerge as significant aspects in the storyline, allowing for an intellectual blend of information and entertainment. The film series consists of four primary installments: \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" (1981), \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" (1984), \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" (1989), and \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" (2008). 1. Archaeology The most evident scientific field featured in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" film series is archaeology, which focuses on the study and excavation of ancient human cultures through the recovery and analysis of material evidence. As an archaeologist, Indiana Jones is tasked with the responsibility of locating and retrieving these historical artifacts, all the while navigating a treacherous landscape filled with rival treasure hunters and various political intrigues. Each film highlights different archaeological discoveries and mythical artifacts that are central to the plot, from biblical relics like the Ark of the Covenant in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" to the sacred Sankara Stones in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\\" 2. History History is another significant scientific field featured in the film series, as Indiana Jones frequently relies on his extensive knowledge of historical events and cultures to guide him through his many adventures. The stories involve ancient civilizations and religious ideologies, such as Egyptian mythology in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark, \\"Hinduism and the Thuggee cult in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\\" the legend of the Holy Grail and connections to Christianity in \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\\" and Mesoamerican and Ancient Alien theories in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" The films also provide historical context to the periods in which they are set, most notably through their portrayal of World War II-era politics and the Cold War in the 1950s. 3. Anthropology Interwoven with archaeology and history in the films, anthropology sheds light on the cultural and social aspects of the various societies and civilizations encountered by Indiana Jones. By focusing on the human experience, the franchise delves into the customs, beliefs, values, and legends that shape these societies. Dialogues, rituals, and settings contribute to the in-depth understanding of past civilizations and the impact they have on modern-day cultures. 4. Geology Geology is featured as a supporting scientific discipline in the film series, as the intense and varied landscapes that Indiana Jones explores are often dictated by geological formations: caverns, tunnels, deserts, mountains, and more. The geology of the different sites and excavation locations plays a significant role in the overall intrigue and danger associated with uncovering these ancient artifacts. 5. Physics and Engineering Although less prominent than the other fields mentioned, physics and engineering concepts make an appearance in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" film series as plot devices. Many of the elaborate traps, puzzles, and mechanisms encountered throughout the films rely on a mix of basic and advanced principles of physics and engineering, such as counterweights, levers, pressure points, and even the refraction of light. In conclusion, the \\"Indiana Jones\\" film series skillfully integrates multiple scientific disciplines, including archaeology, history, anthropology, geology, and physics and engineering, to create a captivating and intellectually engaging narrative. Through these scientific fields, Indiana Jones delivers an insightful and entertaining cinematic experience that highlights the wonders and complexities of human civilization and the natural world."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: where do the miami dolphins have training camp?","output":"The Miami Dolphins, a professional American football team and a member of the National Football League (NFL), hold their training camp at the Baptist Health Training Complex (formerly known as the Miami Dolphins Training Facility) in Miami Gardens, Florida.

A majestic fort. A royal dynasty that no longer rules. A king without a kingdom. Yet Eklavya (Amitabh Bachchan), their royal guard, lives in a time warp. He lives only to protect the fort, the dynasty, and the king. For nine generations Eklavya's family has protected Devigarh, a centuries-old citadel in Rajasthan. His marksmanship is the stuff of legends. His unflinching loyalty inspires ballads. Eklavya has spent his entire life serving the royals and closely guarding their secrets but now he's getting old and increasingly blind. Unable to cope with the suffocating customs of his land, the heir, Prince Harshwardhan (Saif Ali Khan), has stayed away in London. But the sudden demise of the queen, Rani Suhasinidevi (Sharmila Tagore), forces the Prince back to the kingdom he had left behind. The queen leaves a letter for her son in which she tells him that his biological father is actually Eklavya. The Prince's return brings a rush of joy into the moribund fort. His mentally challenged twin sister, Princess Nandini (Raima Sen), and his childhood love, Rajjo (Vidya Balan), are delighted to see him. But the joy of reunion is short-lived.

An event is defined as a single word representing something that happened, is happening, or may happen. An event can be factual or hypothetical, positive or negative, certain or uncertain. While most events are based on verbs, an event can also be based on a noun (ex. storm, snow, rainfall) or a copula verb (is, was, been, etc.). The event must not be a pronoun or an adjective. For noun events with multiple words, use the last word in the phrase as event. Problem:Passage: \\"For the missing link between Poipet and Sisophon (Cambodia), the construction of the railway will start early next year, using the rail tracks donated by Malaysia while the ADB (Asian Development Bank) would be financing the construction work,\\" Chan told reporters after officiating the 28th ASEAN Railways CEO's conference here. Chan said once construction of the missing link is completed, it will enable the movement of trains from Singapore to Phnom Penh (Cambodia). Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identifying an event from a passage Usage: Event - construction. Construction is an event because it represents something that is going to happen in the context of the passage (the construction of a railway). Part #2: Single-word representation Usage: Event - start. \\"Start\\" is a single word representing the beginning of the construction process. This meets the criteria because it's a single word that represents an action. Part #3: Event can be factual or hypothetical Usage: Event - movement. The movement of trains is a hypothetical event that will occur once the construction is completed. This meets the criteria because the movement is not yet happening but is expected to happen in the future. Part #4: Event can be positive or negative Usage: Event - enable. The enablement of train movement is a positive event, as it suggests an improvement in transportation. This meets the criteria because it demonstrates a positive outcome of the construction. Part #5: Event can be certain or uncertain Usage: Event - financing. Financing the construction work is an event with some level of uncertainty, as it depends on the Asian Development Bank's involvement. This meets the criteria because it represents an event with an element of uncertainty. Part #6: Event can be based on a verb, noun, or copula verb Usage: Event - donated. Donated is a verb representing an action (Malaysia donating rail tracks). This meets the criteria because it is a verb-based event. Part #7: Event must not be a pronoun or adjective Usage: Event - link. The \\"missing link\\" is a noun phrase representing the event of connecting two places by a railway. Since the last word \\"link\\" is a noun and not an adjective or pronoun, it meets the criteria."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: classroom, desk, laptop","output":"Step 1: Identify the key concepts - In this case, I need to create a sentence that includes \\"classroom,\\" \\"desk,\\" and \\"laptop.\\" Step 2: Determine the logical relationship between the concepts - A classroom provides a setting, a desk is typically found in a classroom, and a laptop can be used on a desk.

Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Now, I have a new situation: Pam and Angela live in different cities and are talking to each other on the phone while they are sitting outside.

Although they don't get to see each other much any more due to the distance between them, they make sure to stay in regular contact. Answer this question please: Which woman gets more oxygen per single breath? The answer is:","output":"Pam gets more oxygen per single breath. This is because she lives in Dunder, a city located at sea level, where the air pressure is higher, and therefore the air is denser.

Sentence 1: Subject(Easthope) + birth information(born at Tewkesbury on 29 October 1784) + family relationships(was the eldest son of Thomas Easthope by Elizabeth, daughter of John Leaver of Overbury, Worcestershire) Sentence 2: Subject(Easthope) + birth information(born on 29 October 1784 in Tewkesbury) + family relationships(was the eldest son of Elizabeth of Thomas Easthope, daughter of John Leaver of Overbury, Worcestershire) Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences. - Both sentences mention Easthope being born on 29 October 1784 in Tewkesbury - Both sentences mention John Leaver of Overbury, Worcestershire as the grandfather Step 3: Identify major differences between the two sentences. - In Sentence 1: Thomas Easthope is the father and Elizabeth (daughter of John Leaver) is the mother. - In Sentence 2: Elizabeth of Thomas Easthope is mentioned as the mother, and the father is not clearly mentioned. Step 4: Conclusion Though the two sentences are similar in many aspects, they are not accurate paraphrases of each other due to the confusion and incorrect structure in Sentence 2 in explaining the family relationships. The key difference lies in the wording related to Easthope's parents, where Sentence 1 is clear that Thomas Easthope is the father and Elizabeth is the mother, while Sentence 2 has an incorrect and unclear structure that confuses the relationships."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Each spring, a party from a fort travels to Hudson Bay to trade pelts for winter provisions, but, in 1815, nobody returns. Brigitte and Ginger are lost with their horse in the Canadian wilderness when they come across a seemingly abandoned camp. An elderly Indian woman, who warns them that they must kill a boy to prevent one sister from killing the other, gives them each a pendant. As their startled horse runs off, Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but the hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. He leads them to Fort Bailey, where they take refuge. Ginger says they are the daughters of a drowned trader and are seeking passage east. Werewolves have besieged the fort for some time. Murphy, the fort's physician, inspects Brigitteâs wound and applies a leech, surreptitiously testing for werewolf infection. They are given a room that belonged to Wallace's son Geoffrey. Awakened by a voice, Ginger investigates the corridors, where she eventually finds the source: a deformed boy kept in a small, bolted unlit room; he bites her shoulder as he flees. When Ginger and Brigitte attempt to leave, James confronts them. While Ginger and James are fighting, werewolves attack, killing one of the residents. Reverend Gilbert leads the sisters to an allegedly safe building, which actually contains a werewolf. The sisters run up the stairs, chased by the werewolf, but the hunter appears and kills it. As Ginger and Brigitte are going to their room Ginger's nose starts to bleed; a sign that she is infected. The sisters discover the boy who bit Ginger is Wallace's son, Geoffrey.

The employment rate was steady at a record 74.5%, while wage growth picked up pace. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.7% compared with a year earlier. Growth in pay including bonuses rose 0.2 percentage points to 2.8% for the year to November. However, the number of people in work slipped by 9,000 to just over 31.8 million, the ONS said. It was the second consecutive report to show a decline in the number of people in work - the first back-to-back fall since mid-2015. The number of full-time workers was 209,000 higher at 23.25 million people, while the total of part-time employees jumped 86,000 to 8.55 million. Employment minister Damian Hinds described the figures as encouraging and highlighted the \\"strength and resilience\\" of the UK labour market. David Freeman, ONS senior statistician, said: \\"While employment is little changed on the quarter, the rate remains at an historic high.\\" \\"The rate at which pay is increasing continues to pick up in cash terms, though it remains moderate,\\" he added. The claimant count fell by 10,100 in December to 797,800. Appropriate scepticism is due, but it looks very much like growth in the labour force, which we have taken for granted for years, has ground slowly to a halt from a peak last July. Within the labour market is another number, more perhaps of political than economic significance. But it is an official statistic and one that those who successfully campaigned for the UK to leave the European Union would point to: where the newly employed people were born. These data were first published in November and are for the July to September period, but are nevertheless worth noting. The number of UK-born people working in the UK rose by 37,000. The number of non-UK born people working in Britain rose by 430,000. Next month we will get the updated numbers for nationality and birth in the workforce and therefore have a better idea of whether it has anything to do with the Brexit vote. Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said the UK labour market remained resilient despite Brexit uncertainty. \\"Employment fell by 9,000 in the three months to November, but this was a much smaller fall than the consensus expectation of a 35,000 drop,\\" he said. \\"And the timelier claimant-count measure of unemployment fell by 10,100, in contrast to expectations of a 5,000 rise. Employment growth should maintain a decent pace in the near term.\\" There were 8.89 million people aged 16 to 64 who were not working and not looking for jobs or available to work - known as economically inactive - for the three months to November. That was 85,000 higher than the June-to-August period, but 63,000 fewer than the three months to November 2015. The jobless rate for the three months to November in Wales stood at 4.4%, 5.1% for Scotland and 5.6% in Northern Ireland. In England the South East had the lowest rate of unemployment at 3.4%, with the North East the highest at 6.8%. London also has a higher rate than the national average at 5.6%. The unemployment figures are based on the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to about 40,000 households, or 100,000 individuals, every three months. As it is a survey, the results are estimates and have a margin of error. For example, the ONS is 95% confident that its estimate of a fall in unemployment of 52,000 is correct to within 81,000. That means we cannot say with 95% confidence that unemployment has fallen at all, so the drop is described as not being statistically significant.

It is located in the Theban necropolis in Upper Egypt, across the River Nile from the modern city of Luxor. The name or at least its French form, Rhamesséion was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls. It was originally called the \\"House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon.\\" Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II. - Amun (also \\"Amon, Amen\\"; Greek \\"Ámmn\\", \\"Hámmn\\") was a major Ancient Egyptian deity.

A child prodigy in philology, he gave his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in 1806, and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles, and spoke Coptic and Arabic fluently. During the early 19th-century French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (17971801) which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of the Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of the hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, and the degree to which the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or ideographic (recording semantic concepts directly). Many thought that the script was only used for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion's decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible to begin to retrieve the many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians. - Senusret I, also anglicized as Sesostris I and Senwosret I, was the second pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. He ruled from 1971 BC to 1926 BC, and was one of the most powerful kings of this Dynasty. He was the son of Amenemhat I and his wife Nefertitanen. His wife and sister was Neferu.

Senusret I was known by his prenomen, Kheperkare, which means \\"the Ka of Re is created.\\" - Nubia is a region along the Nile river located in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. It was one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, with a history that can be traced from at least 2000 B.C. onward (through Nubian monuments and artifacts, as well as written records from Egypt and Rome), and was home to one of the African empires. There were a number of large Nubian kingdoms throughout the Postclassical Era, the last of which collapsed in 1504, when Nubia became divided between Egypt and the Sennar sultanate, resulting in the Arabization of much of the Nubian population.

Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives.

After categorizing the objects, I would determine the most effective storage solutions for each category, considering the available space and any storage equipment (e.g., shelves, cabinets, or bins) already present in the room. 4. Based on the determined storage solutions, I would evaluate the storage room's layout and decide on the best placement of all the objects. This could involve maximizing the use of vertical space, keeping frequently used items within easy reach, and placing heavier items closer to the ground for safety and accessibility reasons. 5. Lastly, I would carefully place all the objects in their designated locations, making sure they are properly stored to avoid damage and are easily accessible when needed.

Weather behaves in a complex and often nonlinear manner, making precise and accurate predictions even for a few weeks in the future highly challenging. While meteorologists and scientists continue to refine their understanding of the intricate interactions between many variables, it remains improbable that we will be able to develop a foolproof method for predicting the weather down to the day, three years from now.

Their ineptitude during basic training antagonizes the drill sergeant and they are assigned to kitchen duties. They misunderstand the cook's instructions and empty the garbage cans into the general's private dining room. The cook, who is thrown in the stockade with them, curses their \\"snitching\\" and threatens them with violence after they are released. They escape his wrath when they are shipped to the trenches in France. Serving close to the front line, they befriend soldier Eddie Smith, who receives a Dear John letter from his wife. When Eddie is killed in action, the boys determine to rescue Eddie's daughter from her brutal foster father and deliver her to Eddie's parents. They distinguish themselves in combat by losing control of a tank and accidentally forcing a German platoon into the open. After the Armistice, Stan and Ollie venture to New York City to retrieve the girl and look for Eddie's parents. Using the city telephone directory, the task proves both monumental and problematic as the boys blindly attempt to visit each Smith until they find the grandparents. After taking punches from an annoyed prizefighter and disrupting a society wedding, they resort to telephoning first. While operating their lunch wagon, the boys are approached by an unpleasant civil servant who demands Eddie's child so that she can be placed in an orphanage. The boys refuse, and the man says he will return with the police to have the boys arrested. They try to secure a loan with their lunch wagon to finance their escape to another city, but the banker smirks that he'd have to be unconscious to make such a deal. While laughing, he topples a bust onto his own head and knocks himself out. Taking this as approval, the boys take what they need from the bank vault. The answer to this question is:","output":"The banker topples a bust onto his own head while laughing at Stan and Ollie's request for a loan to finance their escape to another city."},{"instruction":"What type of details about mojmir i of moravia can be gathered from the following bio?

Then use a solvent such as turpentine or mineral spirits with another clean rag, and blot and clean the stain. Wash the solvent off with warm water, then place the clothes in the laundry as normal.;","output":"Option B outlines an effective way to remove an oil-based paint stain from clothes. Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps to follow: 1. Act quickly: As soon as you notice the stain, it's crucial to act before it dries, as this will make it more difficult to remove. Fresh oil-based paint stains are easier to clean. 2. Blot the stain: Gently blot the stain using a clean paper towel or rag, making sure not to rub it into the fabric. This will help remove any excess paint from the surface of the garment. 3. Prepare the solvent: Choose a suitable solvent such as turpentine, mineral spirits, or white spirit. Make sure to use the recommended solvent for the type of paint used, as it may differ based on the ingredients of the paint. 4. Apply the solvent: Pour a small amount of the solvent onto a fresh, clean rag. Be careful not to soak the rag excessively, as this could damage the fabric. 5. Blot the stain with the solvent: Gently dab the solvent-soaked rag onto the stained area, being cautious not to rub the stain further into the fabric. The solvent will help to dissolve the paint and lift it from the fibers of the clothing. 6. Repeat if necessary: If the stain remains visible after the first attempt, repeat the steps with the solvent until the majority of the paint has been removed. Remember to use a clean section of the rag each time to avoid spreading the stain. 7. Rinse with warm water: Once the stain is mostly gone, rinse the affected area with warm water to remove any remnants of the solvent. This will also help to remove any lingering paint particles. 8. Pre-treat before laundering: Pre-treating the stain with a commercial stain remover or a mixture of liquid dish detergent and warm water can further aid in removing the stain. Gently rub the pre-treatment solution into the stain using a soft brush or your fingers. 9. Wash the garment: Place the garment in the washing machine and launder as you normally would. Be sure to follow the care instructions on the clothing label to avoid any damage to the fabric. 10. Inspect before drying: After washing, examine the stained area to ensure that the paint has been entirely removed. If any traces remain, repeat the pre-treating and laundering process. Avoid drying the garment until the stain is completely gone, as the heat from the dryer can set the paint stain permanently."},{"instruction":"\\"Saidali Iuldachev\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Cai, a senior majoring in electrical engineering at Huan Railway Professional Technology College, originally planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet. During his journey, Cai's idea for a different graduation gift to himself began to take shape. \\"I did not know beforehand what the journey would mean to me.

Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","output":"Bob.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land. - Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs or yabbies, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is running fresh water, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as \\"Procambarus clarkii\\" are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants. - The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world.

It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Parastacidae is the family of freshwater crayfish found in the southern hemisphere . The family is a classic Gondwana - distributed taxon , with extant members in South America , Madagascar , Australia , New Zealand and New Guinea , and extinct taxa also in Antarctica . - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania.

Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it. - Procambarus clarkii is a freshwater crayfish species, native to the Southeastern United States, but found also on other continents, where it is often an invasive pest.

During the time of the restoration, conducted by UkrNIIProektRestavratsiya and headed by Natalia Kosenko, the workers unearthed the whole lower floor, which had been filled in during Soviet times to strengthen the building's foundation. Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Horodecki's original plans.The building was opened as a filial \\"Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art\\" of the National Museum of Arts in November 2004. It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors. In April 2005, the Kiev City Council submitted a bill for 104 million hryvnias (approx. US 20 million) to the Ukrainian Government for reconstruction and restoration of the House with Chimaeras. The Council also allowed the Ukrainian government to construct a new square (closing off all automobile traffic) in front of the building for use in official ceremonies.Since May 2005, the building has been an official presidential residence, used for official and diplomatic ceremonies. The House with Chimaeras was used as a meeting place between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin, when the latter visited Kiev on December 22, 2006.

Here is a hypothesis: Nobody trusts the alley path. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"When analyzing the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, it's important to consider the logical structure, the content, and the context of the statements. In this case, we have a premise stating, \\"Quickest way is down this alley,\\" while the hypothesis states, \\"Nobody trusts the alley path.\\" Let's examine their relationship more closely. First, let's analyze the logical structure of the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is a statement that claims that the fastest route is down this specific alley. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about people's level of trust in the alley path. These two are not directly related in terms of logic, even though they might be related from a content perspective. Now, let's examine the content of the statements. The premise speaks about the efficiency of the alley as a route, which is a characteristic of the alley itself. In contrast, the hypothesis is about people's perception of the alley, specifically, their lack of trust in it. Again, it is not clear that the content of the premise directly indicates the content of the hypothesis. Finally, context plays a critical role in determining whether the premise and hypothesis are related. However, based on the information provided, the context is not clear. Are people aware that the alley path is the quickest way? Do they avoid it for other reasons, such as crime or lack of maintenance? Even so, without any connections between the provided premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to establish a relationship between the given statements. In conclusion, it's not possible to determine that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis because there is no apparent logical or contextual connection between the two statements. The fact that the alley path is the quickest way may have no bearing on whether or not people trust it. It is entirely possible for people to trust the alley path despite it being the quickest way, or for people to distrust the alley path for reasons unrelated to its convenience as a route. Additional information and context could help in more accurately determining any possible relationships between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"If \\"this bearded man looks back in happiness after seeing the graffiti on the wall on the streets of a busy city.\\", does this mean that \\"this bearded man joyously looks back in happiness\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right!

Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain. Q: What produces almost one-half of the earth's oxygen through photosynthesis? Choices: - prokaryotes - algae - arthropods - protists A: Answer:","output":"Protists From the given paragraph, it can be inferred that plant-like protists are responsible for producing almost one-half of the Earth's oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored as glucose or other sugars. Oxygen is a byproduct of this process and is essential for the survival of humans and other aerobic organisms on Earth. Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, including both single-celled and multi-celled life forms. They are not classified under plants, animals, or fungi, but rather belong to their own unique category. Among the various types of protists, the plant-like protists generate significant amounts of oxygen through photosynthesis. These plant-like protists primarily consist of different types of algae, including green algae, red algae, brown algae, and diatoms. Despite the keywords \\"protists\\" and \\"algae\\" both being available as options, it is important to note that algae is a subgroup within the protists, specifically referring to the plant-like protists performing photosynthesis. Although algae do contribute to a significant portion of oxygen production, the correct answer in this context is \\"protists,\\" as it encompasses the entire group of organisms responsible for nearly half of the oxygen production on Earth. In addition, the paragraph also highlights the importance of protists in various aspects of life on Earth, such as decomposing and recycling nutrients and forming a key component of the food chain. This further emphasizes the vital role protists play in maintaining the balance and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Information: - Baden-Württemberg is a state in Germany located in the southwest, east of the Upper Rhine.

As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished. Although she is concerned about his obsession with his dolls, she reluctantly agrees to take the job. She soon meets a traveling salesman, Bob Westley (John Agar), who introduces himself as the best salesman in St. Louis and immediately sets about attempting to seduce her. Their relationship become serious enough that Bob persuades Sally to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz. The next day however, Franz informs Sally that Bob has gone back home to take care of business and that she should forget him. She, however, is unwilling to accept this and goes to the police with a theory about Franz' role in her boyfriend's disappearance (\\"He made Bob into a doll!\\"), but Sergeant Paterson (Jack Kosslyn) is skeptical. Franz has developed a machine which can shrink people down to a sixth of their original size. He then uses it on anyone who tries to leave him. When he finds that Sally plans to quit, she becomes his latest victim. Franz has already miniaturized at least four other \\"friends\\". They are stored in suspended animation (which he has also invented) in glass jars in a display case in his office. After a reunion between Sally and Bob, Franz reveals how the process works and why he miniaturizes people (it seems that he developed a strong phobia against being alone after his wife left him). Periodically, Franz awakens his captives to enjoy parties he throws for them. During a welcoming party for the two newcomers, Franz has to deal with full-size friend and customer Emil (Michael Mark). The prisoners try, but fail to call for help....

He scores 4 touchdowns per game and each touchdown is worth 6 points. There are 15 games in the season. He also manages to score 2 point conversions 6 times during the season. The old record was 300 points during the season. How many points did James beat the old record by? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To determine how many points James scored during the season and how many points he beat the old record by, we'll need to break down all the scoring contributions James made to his team. 1. Touchdowns: James scored 4 touchdowns per game, and each touchdown is worth 6 points. Thus, the points from touchdowns can be calculated as follows: Points from Touchdowns = (Number of touchdowns per game) x (Number of games) x (Points per touchdown) Points from Touchdowns = 4 touchdowns/game x 15 games x 6 points/touchdown Points from Touchdowns = 360 points 2. Two-point conversions: James also scored 2-point conversions 6 times during the season. Each 2-point conversion is worth 2 points. The points from these conversions can be calculated as: Points from Two-point Conversions = (Number of successful 2-point conversions) x (Points per conversion) Points from Two-point Conversions = 6 successful conversions x 2 points/conversion Points from Two-point Conversions = 12 points Now, let's sum up the points from both the touchdowns and the two-point conversions to find the total points James scored during the season: Total Points = Points from Touchdowns + Points from Two-point Conversions Total Points = 360 points + 12 points Total Points = 372 points So, James scored 372 points during the season. The old record was 300 points, so to find out how many points James beat this old record by, we simply subtract the old record from James' total points: Points above the old record = Total Points - Old Record Points above the old record = 372 points - 300 points Points above the old record = 72 points Therefore, James beat the old record by 72 points during the season."},{"instruction":"Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly.

At least some information was obtained on all but 10 schools, most of which are private. Three public schools did not provide contracts; 15 declined to provide the NCAA-mandated outside income report, which covers athletically related income the coach receives from non-university sources. Schools that provided contract information were given the opportunity to review their figures. A 0 means the coach doesn't get compensation from that source or the school did not release the information. University compensation: Base salary; income from contract provisions other than base salary that are paid, or guaranteed, by the university or affiliated organizations, such as a foundation.

Salaries reported do not take into account deductions that have, or may, occur because of state government furlough, or other pay-reduction, actions. Non-university compensation: Income from sources listed on the coach's self-reported athletically related outside income report. Total: Combination of university and non-university compensation. Maximum bonus: The greatest amount that can be received if team meets prescribed on-field performance goals (e.g., win totals, bowl game appearances, conference and/or national championships, coach of the year awards, etc.), academic and/or player conduct goals. Alabama: University compensation includes a 533,333 contract-year completion bonus for the 2009-10 contract year.

Men appear in a field with bulls and the words \\"bullfight laos\\" appear on screen. the men","output":"begin to prepare themselves for a unique spectacle known as the \\"bullfight laos.\\" Originating from the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos), this version of bullfighting, while sharing some similarities, is quite distinct from the Spanish-style bullfighting. Known traditionally as \\"Katong,\\" or \\"Katong Sop,\\" Laotian bullfighting involves the pitting of two bulls against each other, unlike the Spanish version that features a bull versus a matador. Laotian bullfighting is a testament to the culture, tradition, and heritage of this Southeast Asian nation. As the men in the field carefully observe the bulls, they start to assess their qualities - strength, agility, temperament, and overall health. The utmost care is taken while selecting the bulls for the fight, as the chosen animals represent not just the owners' pride but also the symbol of power and prosperity. These bulls are often well-taken care of and are given high-quality food and training to ensure optimal performance in the upcoming event. The men, veterans of laotian bullfighting, initiate the preparations for the spectacle. The bulls are separated and brought into the arena. The designated space for the fight is fenced off to ensure the safety of the spectators and participants alike. The organizers ensure that the event adheres to a certain code of conduct, which is created to maintain the well-being of the bulls and participants. The health and safety of the animals is prioritized, while the essence of the sport remains intact. As the bulls stand in the arena, majestic and powerful, the air becomes thick with anticipation. The crowd begins to gather around the enclosure, eager to witness this unique event. Men, women, and children from all walks of life come together to partake in this spirited and communal occasion. The vibrant atmosphere is punctuated with music playing in the background, while the aroma of traditional Laotian dishes fills the air. With a signal, the bullfight laos begins. The two bulls advance towards each other, locking horns and pushing with all their might. The crowd roars, cheering for their preferred bull and expressing their excitement and enthusiasm. The match goes on for a few intense moments, with both animals showcasing their strength and endurance. In Laotian bullfighting, the objective is not to inflict severe injury or death upon the bulls. Instead, victory is achieved when one bull manages to make the other retreat or overturn it. This practice is rooted in the Laotian belief of respecting their animals and preventing unnecessary harm. Once the victor is declared, both the winning bull and its owner are showered with accolades and rewards. Many times, bets are placed on the outcomes of these events, generating excitement and economic opportunities for the local community. The winning bull is celebrated, symbolizing prosperity and good fortune for its owner and their family. As the crowd disperses and the sun sets on the field, the villagers return to their homes and normal activities with a renewed sense of camaraderie, having gathered around this symbol of their cultural identity. The men and bulls leave the arena, preparing for the next event and carrying forward the rich legacy of this traditional sport. In conclusion, Laotian bullfighting, or \\"Katong Sop,\\" serves as a window into the rich history and vibrant culture of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. With its unique characteristics and methods, it is a testament to the country's fascinating customs and traditions, bringing communities together and celebrating the power and prowess of these noble animals."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: People in Iran used extensive grazing, fell most of their trees so they have lots of problems with desertification. Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, they preserved native species, planted trees and didn't overgraze the land. and a hint : Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes a desert, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.[2] It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming)[3] and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.[4] When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual \\"soil death\\" can be spoken of,[5] which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. Desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem with far reaching consequences on socio-economic and political conditions.[6] Please answer this question : Which country lost fewer bodies of water to desertification? A:","output":"Based on the given situation, Iraq has lost fewer bodies of water to desertification compared to Iran. This is because Iraq has taken a more mindful approach to land use, which includes preserving native species, planting trees, and preventing overgrazing of lands. These actions have contributed to a more sustainable use of natural resources, thus reducing the risk of desertification. On the other hand, Iran did not take the same preventive measures and allowed extensive grazing and deforestation, which has led to numerous problems related to desertification. As desertification typically causes the loss of bodies of water, vegetation, and wildlife, Iran's unsustainable practices have resulted in more bodies of water being lost to desertification. Iraq's approach to land management has helped to maintain healthier ecosystems, protect resources, and promote more sustainable living conditions for its citizens. By implementing responsible land use practices, Iraq has managed to reduce the impact of desertification on its environment, while Iran is currently facing the consequences of its actions. In conclusion, Iraq has lost fewer bodies of water to desertification due to its proactive land use planning and commitment to preserving native species and resources."},{"instruction":"Mick Walter (born Michael E.

Is this product review negative? A:","output":"The product review appears to have both positive and negative aspects to it. It begins by disagreeing with other reviews stating that people often overlook the real purpose of the book. This suggests that the reviewer finds some value in the book that others might not have recognized, which is a positive sentiment. The reviewer then references the back cover of the book, highlighting the claim that the book teaches readers what to focus on for the MCP exam 70-067. By bringing attention to these statements, the reviewer is indicating that the book indeed has a clear purpose aiming to help readers prepare for the exam. However, the negative aspect of the review comes in when the reviewer mentions that the book is a good supplement to a study guide, but does not gauge how well a reader would perform on the exam. This implies that the reviewer believes the book's effectiveness in preparing readers for the exam may be limited or incomplete. Furthermore, the reviewer also notes that the book seems to stay away from realistic exam questions at times, which can be seen as another negative point indicating the book might not be fully representative of the actual exam content. In conclusion, the product review is somewhat mixed in its assessment of the Microsoft Windows NT Server 4 Readiness Review book. It acknowledges the book's potential value as a supplementary resource for exam preparation, but also points out its limitations in accurately gauging a reader's exam performance and addressing realistic exam questions. This combination of both positive and negative insights results in an overall nuanced and balanced review."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man stands holding a string instrument.\\" is it true that \\"The man is holding the instrument for someone.\\"?

Solve -72 = 11*g + 13*g for g.","output":"To find the solution for the given equation -72 = 11g + 13g, we must first combine the terms with the variable g and then isolate the variable (g). 1. Combine like terms: There are two terms containing g (11g and 13g). So, we need to add these terms: 11g + 13g = (11 + 13)g = 24g Now, the equation becomes: -72 = 24g 2. Isolate the variable (g): To find the value of g, we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 24: -72 / 24 = 24g / 24 3. Solve for g: Now, divide -72 by 24: -72 / 24 = -3 So, -3 = g Thus, the value of g for the given equation is: g = -3 The solution to the equation -72 = 11g + 13g is g = -3."},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season.

OPTIONS: - no - yes","output":"Answer: no The response to the question is factually incorrect because the text states that Oriol Romeu made his debut for Barcelona in a league match against Deportivo in May 2010. Jeffren Suarez is mentioned to have made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season, not in 2010."},{"instruction":"The City of Tucson, Pima County, the State of Arizona, and the private sector have all made commitments to create a growing, healthy economy[citation needed] with advanced technology industry sectors as its foundation.

Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the chaos, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet bullet that can kill vampires, and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under the subway.Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires at Kraven's luxurious masnion that sits on the outskirts of the city, but they are more interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight's formal party with the coven from across the 'great ocean' in celebration of the upcoming awakening of Marcus by Amelia, the current reigning Elder. Not interested in their gaities, Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human.

He typically spends 4 minutes washing a car’s windows, 7 minutes washing the car body, 4 minutes cleaning the tires, and 9 minutes waxing the car. This morning he washed 2 normal cars and one big SUV, which took twice as long as a normal car. How many minutes did William spend washing all the vehicles? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break this down step by step for a normal car: 1. Windows: 4 minutes 2. Car body: 7 minutes 3. Tires: 4 minutes 4. Waxing: 9 minutes Total time for a normal car = 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 24 minutes Since the SUV took twice as long as a normal car to wash, we can simply multiply the normal car's washing time by 2: SUV washing time = 24 minutes x 2 = 48 minutes Now, we know that William washed 2 normal cars and 1 SUV. Thus, we need to sum up their washing times: Total time spent = (24 minutes x 2 normal cars) + 48 minutes (SUV) = 48 + 48 = 96 minutes William spent 96 minutes washing all the vehicles."},{"instruction":"Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois as The Chicago Transit Authority before shortening the name in 1970. The self-described \\"rock and roll band with horns\\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Since at least 2008, Billboard has shown Chicago to be the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in singles chart success, and since 2015, the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in album chart success as well. Upon being renamed from Chicago Transit Authority to Chicago, the band sported a new logo. Its inspiration was found in the design of the Coca-Cola logo, in the attitude of the city of Chicago itself, and in the desire to visually transcend the individual identities of the band's members. It was designed by the Art Director of Columbia/CBS Records, John Berg, with each album's graphic art work being done by Nick Fasciano. Berg said, \\"The Chicago logo...was fashioned for me by Nick Fasciano from my sketch.\\" The logo would serve as the band's chief visual icon from Chicago II, onward. In various artistic forms and visual similes, it has been the subject of every subsequent album cover, except the fifteenth album, Greatest Hits, Volume II. For example, it appeared as an American flag on III, a piece of wood on V, a U.S. dollar bill on VI, a leather relief on VII, an embroidered patch on VIII, a chocolate bar on X, a map on XI, a building on 13, a fingerprint on XIV, a computer silicon chip on 16, a parcel on 17, a mosaic on 18, and an aquarelle on 19. Chicago IX's incarnation was a caricature of the band itself, in the shape of the logo. The album cover series has endured as a cataloged work of art in its own right, described by Paul Nini of the American Institute of Graphic Arts as a \\"real landmark in record cover design\\". In 2013, the iconic status of Chicago's album art was featured in a New York art museum exhibit, which centered upon ninety-five album covers completely selected from John Berg's career portfolio of hundreds. Having overseen the design of approximately fourteen Chicago album covers across more than twenty years, Berg stated that this artistic success resulted from the combination of Chicago's \\"unique situation\\" and his position in \\"the best possible job at the best possible time to have that job, at the center of the graphic universe\\". Berg won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Album Package for Chicago X, one of four Grammy Awards he won in his lifetime. The book titled Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design described the logo as \\"a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes in the tradition of sports teams and orange crate labels.\\" The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of Chicago VII as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band's namesake city, quoting the band's original manager, James William Guercio: \\"The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so if you must call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did the fans like the Graphics?","output":"The original text does not directly mention fans' opinions on the graphics. However, considering the long-lasting iconic status of Chicago's album art, which was even featured in a New York art museum exhibit, it can be inferred that fans and the art community appreciated the graphics. Paul Nini of the American Institute of Graphic Arts described the album cover series as a \\"real landmark in record cover design,\\" suggesting that the fans and broader audiences did like the graphics."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Kai asked for Taylor's help on a school project knowing that Taylor enjoys the subject.

How should I read THE HINDU newspaper for improve of vocabulary? How should I read the Hindu newspaper to improve vocabulary? Pick from: * no; * yes;","output":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. They are both asking for guidance on how to read THE HINDU newspaper to enhance one's vocabulary. However, the second question is more grammatically accurate. For a detailed approach to reading the Hindu newspaper to improve vocabulary, consider the following steps: 1. Consistent reading: Make it a habit to read the newspaper on a daily basis. The more exposure you have to diverse content, the more likely you are to encounter new vocabulary. 2. Start with the editorial section: The opinion and editorial sections typically contain well-written articles that showcase rich vocabulary and language usage. Focus on these sections to get started on building your vocabulary. 3. Identify unfamiliar words: While reading the articles, note down words you are not familiar with or do not understand. Keep a dedicated notebook or document for this purpose. 4. Look up definitions and usage: For each of those unfamiliar words, look up their meanings in a dictionary. Observe the context in which they were used in the article to help you better grasp their meaning. 5. Create flashcards: Transfer the new words and their definitions to a set of flashcards, either physical or digital. Including example sentences with the words can also be helpful for reinforcing your understanding of the word's usage. 6. Review the flashcards regularly: Regularly practice your growing set of flashcards, perhaps using a spaced repetition system. The repeated exposure will help strengthen your memory of these new words. 7. Incorporate new words into your writing and speaking: Actively attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary in your daily writing and conversations. This will help solidify your understanding and allow these words to become a permanent part of your vocabulary. 8. Discuss articles with others: Engage in discussions about the content of the articles with friends, family, or fellow learners. This will not only help you to understand the material better but will also allow you to practice using the new vocabulary in context. 9. Set personal goals: Establish goals for your vocabulary improvement journey. It could be learning a certain number of words per week or month, or it could be about incorporating the learned words into your everyday communication by a specific date. 10. Track your progress: Regularly evaluate your improvement in vocabulary. Maintain a record of the words you have learned and periodically attempt to recall and use them in context. By following these steps, reading THE HINDU newspaper can be a highly beneficial tool in expanding your vocabulary and enhancing your language skills."},{"instruction":"Robert: Mom? Where are you?

My main goal was to relax in preparation for the challenges of my retirement in the coming year. Through my stay in Montreal, I met lots of Chinese who are struggling to succeed and then lead a better life in Canada. Some travelled thousands of miles to get knowledge. When I spoke with some of them about the major barrier they had to face after they arrived in Canada, they all talked about the two official languages of Canada. But I was impressed by their ability to express their ideas while switching between English and French. Almost all of those people said they often felt homesick. They miss their families and friends. Though Montreal has lots of Chinese restaurants, they long for a home-cooked meal. I met some tourists who were trying to realize their childhood dreams of experiencing the life in a developed country. When I asked them if Montreal had lived up to their expectations, they hesitated. They said that reality never agrees with fantasies. However, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit Montreal and didn't regret taking the trip. Not all the Chinese people I met were happy. I once met a young lady who met with a gentleman through the Internet. However, to her disappointment, he disappeared after he promised to marry her in Montreal. I was served by another Chinese person who could not handle the challenges of studying in an English environment and ended up working in a restaurant with minimum pay. Exploring different parts of the world, without any doubt, is an enriching experience. However, one should be realistic when it comes to leaving his hometown to set up a new life in a foreign country.

Hyman was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Marie Auerbach, nee Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Russia when he was 13, and the couple owned a delicatessen store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Little Arnold spent his whole childhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playing basketball. In 1941, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the St. Albans School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C. Two years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA. In the 1946-47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49-11 win-loss record, including a standard-setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games. The next year the Capitols went 28-20 but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948-49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38-22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned. After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he \\"felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die\\" and that it was \\"no way to get a job\\". Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949-50 NBA season with a losing record of 28-29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.

Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. and a hint : While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Please answer this question : Which friend received more vaccinations? A:","output":"Based on the information given, it's not possible to say definitively which friend, Nigel or Manny, received more vaccinations. Vaccinations are typically used as a preventive measure against certain diseases, many of which are viral. However, the text doesn't provide specific information on what vaccinations Nigel and Manny may have received in the past. That said, the hint does mention the development of antiviral drugs being driven by the AIDS epidemic. This suggests that Nigel, who is infected with the HIV virus which causes AIDS, might be treated with antiviral drugs, specifically antiretroviral drugs (ART), rather than receiving a vaccination, since there is currently no effective vaccine against HIV. Manny, who has a bacterial infection, would likely be treated with antibiotics rather than a vaccine.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more deforestation occurs happens, how will it affect less air filling the lungs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose is that increased deforestation would lead to less air filling the lungs. While the impact of deforestation on an individual's lung function and the process of respiration may not be direct, several indirect effects could occur that lead to a resultant change. In this case, the increased deforestation might contribute to several changes in the atmosphere and environment that could affect the quality and availability of air for individuals to breathe. 1. Reduction in overall oxygen levels: As plants are major producers of oxygen, through the process of photosynthesis, increased deforestation could lead to a decline in overall oxygen production worldwide. While the global concentration of oxygen would not be immediately affected to a dangerous level due to the massive quantity produced in the world, a long-term result could be a decline in atmospheric oxygen levels. This potentially could lead to less oxygen to be inhaled and thus lesser air filling the lungs. 2. Air pollution: Deforestation, particularly when coupled with human activities like urbanization and industrialization, may lead to an increase in airborne pollutants. These pollutants decrease the overall quality of the available air and, when inhaled, the polluted air could negatively impact lung function. Additionally, these pollutants may also cause inflammation and breathing difficulties, which ultimately result in less air filling the lungs during each inhalation. 3. Climate change: Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change as it increases the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and destroys carbon sinks created by forests. Climate change has been linked to extreme weather events and fluctuations in temperature, which could negatively affect air quality. Furthermore, higher temperatures can exacerbate existing respiratory conditions and make it harder for people to breathe comfortably. As a result, the process of inhaling air may become more difficult, causing less air to fill the lungs. 4. Changes in ecosystems and biodiversity: Deforestation damages ecosystems and can lead to a decline in species diversity. Many plants and microorganisms contribute to air quality by cycling nutrients, producing oxygen, and maintaining humidity levels. The loss of these species could cause a disruption in these natural processes, which could, in turn, lead to a decline in air quality and ultimately impact the air filling the lungs. In summary, while the proposed perturbation of increased deforestation may not directly affect the process of air filling the lungs, it does have several indirect effects on both the environment and the atmosphere. These impacts can lead to changes in air quality, oxygen levels, pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss, all of which could contribute to a decline in lung function and a subsequent reduction in the amount of air filling the lungs."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film is set in a town called Vasco in Goa, named after Alberto Vasco, a Portuguese noble who owned most of the town during the colonial era.

Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Move all terms with m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. 3. Solve for m. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. -309*m + 146*m = -163*m (We combined -309*m and 146*m) -1213*m + 4200 (There are no like terms to combine) The equation is now -163*m = -1213*m + 4200 Step 2: Move all terms with m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To do this, we will add 1213*m to both sides of the equation to move the -1213*m term to the left side. -163*m + 1213*m = -1213*m + 1213*m + 4200 1050*m = 4200 (Since -163*m + 1213*m = 1050*m and -1213*m + 1213*m = 0) The equation is now 1050*m = 4200 Step 3: Solve for m.

They called on the PM to address \\"chronic underfunding\\" in cycling. The Department for Transport said investment had tripled since 2010. Team GB enjoyed a record-breaking Olympics and topped the cycling medal table at Rio 2016 for the third games in a row. Downing Street has since implied there would be \\"no limit\\" to the number of honours given to Olympic heroes. But signatories to the letter - including Mark Cavendish, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Becky James and Sir Chris Hoy - said the best way to mark their achievements would be to invest in cycling. A \\"lack of leadership\\" has kept cycling as a mode of transport \\"in the slow lane\\", they said. Cycling \\"does not enjoy the government investment or political leadership given to roads, rail or aviation,\\" the letter added. \\"Only networks of segregated cycle lanes in towns and cities across the country can achieve and influence growth,\\" it said. The letter called for 5% of the government's transport spending to go on cycling, saying this was the \\"only way\\" to give it \\"the priority it deserves\\". \\"Investment in cycling as a form of transport isn't purely an investment in cycle lanes,\\" it said. \\"It is an investment that will pay off for the nation's health, wealth, transport infrastructure and the vibrancy of our towns and cities. It has the added benefit of just making it easier for ordinary families to get to work and get to school. \\"Our athletes have inspired the country and now we urge the government to take cycling seriously as a transport option for everyone.\\" Chris Boardman, Elinor Barker, Owain Doull and Katy Marchant also signed the letter. Boardman, a former Olympic champion who is now British Cycling's policy advisor, said cycling \\"isn't only a sport\\", but a way for people to get to school and to the shops. He told BBC Radio 5 live the death of his mother - who was killed while cycling in North Wales in July - had made him more determined to campaign for new cycling routes. He described her death as \\"needless\\" and called for \\"protected spaces\\" not mixed in with fast-moving traffic. In March, the government unveiled proposals to encourage people to cycle and walk more in England. The Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy includes the ambition of doubling the number of people using bikes by 2025. The government is now considering feedback on the draft plan. The Department for Transport said it was spending Â£300m on cycling funding - as well as a further Â£500m for infrastructure in local communities. \\"The number of people choosing to get about by bike has grown over recent years and, following the success of our Rio Olympians, we want to see this trend continue,\\" a spokesman said.

Because they didn't want to have a big war over this small problem, they agreed to stay on their sides of the islands and not fight. This situation continued for many years until 1872, when a group of people called a commission decided that the San Juan Islands belonged to the United States. So the conflict ended peacefully, and no one actually went to war over the pig."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Statistics show that there has been a steady decline in the polygamy rate.\\" said in French?","output":"En français, on dirait : \\"Les statistiques montrent qu'il y a eu une diminution régulière du taux de polygamie.\\" Pense à ça comme si je te disais: Les chiffres sur le tableau nous disent que moins de gens sont mariés à plusieurs personnes maintenant."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task you are given a statement and an explanation giving you further knowledge about an entity in the statement.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If less pressure on rocks leads to fewer forest fires, it would affect the chain of events in the process. With fewer fires: 1. Forests won't burn as much, preserving more natural habitats. 2. Animals living in the forest will still have places to hide, avoiding a decline in their population. 3. Predators will not have an easier time finding their prey, maintaining a balanced ecosystem. 4. Birds won't have to fly away from the area, as their homes aren't destroyed by fires. 5. Waters won't warm up as much, allowing fish to thrive in their natural environment.

What is the average weight of the three people, in pounds? Your thoughts:","output":"To find the average weight of Rachel, Jimmy, and Adam, we first need to determine their individual weights. 1. We know that Rachel weighs 75 pounds. 2. Rachel weighs 6 pounds less than Jimmy, so we can say that Jimmy weighs 75 pounds + 6 pounds = 81 pounds. 3. Rachel weighs 15 pounds more than Adam, so we can say that Adam weighs 75 pounds - 15 pounds = 60 pounds. Now that we have their individual weights, we can calculate their average weight: 1. Add their weights together: 75 pounds (Rachel) + 81 pounds (Jimmy) + 60 pounds (Adam) = 216 pounds. 2. Divide the total weight by the number of people (3): 216 pounds ÷ 3 = 72 pounds.

The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category \\"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\\". A recording of \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s. Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin. Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\".

Options: - Sentence A: \\"people say \\"excuse me\\" after being helped\\" - Sentence B: \\"people say \\"thank you\\" after being helped\\" Please answer this question gradually:","output":"To answer this question, let's examine both sentences and determine which one makes more sense in the context of people expressing gratitude or politeness after receiving help. Sentence A: \\"people say 'excuse me' after being helped.\\" - Generally, \\"excuse me\\" is used as a polite expression when someone wants to get someone's attention, ask for permission to pass, or needs to interrupt the conversation. In this context, saying \\"excuse me\\" after being helped doesn't align with the intended purpose of the phrase. Sentence B: \\"people say 'thank you' after being helped.\\" - The phrase \\"thank you\\" is a common expression used to express gratitude or appreciation after someone has assisted or provided help. In this context, saying \\"thank you\\" after being helped makes sense because it fulfills the purpose of acknowledging the assistance received. Comparing the two sentences, Sentence A does not make sense because the phrase \\"excuse me\\" is not typically used to express gratitude after being helped. On the other hand, Sentence B makes sense as \\"thank you\\" is a suitable expression to use after receiving help."},{"instruction":"Read this: This can give rise to the situation in which two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects.

A: The answer is:","output":"Blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) system. Step-by-step justification: 1. Blood calcium levels are an essential aspect of overall body function, as calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction, nerve function, and bone health. 2. To maintain stable levels of calcium in the blood, a regulatory system must exist to ensure that calcium levels remain within a narrow range, preventing issues such as hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) or hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels). 3. One such regulatory system is the parathyroid hormone (PTH) system, which involves the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid glands. 4. The parathyroid glands are four small glands located in the neck behind the thyroid gland. They sense the blood calcium levels and release PTH in response to low blood calcium levels. 5. PTH acts on various target organs, such as the bones (to release stored calcium), the kidneys (to enhance calcium reabsorption), and the intestines (to promote calcium absorption from food). 6. By regulating the release of PTH, the parathyroid hormone system ensures that blood calcium levels are maintained within the necessary range for optimal physiological functioning."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What is the best site for the world's greatest paintings and drawings by famous painters?

This method is convenient and adaptable, allowing for a variety of flavors to be added according to personal preference. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to making homemade instant oatmeal. Materials/Ingredients: - 3 cups of Quick oats - 2 tablespoons of powdered milk, powdered almond milk, or powdered coconut milk - Individual containers (zip-top bags, mason jars, etc.) - Desired additions like nuts, dried fruit, sweetener, and spices Procedure: 1. Gather Your Materials: Collect all the needed materials and ingredients before starting. This includes your oats, powdered milk, and your preferred flavor additions. Quick oats are especially recommended because they will soften quicker when hot water is added. 2. Prepare the Oats: In a large bowl, blend 1 cup of your quick oats until it forms a fine flour. This step aids in the quick absorption of water when rehydrating your instant oatmeal, creating a creamier end result. 3. Combine the Ingredients: After the oats are blended, mix the oat flour with the remaining 2 cups of unblended quick oats in your large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of powdered milk (regular, almond, or coconut) to the oats. This will help make your oatmeal creamier once cooked. 4. Customize Your Oatmeal: This is where you get to add some flavor to your oatmeal. You can add a variety of sweeteners such as sugar, honey, stevia or maple syrup as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice. Consider adding chopped dried fruits like raisins, cranberries, apricots, or nuts like almonds, walnuts or pecans for extra texture and nutrients. Choose your own combinations to suit your taste. 5. Portion the Oatmeal: Divide the oatmeal mixture into individual bags or mason jars. These work great for one or two servings of oatmeal. Each serving should be about half a cup. 6. Prepare the Oatmeal: To prepare your homemade instantaneous oatmeal, simply add your portioned oatmeal mixture to a bowl, heat up 3/4 to 1 cup of water or milk until it's hot but not boiling, and then pouring it over your instantaneous oatmeal. Let it sit until the oats have absorbed all the liquid (about 2-3 minutes), stir, and enjoy. 7. Alternate Cooking Method: If you prefer, you can also cook the oatmeal in the microwave. Place your oatmeal and liquid in a microwave-safe dish, then microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. Make sure to watch carefully to prevent it from boiling over. This method for homemade instant oatmeal is practical because it's just as fast as using store-bought packets but allows for customization to everyone's taste and dietary needs. It also offers a more economical and less wasteful alternative, reducing the need for single-use packaging. This, combined with the ability to make bulk quantities in advance, makes homemade instantaneous oatmeal an excellent option for busy mornings. With this method, you'll have a quick, delicious, and nutritious breakfast ready in no time."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"How was Poland effected by the Crusades?\\" is in \\"With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century).

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic.

They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and British actor and singer Davy Jones. Context: In assigning instruments for purposes of the television show, a dilemma arose as to which of the four would be the drummer. Both Nesmith (a skilled guitarist and bassist) and Tork (who could play several stringed and keyboard instruments) were peripherally familiar with the instrument but both declined to give the drum set a try. Jones knew how to play the drums and tested well enough initially on the instrument, but the producers felt that, behind a drum kit, the camera would exaggerate his short stature and make him virtually hidden from view. Thus, Dolenz (who only knew how to play the guitar) was assigned to become the drummer. Tork taught Dolenz his first few beats on the drums, enough for him to fake his way through filming the pilot, but he was soon taught how to play properly. Thus, the lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist. This, however, is in opposition to the lineup which would have made the most sense based upon the members' musical strengths. For example, Tork was actually a more experienced guitar player than Nesmith, while Nesmith had at one time specifically trained on the bass. While Jones certainly had a strong lead voice and sings lead on several Monkees recordings, Dolenz's voice is regarded, particularly by Nesmith, as one of the most distinctive in popular music history and a hallmark of the Monkees' sound. This theoretical lineup was actually depicted once, in the music video for the band's song \\"Words\\", which shows Jones on drums, Tork playing lead guitar, Nesmith on bass and Dolenz fronting the group. In concert appearances Tork also took much of the guitar duties, even in appearances with Nesmith, and Dolenz often plays rhythm guitar on stage. Unlike most television shows of the time, The Monkees episodes were written with many setups, requiring frequent breaks to prepare the set and cameras for short bursts of filming. Some of the \\"bursts\\" are considered proto-music videos, inasmuch as they were produced to sell the records. The Monkees Tale author Eric Lefcowitz noted that the Monkees were--first and foremost--a video group. The four actors would spend 12-hour days on the set, many of them waiting for the production crew to do their jobs. Noticing that their instruments were left on the set unplugged, the four decided to turn them on and start playing. After working on the set all day, the Monkees (usually Dolenz or Jones) would be called into the recording studio to cut vocal tracks. As the band was essential to this aspect of the recording process, there were few limits on how long they could spend in the recording studio, and the result was an extensive catalogue of unreleased recordings. Question: Did the band become successful on stage? Answer:","output":"Yes, the Monkees did find success on stage, despite the unconventional way in which they were formed and their initial focus on the television show. As the Monkees gained popularity through their TV series, music, and proto-music videos, they began to assert their autonomy as a real band rather than just a manufactured group, eventually playing their own instruments and recording their own songs. The television show's soundtrack albums have initially enjoyed commercial success, which also contributed to the band's overall appeal to the audience. In December 1966, the Monkees embarked on their first live performance, which was a massive success, and from 1967 onwards, their live concerts took place across North America, the United Kingdom, and other countries. These tours helped solidify their reputation as a successful band, as they were able to showcase their genuine musical talents and stage presence to their fans. They played at various venues and attracted huge crowds, proving that their appeal extended beyond the television screen. Despite facing criticisms due to the initial lack of creative input and playing on their records, the Monkees continued to defy expectations and gain credibility as musicians. Over the years, the band members—Dolenz, Nesmith, Tork, and Jones—have matured and developed their skills, with some members enjoying success as solo artists as well. Their live performances demonstrated their ability to work together as a cohesive unit, as they played a mix of their hits and new material. The Monkees have had several reunion tours throughout the years, with the most recent one taking place in 2016, marking their 50th anniversary. These reunions serve as a testament to the enduring legacy and popularity of the band, as their fanbase continues to remain engaged and supportive. Although the Monkees may have begun as an unconventional television project, they eventually carved out a niche of their own, transcending their manufactured image and establishing themselves as successful musicians on stage."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney, Jr. under his pen name of Robert Jordan.

Step 2: Briefly introduce the movie \\"Inception\\" is a 2010 mind-bending science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, and Tom Hardy, among others. Step 3: Discuss the plot and provide a brief summary without spoilers The plot revolves around Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), an experienced thief who specializes in stealing ideas from people's minds through a dream manipulation technology. Cobb's life takes a turn when a mysterious businessman offers him the chance to undo his past mistakes in exchange for a nearly impossible task - to carry out the reverse process of extraction, called inception, and plant an idea into a person's mind. Step 4: Evaluate the film's direction, acting, and technical aspects The direction by Christopher Nolan is top-notch, creating a complex and layered narrative that remains engaging despite its labyrinth-like structure. DiCaprio's portrayal of Cobb is both believable and captivating, contributing to the emotional depth of the film. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, most notably Cotillard as Cobb's deceased wife, Mal. Technically, \\"Inception\\" is a masterpiece, with breathtaking visual effects that bring the dream world to life. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the visuals and storytelling, creating a memorable and immersive experience. Step 5: Analyze the themes and messages \\"Inception\\" explores themes of guilt, regret, reality, and dreams. The film delves into the philosophy of our perception of reality and the power that human imagination and determination can have over our actions and decisions. The message of the movie is open to interpretation, allowing for thought-provoking conversations about the nature of reality, dreams, and the extent to which we can change our lives. Step 6: State personal opinion and provide a recommendation In my opinion, \\"Inception\\" is a cinematic triumph that combines innovative storytelling, convincing performances, and remarkable technical elements to create an unforgettable viewing experience. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves thought-provoking science fiction films and appreciates Christopher Nolan's signature non-linear narrative style. However, for those who prefer straightforward storytelling and simple plots, \\"Inception\\" might be an overwhelming and confusing experience. Step 7: Conclude the review In conclusion, \\"Inception\\" is a modern cinematic gem that brilliantly blends mind-bending visuals with a thought-provoking narrative. Christopher Nolan's direction, together with stellar performances from the cast, make this movie a must-watch for fans of science fiction and psychological thrillers."},{"instruction":"Available options: 1. thermal energy 2. microwaves 3. isotopes 4. electrical signal Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: Solid-state radiation detectors convert ionization produced in a semiconductor (like those found in computer chips) directly into what?

I tried to back up her photos to a drive, but failed. Now do a next sentence writing task. [a]. My wife cooked dinner. [b]. There were too many photos to upload.","output":"[b]. There were too many photos to upload. Understanding that you encountered issues while trying to back up your wife's iPhone photos to the backup drive got me thinking about the possible reasons and potential solutions. Considering that there were around 1200 photos, it's plausible that the backup process was hindered due to the sheer volume of data being transferred. It's not uncommon for backup devices to struggle with large quantities of data, and this might have caused the transfer process to fail. To address this issue and successfully back up the photos, you can follow these steps: 1. Check your backup drive's compatibility: Ensure that the backup drive you purchased is compatible with iPhones and iOS. Some backup devices might only work with specific devices or operating systems, so it's crucial to verify compatibility before proceeding. 2. Update iPhone and backup drive software: Make sure both your wife's iPhone and the backup drive have the latest software updates installed. Outdated software can sometimes cause compatibility or performance issues when transferring data. 3. Charge the devices: Ensure that both the iPhone and the backup device have sufficient battery power before beginning the transfer process, as the process can consume a significant amount of power. 4. Free up space on the iPhone: If your wife's iPhone is almost out of storage space, it might struggle to complete the backup process. Try deleting some unnecessary files or apps to free up storage before attempting the backup again. 5. Transfer photos in smaller batches: Instead of attempting to transfer all 1200 photos at once, divide them into smaller groups (e.g., 300 photos at a time) and back up each batch separately. This can help prevent overwhelming the backup device with too much data at once. 6. Check your internet connection: If the photos are being uploaded to a cloud backup service as part of the process, having a stable and high-speed internet connection is crucial. Slow or unstable connections might cause the transfer to fail. 7. Try a different backup method: If the issue persists despite following the above steps, consider using alternative backup methods, such as an iCloud backup or syncing the photos to a computer. 8. Contact customer support: If all else fails, reach out to the backup drive's customer support team for assistance. They may be able to provide valuable insights into any device-specific issues that might be preventing the photo transfer. By following these steps, you will likely resolve the issue and successfully back up your wife's iPhone photos to the backup drive, preventing any loss of precious memories and freeing up much-needed storage space on her phone."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: For Chinese students nowadays, no matter what kind of schools they are going to universities, high schools and even primary schools, they have to face and tackle the problem of learning English.

It is calledlokahiin the Hawaiian language, which means \\"oneness with all people\\". To enjoy the land you should not be selfish. The land is for everyone who lives on. Today many different people call Hawaii their home. Indeed, Hawaii is a place where people make one big community from many smaller communities. Each person giveskokua(help) to other people so that all feel stronger. It is believed that the islands can be a paradise when people live in peace. People are told that their actions should be as gentle as the wind that blows from the sea. When problems happen, people are asked to solve them with understanding. So when people of Hawaii talk aboutohana(family), they are really talking about all those who live on the island. Living in peace, Hawaiians have developed a third sign of friendship. This personal friendship is shown by givingleisto one another. Thelei, a string of flowers, is put over a friend's neck. Then the friend is given a kiss on the cheek. Visitors to the islands are also givenleis. When they hearaloha, visitors began to feel at home.Alohaalso means \\"goodbye\\", so visitors will hear it again when they leave. It can mean \\"our hearts singing together\\". Perhaps this is how most visitors will remember their new friendship.

Solution:","output":"To complete this task, you need to: 1. Understand the task: The task is asking you to identify the category of a high-school level math question and then solve the problem. There are five possible categories (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, and (5) probability. The task also provides guidelines for identifying each category. 2. Identify the category: The given problem is- \\"Suppose 4*i - 38 = -b, -3*b + 19 = 2*i - 65. Calculate the remainder when b is divided by 7.\\" Looking at the problem, you can see that it contains letter variables (i and b) and asks to find the value of a variable (remainder when b is divided by 7). Based on the guidelines provided, we can conclude that this question belongs to the 'algebra' category. 3. Use the guidelines to find the answer: Since the problem is in the 'algebra' category, follow these steps to solve the problem: a. Solve the system of linear equations: Equation 1: 4*i - 38 = -b Equation 2: -3*b + 19 = 2*i - 65 b. Rearrange Equation 1 to get the value of b: b = 4*i - 38 c. Substitute this value of b in Equation 2: -3*(4*i - 38) + 19 = 2*i - 65 d. Solve this equation to find the value of i: 12*i - 114 + 19 = 2*i - 65 10*i = 68 i = 6.8 e. Substitute the value of i back into the value of b: b = 4*(6.8) - 38 b = 27.2 - 38 b = -10.8 f. Now, find the remainder when b is divided by 7: Since b = -10.8, we can round it to the nearest integer b = -11. When dividing -11 by 7, the remainder is -4. But, since the remainder cannot be negative, we add the divisor (7) to it: Final remainder = -4 + 7 = 3 So, the remainder when b is divided by 7 is 3."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - caps is 18 30 - nationalyears is 2008 -- - youthclubs is far rabat - ntupdate is 14 october 2012 - birth date is 26 march 1986 - clubs is far loan -rrb- '' fus rabat rabat le mans → fc istres '' -lrb- - nationalcaps is 7 - currentclub is fus rabat - caption is brahim el bahri with fath rabat , september 2012 - height is 1.86 - nationalgoals is 2 - nationalteam is morocco - birth place is taounate , morocco - position is midfielder - fullname is brahim el bahri - image size is 230px - years is -2006 2007 -- 2011 2009 -- 2010 2011 -- - youthyears is -2006 - pcupdate is 12 july 2009 - image is brahim el bahri.jpg - goals is 0 4 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

So, no, she never got to see them,\\" Todman said. Morales was about seven months into her pregnancy when she delivered three girls and one boy Thursday, according to Todman. She has been one of the few able to visit the premature newborns and said they are doing well. \\"They're beautiful,\\" Todman said. \\"They have tubes in their mouths and their noses. They've got little monitors and wires all over their body.\\" The infants will likely remain hospitalized for the next two months while doctors help them to get stronger and each reach a goal weight of 5 pounds, Todman said. Currently, they all weigh between just above 2 pounds to just above 3 pounds, she said. Morales was initially hospitalized for high blood pressure. Complications ensued before Morales was taken into surgery, Todman said. She does not know what led to her passing. \\"I don't even care to know,\\" Todman said. \\"It doesn't matter why.

She said Morales tried everything from acupuncture to fertility treatments. Morales suffered a miscarriage before becoming pregnant last June. Todman, who has been best friends with Morales since childhood, said Morales was more nervous about being a new mother than raising four children at once. Because of her previous miscarriage, Morales was apprehensive about getting too excited about the babies' arrival. She mainly focused on doing things correctly throughout her pregnancy such as eating enough, Todman said. \\"Her focus of her pregnancy was to make sure she did everything to make sure they were healthy so she was able to bring them into this world — and she did,\\" Todman said. On Friday, Todman started a GoFundMe fundraising website for Carlos Morales and the infants on Friday.

Movie title: One Eight Seven Movie plot: Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv. Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. CÃ©sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one...

Solve 34 - 1 = 11*h for h.","output":"To solve the equation 34 - 1 = 11*h for h, we will isolate h on one side of the equation. Here is a step-by-step process: 1. The first step is to simplify the numbers on the left side of the equation. In our case, that's 34 - 1. The result is 33. 2. Substitute this result back into the equation. After substituting, the equation becomes 33 = 11*h. 3. The next step is to isolate h, which means we need to get h by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to eliminate 11 from the right side. Since 11 is multiplying h, we do the opposite operation, division, to eliminate it. 4. Divide 33 by 11. The result is 3. 5. Replace h with the result of this division. Hence, h = 3.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Now, I have a new situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Answer this question please: Which farm provided extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn?","output":"The Brown farm provided extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn by choosing to grow cover crops. This decision helped in promoting hyphal growth and creating a more extensive hyphal network, which in turn increased mycorrhizal colonization. As a result, the Brown farm facilitated better growth of AM fungi during autumn, winter, and spring due to the presence of cover crops."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

Ten years later, fighters from so-called Islamic State (IS) seized control of Falluja amid mass protests by local Sunnis against the Shia-led government's sectarian policies. At the end of May 2016, Iraqi security forces and pro-government militiamen closed in on the city, in an attempt to take it back. Falluja, known within Iraq as \\"the city of mosques\\", was religiously conservative before the US-led invasion in March 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. It was one of many places where Islamists moved in when Saddam's Sunni Arab-dominated regime fell and its social control networks were dismantled. Falluja became increasingly hostile to the occupation and US troops were involved in deadly clashes with protesters as early as April 2003. Growing violence over the next year led the US to withdraw its forces from within the city, while former regime loyalists and jihadists were allowed to base themselves there by religious and tribal leaders. In March 2004, four American civilian contractors from the firm Blackwater were killed by gunmen as they drove into the centre of Falluja. Their bodies were later mutilated and burned. One was hung from a bridge over the River Euphrates. Video footage of the attack was broadcast around the world. The US Marines were ordered by then President George W Bush's administration to wrest control of the city and root out insurgents. However, they quickly got bogged down as Falluja residents rose up to defend their city, while the mounting civilian casualties triggered protests and attacks elsewhere in Iraq. Within days, a ceasefire was agreed. The US withdrew its forces to the outskirts of Falluja, which became a stronghold for insurgents, including jihadist militants from al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). That November, some 12,000 US Marine and Army personnel and 2,500 Iraqi troops launched a major assault to drive out the estimated 4,000 rebels believed to be inside the city. The troops gained control of Falluja within a week, although sporadic fighting continued into December. More than 80 US troops were killed in the battle, along with an estimated 2,000 insurgents. Thousands of buildings, including almost 60 of the city's 200 mosques, were also destroyed and most of its 300,000 residents were displaced. Human rights groups accused the US military of using excessive force and condemned its use of white phosphorous munitions. The US argued that its use was legal because civilians, it said, were not targeted. Falluja remained restive in the years that followed, with anger and resentment towards the US occupation building. Reconstruction was slow and doctors also reported high levels of birth defects, with some blaming the weapons used by the US. However, AQI's hold on Falluja was steadily weakened by a US troop \\"surge\\" in 2007 and the creation of Sahwa (Awakening) councils by Sunni Arab tribesmen who rejected its brutality and took up arms to battle the jihadist group. After the withdrawal of US forces in 2011, AQI's successor organisation Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) was able to start rebuilding itself and the number of attacks increased. ISI also joined the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in neighbouring Syria, seizing large swathes of territory, acquiring weaponry and attracting foreign recruits. In 2013, the group renamed itself Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) and exploited a political stand-off between Iraq's Shia-led government and Sunni Arab community, whose members complained that they were being targeted in the name of combating terrorism. In early January 2014, after Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ordered security forces to dismantle protest camps that had existed for more than a year, Isis militants overran Falluja and much of Ramadi with the help of local tribesmen and Saddam loyalists. Six months later, Isis seized control of the second city of Mosul and much of northern and western Iraq. It then declared the creation of a caliphate and changed its name to Islamic State. Iraqi security forces, Shia militias and Sunni tribal fighters besieged Falluja and its suburbs for several months before launching an operation to \\"liberate\\" the city. The UN has expressed serious concern for the safety of the 50,000 civilians estimated to be inside Falluja, who have faced acute shortages of food, medicine and other essential items. The Iraqi military has urged all civilians to leave Falluja and instructed those unable to escape to raise a white flag. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article talks about a city called Falluja, which is in Iraq.

However, it has been difficult because there have been several different groups of bad people in the city. The people who live in Falluja have not been happy with the US and the Iraqi government because their city has been destroyed, and many people have had to leave their homes. Today, the people still living in Falluja face many problems, like not having enough food or medicine. The Iraqi military is trying to help the people by telling them to leave the city or to show a white flag if they need help."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What album cover parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? , can you please find it? The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met...","output":"The album cover that parodied the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is We're Only in It for the Money by The Mothers of Invention."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – Washington state is cracking down on texting and eating at the wheel with a new law that went into effect Sunday. The new “Driving Under the Influence of Electronics” law puts stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in cars, reports the Seattle Times. Even when stopped at a red light or in standstill traffic, drivers can be ticketed for simply holding their phones. The law allows phone usage strictly in emergency situations or with apps that are voice-activated, controlled through dashboards, or mounted for map navigation that requires “minimal use” of fingers. Per USA Today, offenders will be slapped with a 136 fine for first offenses; the penalty increases to 234 for additional offenses within five years. Police will report offenses to insurance companies and they’ll also appear on driving records. Non-electronic distractions like applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap are also restricted as a secondary offense and run a 99 fine. “If I see you speeding and as you speed by me, I see that you're eating a big old cheeseburger, that's a secondary,” Washington State Patrol trooper Will Finn explained to Fox 12 during a ride along, during which he pulled over a driver (who was “shocked” to find out about the law) for speeding while eating an ice cream cone. Finn added that educating drivers is key in the first stages of the law to get to Washington’s Traffic Safety Commission’s \\"Target Zero\\" goal of no deaths on the road by 2030. Per the Times, distracted driving causes a third of road deaths. A spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association says Washington, the first state to ban texting while driving 10 years ago, \\"has the potential to be a game changer and serve as a model for other states.\\" Article:","output":"Washington State Introduces Strict \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" Law Washington state is taking a firm stand against texting, eating, and other non-electronic distractions at the wheel with a new law that went into effect on Sunday. The \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" law imposes stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in vehicles, including the prohibition of holding a phone even while the car is stopped at a red light or in congested traffic. According to the Seattle Times, the new law allows drivers to use their phones only in emergency situations or when operating apps that are voice-activated, controlled through the dashboard, or mounted for map navigation requiring \\"minimal use\\" of fingers.

The law also extends to other distractions not related to electronics, such as applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on the driver's lap.

Washington State Patrol Trooper, Will Finn, highlighted the importance of educating drivers about the law during its initial stages to support Washington's Traffic Safety Commission \\"Target Zero\\" objective of eliminating fatalities on the road by 2030.

First drawback however was upon walking in, there is a very strong seafood smell, which was a little off-putting (but the longer you're in the restaurant, the less you notice the smell). We had a large party, 10+ people, so we were seated in the back party room. The servers were attentive to us and brought us everything we needed. Furthermore, the food was delicious.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.

In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as \\"Coleus\\". Others are grown for seed, such as \\"Salvia hispanica\\" (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as \\"Plectranthus edulis\\", \\"Plectranthus esculentus\\", \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", and \\"Stachys affinis\\" (Chinese artichoke). - In general use, herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or fragrances for their savory or aromatic properties. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. \\"Herbs\\" refer to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while \\"spices\\" are produced from other parts of the plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits. - Chesterfield Islands (\\"îles Chesterfield\\" in French) is a French archipelago of New Caledonia located in the Coral Sea, 550 km northwest of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Polynesia ( from \\"poly\\" \\"many\\" + \\"nsos\\" \\"island\\") is a subregion of Oceania, made up of over 1,000 islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific Ocean.

It is indigenous to Africa, where it is grown for its edible tubers. It is more difficult to cultivate than \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", but able to give greater yields. Although the crop is similar to a potato it is from the mint family but it is still quite nutritious and useful. This crop can benefit many subsistence farmers since it is native, easy to grow, growing popularity in the market and quite nutritious. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

In August 1915, after reading reports about mining operations and tunnelling during the Gallipoli Campaign, along with Professor Ernest Skeats, a professor at the University of Melbourne, David wrote a proposal to Senator George Pearce, the Australian Defence Minister, suggesting that the government raise a military force to undertake mining and tunnelling. After the proposal was accepted, David used his advocacy and organisational abilities to set up the Australian Mining Corps, and on 25 October 1915 he was appointed as a major, at the age of 57. The first contingent of the corps consisted of 1,300 officers and men that were initially organised into two battalions before being reorganised into three tunnelling companies, as well as an electrical and mechanical mining company. After departing Australia for the United Kingdom in February 1916, the corps arrived on the Western Front in May 1916. Given the title 'Geological Adviser to the Controllers of Mines in the First, Second and Third Armies', David became relatively independent and spent his time in geological investigations, using his expertise to advise on the construction of dugouts, trenches, and tunnels, the siting of wells for provision of pure drinking water from underground supplies, giving lectures, and producing maps. In September 1916 he fell to the bottom of a well he was examining, breaking two ribs and rupturing his urethra. He was invalided to London but returned to the Front in November, assuming the role of geological technical advisor to the British Expeditionary Force. On 7 June 1917 his wartime contribution culminated in the mining of German positions in the Battle of Messines. In January 1918, David was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and in November he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The war having concluded, he was demobilised in 1919.

LSD, also known as \\"acid,\\" is a psychedelic drug synthesized from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann while he was researching the potential medical applications of lysergic acid derivatives. It wasn't until 1943 that Hofmann accidentally ingested a small quantity of the substance and discovered its potent hallucinogenic effects. In the 1950s and 1960s, LSD captured the interest of psychiatrists who believed it could be used as a therapeutic tool for treating mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. During the 1960s, the drug gradually gained popularity among counter-culture activists and artists who embraced its mind-expanding abilities as a tool for self-exploration, creativity, and spirituality. People like Timothy Leary, a Harvard psychologist, promoted the use of LSD for its perceived ability to broaden consciousness, gain deeper insights into one's self, and break free from societal norms. This ultimately led to a surge in recreational use among the youth, promoting an anti-establishment attitude that was closely associated with the countercultural movements of the time. The increasing prevalence and visibility of LSD use among American youth alarmed lawmakers and the general public. Media reports at the time often associated the drug with dangerous behaviors and highlighted stories of individuals who had suffered adverse reactions, accidents, or even fatalities as a result of taking LSD. Amid growing concerns over public safety and the potential negative impact of the drug on mental health, the State of California moved to ban the substance in an effort to curb its use and distribution. On 6 October 1966, California became the first state to pass a law making the possession, sale, and manufacture of LSD illegal. This move marked the beginning of a nationwide crackdown on LSD and an increased emphasis on the enforcement of drug laws. Eventually, in 1970, the Controlled Substances Act was passed on a federal level in the United States, classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance. Schedule I drugs are considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and their possession, sale, or manufacture is prohibited under federal law. Ultimately, the prohibition of LSD in California on 6 October 1966 marked a key turning point in the legal and cultural landscape surrounding hallucinogenic substances in the United States. The decision both reflected and contributed to the growing wariness of the drug's potential risks and the tension between counter-cultural movements and mainstream society at the time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who revealed her life story to the police?

Is it true that is the electoral college written in the constitution?","output":"Yes, it is true that the Electoral College is written in the United States Constitution. The Electoral College was initially established through Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution. This original procedure, however, encountered issues during the elections of 1796 and 1800, which led to the introduction of the Twelfth Amendment. The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, refined the process for electing the President and Vice President via the Electoral College. The purpose of the Electoral College was to strike a balance between electing the President and Vice President through a direct popular vote and having Congress directly select these officials. To briefly summarize how the Electoral College works, each state is allotted a certain number of electors that is equal to the combined total of its Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The District of Columbia also has three electors, as provided under the Twenty-Third Amendment. The individuals who are appointed as electors then cast their votes for President and Vice President. The candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes (currently 270 out of 538) is elected President, while the candidate with the second-highest count becomes the Vice President. However, if no candidate achieves the required majority, the House of Representatives selects the President from the top three contenders, with each state delegation receiving one vote. In conclusion, the Electoral College is indeed written in the United States Constitution, initially established in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, and later refined through the Twelfth Amendment. This mechanism plays a crucial role in the presidential election process by providing a balance between a direct popular vote and congressional selection."},{"instruction":"Q:If a person want a changing society, what is a likely motive?

If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Now, I have a new situation: John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged. Answer this question please: Which circuit would push lesser amount of charge through the wire, circuit A or circuit B? A:","output":"To determine which circuit would push a lesser amount of charge through the wire, we can compare the resistance values in Circuit A and Circuit B. We know that Circuit A has adequate resistance while Circuit B has lowered resistance. According to Ohm's Law, Current (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R). When resistance decreases, the current increases. Since Circuit A has higher resistance compared to Circuit B, it will push a lesser amount of charge through the wire. So, Circuit A would push a lesser amount of charge through the wire compared to Circuit B."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss.

Should I validate this answer? Pick your answer from: - No. - Yes.","output":"No. The suggested answer does not address the original question which asked about the life of German immigrants in America. While it correctly states that German Americans are citizens of the United States who were either born in Germany or are of German ancestry, it fails to provide any details regarding their life experiences, living conditions, or the cultural, social, and economic aspects of their assimilation into American society. A more appropriate response would delve into a thorough chronicle of the German immigrant experience, which was significantly varied depending on the time of emigration. For instance, early German immigrants in the late 1600s and 1700s largely included religious refugees from the Palatine region, intellectuals, and artisans. They settled mostly in Pennsylvania and New York and often worked as farmers and craftspeople. They experienced unique challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and sometimes discrimination from the English-speaking majority, but they formed tight-knit communities and contributed significantly to American culture and society. Immigration waves in the 19th century, due to political unrest and economic hardships in Germany, led to a larger population of German immigrants in new territories in the Midwest, and in urban cities like New York and Chicago. Their experiences, again, would vary significantly: some faced anti-German sentiments, while others found success in various industries and made significant contributions to the American way of life. This detailed context about the hardship they faced, the communities they built, the resistances they encountered, and the contributions they made is crucial to understanding the life of immigrant Germans in America.

Mepham High School. His parents divorced when he was five years old (the documentary Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth claims he was eight years old), and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. In 1951, Bruce met his future wife, Honey Harlow, a stripper from Manila, Arkansas. They were married that same year, and Bruce was determined to have her end her work as a stripper. Bruce and Harlow eventually left New York City in 1953 for the West Coast, where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles, California. Bruce then went on to join the bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, which was widely known to be the best burlesque club in Los Angeles at the time. Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work within the San Fernando Valley at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, his job was to introduce the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material. The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: according to Bruce's primary biographer, Albert Goldman, it was \\"precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low\\" that he suddenly broke free of \\"all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school.\\" Honey and Lenny's daughter Kitty Bruce was born in 1955. He had an affair with the jazz singer Annie Ross in the late 1950s. In 1959, Lenny's divorce from Honey was finalized. What other aspects of his personal life are notable?","output":"Other notable aspects of Lenny Bruce's personal life include his tumultuous upbringing, with his parents divorcing when he was five or eight years old—according to the documentary Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth—and leading to him living with various relatives throughout his childhood. His relationship with his British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was distant, as Lenny saw him only infrequently. In 1951, he met Honey Harlow, a stripper from Manila, Arkansas, and they got married the same year. He was determined to have her end her work as a stripper, and together they eventually left New York City for the West Coast in 1953. During their time in Los Angeles, they both pursued careers in entertainment. Lenny Bruce's career trajectory involved performing at strip clubs as the master of ceremonies while working on developing his comedic style. This environment allowed Lenny Bruce to evolve as a comic, ultimately resembling the style and inspiration of his jazz musician friends from the modernist school. Another prominent aspect of Lenny Bruce's personal life was the birth of his daughter, Kitty Bruce, with Honey in 1955. He also had an affair with jazz singer Annie Ross in the late 1950s. Bruce's marriage with Honey Harlow eventually ended in divorce in 1959. Throughout his life, Lenny Bruce's personal experiences and relationships significantly influenced his development as a comedian and the evolution of his thought-provoking and often-controversial material."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have. For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'. Question: It is most probable that idioms will be seen _ . Answer: Select from the following.

Also, get a 50-60mL needleless syringe and 12 inches (30 cm) or so of plastic tubing that matches the size of the valve. Some valves are 6 millimeters while others are 8 millimeters. Either kind is fine, but your plastic tubing should match. Find these syringes at most drug stores. Pick the kind that doesn't have a needle coming out. Look for hot knives at craft stores or home improvement stores. Change the tip on the hot knife to the round tip that's the same size as your valves. Plug the knife in to heat up. Gently pull the plunger back on the syringe about 1 inch (2.5 cm). When the knife is hot, plunge it into the side of the syringe, making a hole in the space you've created by moving the plunger. The exact spot doesn't matter, but place it closer to the tip edge of the syringe than the plunger end. Try to keep the hole as small as possible, as you want the valve to fit in the syringe tightly. Unscrew the black cap off the top of the valve. Turn the threaded part of the valve into the hole. Keep turning it to the right (clockwise) until the valve is as far as it will go in the hole. You'll still have the top part of the valve sticking out of the syringe. At this point, it can help to squeeze a little superglue around the valve, as that will help seal the pump. The length doesn't need to be exact. After you cut it, wedge it onto the tip of the syringe so it fits over it tightly. It can help to add a dollop of superglue around the edges to keep it in place. Push it in as far as it will go. It will eventually hit the lip, and when it does, stop there. You may need to use pliers to help work the valve into the tubing. Some people skip the tubing altogether and just press the valve into the end of the syringe's tip. You can test both options to see which works best for you. Use any length of tubing but make sure it's long enough to reach your pressure chamber. Once it's threaded onto the tubing, attach it to a valve on your pressure chamber to complete the pump. A simple way to make a pressure chamber for your vacuum pump is to drill a hole on the top of a canning jar and insert a bicycle valve thread-side down into the hole. Seal the edges with silicone gel or superglue. To use the vacuum, start with the plunger of the syringe nearly all the way in and then pull it out to the end of the syringe to create a vacuum.","output":"This article describes the process of creating a small vacuum pump with a syringe, bicycle tire valves, and plastic tubing.

SWAT officers shot and killed Vargas after he killed six people in an apartment building in Hialeah, just a few miles north of Miami, ending an hours-long standoff early Saturday, Hialeah Police said. Officials identified the victims as Italo Pisciotti, 79, Camira Pisciotti, 69, Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33, Patricio Simono, 64, Merly S. Niebles, 51, and a 17-year-old female. \\"I'm torn apart by all this,\\" Hialeah mayor Carlos Hernandez said Saturday.

Officials confirmed Vargas started the fire by burning 10,000 cash and his mother was in the apartment complex at the time of the fire. The mother was able to get out to safety, but it is not clear how, according to authorities. Building managers Italo Pisciotti and Camira Pisciotti ran towards the apartment when they noticed smoke was coming out of it and Vargas came out the door, shooting and killing both of them at the scene, Zogby said. Hialeah Shooting Suspect and 6 Victims Dead After Hostage Standoff SWAT officers shot and killed a suspect after he killed six people in an Hialeah apartment building, ending an hours-long standoff early Saturday, Hialeah Police spokesman Carl Zogby said. NBC 6's Bobby Brooks has the latest. (Published Saturday, July 27, 2013) Vargas (pictured right) then ran back into the burning apartment, walked out onto his balcony and fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, killing Gavilanes who was at the apartment building across the street, according to Zogby. He said Gavilanes, a father, had just arrived home from work and was standing in the parking lot next to his car when he was killed. Vargas then ran out of the apartment building, firing shots at random in an irrational fashion, Zogby said. Police officers had already arrived on scene and fired at him as he fired back in the hallway. He then entered another apartment where he took two hostages at gunpoint, Zogby said. Negotiators were talking with Vargas, and police sent a robot into the scene, authorities said. But after police discovered that six people were dead, and that the man had two hostages in an apartment, the SWAT unit decided there was no more time to negotiate, Zogby said. About eight hours after the situation began, a SWAT team entered the apartment, killing Vargas and saving the two hostages. \\"The end result: seven people have lost their lives in this incident, six innocent victims and the one shooter,\\" Zogby said. \\"Now starts the investigation, how and why this happened.” VIDEO: Police Respond to Active Shooter Scene in Hialeah Zogby said the hostages, identified as Zoeb Nek and Sarrida Nek, were not hurt, and he did not believe that any officers were injured. He said Vargas still had several rounds of live ammunition left when police intervened. Officials said he used a 9mm pistol during the rampage. \\"Had we not cornered him and then entered and engaged him, this could have been a much greater tragedy,\\" Zogby said. Hialeah Police told NBC News that Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. Shamira Pisciotti said she found her parents, Italo and Samira Pisciotti, after hearing the shots. She ran over to them and found her mother dead and her father clinging to life. \\"I guess there was an altercation and the person opened fire on both of them. My mom was dead the moment that she was shot and my dad still had a pulse when I got to him,\\" Shamira Pisciotti said. He died soon after, she said. Merly Niebles and husband Patricio Simono, along with Niebles' daughter, were found in one of the apartments, Hialeah police spokesman Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez told NBC News. Agustin Hernandez and Alberto Martinez confirmed Niebles' daughter's name was Priscilla Perez (pictured below). Hernandez and Martinez, who are married to Niebles' sisters, said Patricio was a handyman at the apartment complex and worked with the building managers. American Christian School principal Sergio Chavarri said Perez was a student at his school and would have gone into 11th grade this year. Perez, who wanted to be a nurse, never missed one day of class in the four years that she attended the school which takes pre-K through high school students, he said. \\"She was a very nice person,\\" Chavarri said. \\"We can't believe that such a nice person should be, you know, something like that.\\" Shamira Pisciotti said she believed that there was a complaint about the shooter and that he confronted her parents about it, and that he then shot them. She said she heard about 15 to 20 gunshots. Several other witnesses said they heard between 10 and 12 shots. VIDEO: Daughter of Hialeah Shooting Victim Talks About Finding Her Parents Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes, and a couple of streets in the area were shut down. Claribel Dominguez said she believes she was one of the last people to see her friend Samina Pisciotti alive. She shared that news with Pisciotti's grieving family. “But I was just with her mom before it happened, like 15 or 20 minutes ago before it happened we were at Kmart,” Dominguez said. She said that she heard several shots from inside the store, a few blocks away from the scene. She got a call from Shamira Pisciotti, who told her that her parents had been shot and killed. \\"And I still don't believe it,\\" Dominguez said.

When receiving a gift of any kind, you should absolutely tell the giver “thank you” for it. \\"Thank you\\" is the best response you can offer no matter what you receive. Expressing thanks demonstrates your desire to accept the gift, compliment, or sentiment while still being humble about it. If simply saying \\"thanks\\" feels awkward to you, follow the phrase with a secondary phrase that continues to express gratitude. Try something like, \\"I appreciate the compliment,\\" or, \\"That's very thoughtful of you.\\" Your nonverbal response is just as important as your verbal response. At minimum, you should receive the vast majority of gifts with a smile. Smiling indicates happiness, and the point of any gift is to make the receiver happy. Smiling when you receive something allows the giver to know that the gift was appreciated, regardless of whether the smile is shy and polite or huge and enthusiastic. Aside from smiling, you should also do things like maintaining eye contact and leaning in toward the giver. Even if you feel uncomfortable, you should avoid crossing your arms, looking away, or appearing disinterested. If you have a hard time receiving, your natural reaction might be to deflect or reject a gift that is offered to you. Doing so is actually more likely to cause a negative reaction than receiving the gift would cause, however. Put yourself into the giver's shoes and think of how it feels when someone denies a compliment or suspiciously rejects a gift. Most people will either be saddened when they realize the receiver doesn't know his or her own value, or frustrated by the implication that the gift or sentiment was somehow dishonest. It is also possible, of course, to seem conceited when you receive something. Failing to express genuine gratitude may make you appear egotistical, which can also cause a negative response from the giver. Appearing egotistical can usually be avoided as long as you stick to the standard “thank you” script. You should still avoid following your thanks with words of self-promotion, though. For instance, if someone compliments your appearance, avoid replying with, “Thanks; I get that all the time,” or, “Thanks; I know.” A fair, appropriate way to demonstrate humility when you receive something like a compliment or a reward is to acknowledge others who put you into a position to receive the gift. For instance, if you receive a compliment about a project that was successfully completed as part of a team effort, tell the giver something along the lines of, \\"The entire team put in a lot of effort, and it wouldn't have been possible without everyone's input. Thank you for acknowledging us.\\" Depending on the situation, it might be socially appropriate to follow up with a more formal thanks or return gift. This principle won't always apply, but following it when convention deems it appropriate can help you feel more comfortable with the gift you received. This is a big issue to consider when receiving gifts for formal occasions, like weddings and baby showers. As you receive the gift in person, a quick “thank you” is appropriate. Later on, you should also follow up with a more formal thank you note acknowledging the gift in greater detail. No matter what the circumstances are, you should never turn the practice of giving into a competition. Giving and receiving are two sides of the same action, and there is no shame in being on either side of that action. This can be especially tempting when receiving compliments. If someone compliments your work, don't return the praise by offering higher praise. For instance, you shouldn't reply with, \\"Thank you, but you could've done a better job.\\" Even if you believe such a statement, it is best to accept the praise without argument.","output":"When you receive a gift or a compliment, always say \\"thank you\\" and smile to show your appreciation, avoid appearing disinterested or egotistical, and follow up with a more formal thanks if needed, but never turn giving into a competition."},{"instruction":"Writing in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, clinicians say there is a growing trend for under-25s to seek the wrinkle-smoothing injections. But the research suggests \\"frozen faces\\" could stop young people from learning how to express emotions fully. A leading body of UK plastic surgeons says injecting teenagers for cosmetic reasons is \\"morally wrong\\". Botox and other versions of the toxin work by temporarily paralysing muscles in the upper face to reduce wrinkling when people frown. Nurse practitioner Helen Collier, who carried out the research, says reality TV shows and celebrity culture are driving young people to idealise the \\"inexpressive frozen face.\\" But she points to a well-known psychological theory, the facial feedback hypothesis, that suggests adolescents learn how best to relate to people by mimicking their facial expressions. She says: \\"As a human being our ability to demonstrate a wide range of emotions is very dependent on facial expressions. \\"Emotions such as empathy and sympathy help us to survive and grow into confident and communicative adults.\\" But she warns that a \\"growing generation of blank-faced\\" young people could be harming their ability to correctly convey their feelings. \\"If you wipe those expressions out, this might stunt their emotional and social development,\\" she says. The research calls for practitioners to use assessment tools to decide whether there are clear clinical reasons for Botox treatment. Several assessment scales exist that take into account how thick the skin is, how sun-damaged it appears, and the depth of any wrinkles, but experts warn that some Botox clinics are putting financial gain first. Ms Collier calls on therapists to spend time helping young people boost their confidence rather than reaching for injections. She adds: \\"Though most of the effects of the toxin are temporary, research suggests the muscles don't fully recover from injections. \\"We really need to understand the consequences of starting treatments too soon.\\" Dr Michael Lewis, a researcher in psychology at Cardiff University, says: \\"The expressions we make on our face affect the emotions we feel. \\"We smile because we are happy, but smiling also makes us happy. \\"Treatment with drugs like Botox prevents the patient from being able to make a particular expression and can therefore have an effect on our learning to feel emotions naturally.\\" Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says: \\"Injecting teenagers with Botox for cosmetic purposes is morally wrong and something that no ethical practitioner would do. \\"This can only exacerbate body image issues at a vulnerable time.\\" Ms Collier's research will be presented at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in October.

What instruments are used in Sufi music? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: 1). no. 2). yes.","output":"1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the relationship between the size, shape, and pitch of musical instruments, while the second question is about the specific instruments used in Sufi music. To answer each question: 1. How do the size and shape of a musical instrument affect the pitch? The size and shape of a musical instrument have a significant impact on the pitch (or frequency) produced by the instrument. To understand this relationship, we must first examine the nature of sound. Sound is a vibration that propagates through a medium (such as air, water, or solids) as a mechanical wave. All musical instruments create sound by generating these vibrations, which, in turn, produce different pitches or frequencies. The size and shape of an instrument influence the pitch it generates in several ways: A. Resonance: Resonance involves the amplification of particular frequencies as they travel within an instrument. Shape plays a vital role in determining resonance, as different shapes will favor specific frequencies while dampening others. For example, the curved body of a violin or guitar can enhance a more expansive, rich sound, whereas a flat, wooden box might produce a less desirable, tinny tone. B. Length: Length is a critical determinant in pitch, specifically for instruments where the musician alters the length to produce different notes, such as the trombone, flute, or stringed instruments. The longer the vibrating portion of the instrument, the lower the frequency (lower pitch) it produces. For example, when a trombonist extends the slide, the instrument lengthens, creating a lower pitch. C. Tension: Tension also plays a role in the pitch produced. This factor is most evident in stringed instruments like guitars or violins, where tighter strings create higher frequencies. The shape and size of the instrument can influence that tension, as well as the musician's ability to manipulate it. D. Material: The type of material an instrument is made from can affect the pitch it produces. Denser materials may carry vibrations more effectively, leading to enhanced resonance and increased richness in the instrument's sound. The size and shape of an instrument, in combination with the materials used in its construction, contribute to the uniqueness of each musical instrument's sonic qualities. 2. What instruments are used in Sufi music? Sufi music is a genre of devotional music with roots in the Islamic mysticism of the Sufi tradition. While Sufi music can vary significantly from region to region, some of the most commonly used instruments in Sufi music include: A. Ney (or Nay): The Ney is a long, end-blown flute made from bamboo or cane, and it is one of the primary wind instruments used in Sufi music. The Ney's melancholic, haunting sound is closely associated with Sufi practices and spiritual realms. B. Daf: The Daf is a large, frame drum typically played with the fingers or a beater. It is used in various Middle Eastern and Central Asian musical traditions, including Sufi music. The Daf often provides the steady pulse or rhythm in Sufi music, and its playing style can range from delicate and subtle to energetic and lively. C. Qawwali: Qawwali is a form of devotional music popular in South Asia, particularly in the Sufi tradition. It is characterized by complex vocal arrangements and prominent use of handclaps and percussion instruments like the tabla (a pair of small drums) and the harmonium (a small keyboard instrument). D. Oud: The Oud is a stringed instrument with a short neck and bulbous body, similar to a lute. Its origins are in the Middle East, and its distinctive sound can be heard in various musical styles, including Sufi music. The Oud often provides melodic and harmonic support in Sufi music and can be used for both accompaniment and solo performances. E. Rabab: The Rabab, also known as the rebab or rubab, is a stringed instrument with roots in Central Asia and the Middle East. It features a skin-covered resonator and sympathetic strings, providing a unique sound that can be heard in Sufi music, particularly across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and North India. These are just a few examples of the diverse range of instruments that can be used in Sufi music. It's important to note that Sufi music is not limited to these instruments exclusively; what defines Sufi music is its spiritual message, lyrical content, and the intention behind the performance."},{"instruction":"By. Peter Allen. Alpine tourist meccas which attract thousands of British tourist every year are among the most polluted in France, new research reveals. It shows that Annecy, the beautiful waterside town surrounded by ski slopes, has the second worst air quality in the whole of France. Despite claiming to have ‘Europe’s cleanest lake’, the World Health Organisation (WHO) survey shows its air is full of dangerous fine particles. The cold dry air found in the ski resorts of the Alps (file pic) traps pollution and stops it blowing away. Annemasse, another French town surrounded by dramatic mountainous countryside on the Swiss border, is similarly blighted. The WHO researchers looked at pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the years 2008-2013. Annecy, which is second on the ‘most polluted air’ list for France, has an average 25 microgrammes of so called PM 2.5s - the most dangerous fine particles. They pose a particularly dangerous risk to anyone with breathing conditions including asthma, but also adversely affect everybody else. The reason for the high level of pollution is the cold, dry, Alpine air which traps pollution close to the ground, and stop it being carried away by the wind. However the region is still far behind Delhi, the most polluted city on Earth, which has six times more harmful particles in the air than European cities. The urban sprawl of Geneva is close to Annecy, and there is always masses of traffic carrying people and goods up to the Alpine towns and villages. The most polluted French city on the list was Douai, in northern France, which had 26 microgrammes of fine, harmful particles per units of air. Delhi, the most polluted city in the world, had 153 micrograms per cubic metre of the most harmful particles - making it some six times more polluted than the worst cities in Europe. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article highlights the issue of air pollution in popular Alpine tourist destinations in France, such as Annecy and Annemasse.

The study analyzed pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities across 91 countries from 2008 to 2013. The primary cause of the high pollution levels in these Alpine regions is the presence of cold, dry air that traps pollution near the ground, preventing it from dispersing.

Nevertheless, the increasing air pollution in Alpine tourist areas remains a critical concern due to the heavy influx of tourists and proximity to urban centers like Geneva, which further aggravates the situation. It is important for local authorities and stakeholders to address and mitigate the pollution challenges in these popular tourist destinations to protect both the environment and public health.

Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic. How many years spanned from when the Ottoman arrived to when the war ended?","output":"The Ottoman army arrived on the island during the winter of 1666/1667. The war ended in 1668 according to the text. Therefore, we need to calculate the span of time between these two points. If we consider that the Ottoman army arrived at the end of 1666 or the beginning of 1667 and the war ended in 1668, the time span would be roughly two years, given the information provided. However, this is an approximation as the exact months of the Ottoman's arrival and the war's end are not specified in the text. It could be slightly less than two years or slightly more, depending on these specific dates. Despite this, a span of two years is a fair estimation based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: The acquisition of new generation medium-haul airplanes is also the fundamental condition for the long-term improvement of CSA competitiveness on the air transport market.","output":"Nabytí nové generace střednědobých letadel je také základní podmínkou pro dlouhodobé zlepšení konkurenceschopnosti ČSA na trhu letecké dopravy."},{"instruction":"Question: how is rfid tag powered? Would \\"Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags are powered in one of three ways: passive, active, or semi-passive (also known as semi-active or battery-assisted passive) depending on the RFID tag type. 1. Passive tags: These tags do not have an internal power source. Instead, they draw power from the radio frequency (RF) waves emitted by the RFID reader. When the reader sends a radio signal to the tag, the tag's antenna harvests energy from the signal to power the tag's integrated circuit (IC). This IC processes the data stored in the RFID tag's memory and transmits it back to the reader via backscattering. Passive tags are small, lightweight, and typically have a longer lifespan because they have no internal power source to deplete. 2. Active tags: These tags have their own internal power source, typically a battery. This allows them to be read from much greater distances than passive tags, as they can actively transmit their data to the reader rather than relying on backscattering. In addition to RFID applications that require longer read ranges, active tags are sometimes used when environmental factors, such as metallic or liquid surfaces, might interfere with the operation of passive tags. However, they tend to be larger, more expensive, and have a limited lifespan due to the battery. 3. Semi-passive tags: These tags combine elements of both passive and active tags. They have an internal battery that powers the IC, allowing for more sophisticated functions and processing capabilities. However, they still rely on energy harvested from the reader's radio signal to power the communication with the reader. This means they have a longer read range than passive tags but are still limited compared to active tags. They are typically used in applications that require more functionality than passive tags can provide, but with longer lifespans than active tags. As for the answer, \\"Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses,\\" it is correct that RFID technology can be used for tracking pharmaceuticals in warehouses but it doesn't explain how RFID tags are powered. Pharmaceutical tracking with RFID involves placing tags on the products or their packaging, and installing RFID readers throughout the warehouse. As the tagged items move through the facility, the readers detect the tags and update the tracking information in the inventory management system, facilitating the flow of pharmaceutical products and ensuring their security and traceability."},{"instruction":"Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, the Charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (e.g. me, on all counts) will want to like this movie.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","output":"The question seems to compare the Statue of Unity with the Statue of Liberty and the Lighthouse of Alexandria in terms of similarity or some shared characteristics. Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950), who was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India. The statue is located on an island in the Narmada River in the Indian state of Gujarat and is the world's tallest statue, standing at a height of 182 meters (597 feet). Statue of Liberty, on the other hand, is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor within New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue stands at a height of 93 meters (305 feet) and was dedicated on October 28, 1886. It is a symbol of freedom and democracy. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, was a tall tower built between 280 and 247 BCE on the island of Pharos at Alexandria, Egypt, to serve as a navigational landmark for sailors coming into the city's busy harbor. The lighthouse stood at an estimated height of 100-130 meters (330-430 feet) and was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world for many centuries. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World but was destroyed by earthquakes between the 12th and 15th centuries. In terms of similarity, the Statue of Unity and the Statue of Liberty can be considered more similar, or \\"level,\\" as both are colossal statues representing political or nationalistic ideologies. They both represent real-life historical figures who had a significant impact on shaping their respective countries and share the common function of symbolizing unity and freedom. Furthermore, both statues were built within the last 150 years and are still standing, unlike the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was destroyed centuries ago. On the other hand, the Lighthouse of Alexandria had a different purpose—it served as a navigational aid for sailors in ancient times rather than embodying political symbolism. Also, as an ancient structure, it belonged to a vastly different historical and cultural context compared to the modern statues. In conclusion, the Statue of Unity is hypothetically more 'level' or similar to the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria due to their shared nature as modern monuments representing political symbolism, iconic historical figures, and ideas of freedom and unity."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Test for natural language inference.

The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome.

The primary motivation of this global movement is to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and combat climate change. An up-and-coming technology in the renewable energy sector is the utilization of algae-based biofuels. Algae-based biofuels are a category of renewable sources that use the simple structure and fast growth rate of certain algae species to produce biomass, which can then be converted into biofuels. These biofuels can, in turn, be used as a substitute for fossil fuels to generate energy. Several studies have shown that algae-based biofuels have various advantages over traditional biofuels in terms of CO2 sequestration and reduction of emissions. However, the production processes and potential challenges faced in the scalability of algae-based biofuels are yet to be comprehensively studied and understood. Hypothesis: Algae-based biofuels, if effectively and sustainably produced, can become a potential game-changer in the renewable energy sector by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. This hypothesis anticipates that continued research and development in the field of algae-based biofuels can lead to the discovery of innovative and efficient production techniques, thereby accelerating the adoption of algae biofuels and their contribution to global renewable energy generation."},{"instruction":"Solve 89 + 7 = -318*y + 312*y for y..

Answer the above question based on the context below: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai.

They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. and a hint : Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Please answer this question : Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","output":"Andy is the friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. Andy didn't go to the doctor and as a result, he wasn't prescribed any medications, including the cholesterol drug (a statin) that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. Therefore, his levels of this enzyme remain unchanged. On the other hand, Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication. This would likely have been a statin, which works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Thus, in Ben's case, the levels of this enzyme would have decreased due to the drug. This reasoning process follows from closely reading and understanding the given situation, as well as the relevant hint about cholesterol, statins, and their mechanism of action."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"It has been popular with British and Dutch visitors for many years, and many British people have chosen to become permanent residents.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Zero Brits have chosen to live there permanently.\\" true?

You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4.

Equation weights are given as a list. x = 6, equation weights = [8, 5, 3, 6, 2] A:","output":"To compute the result of the polynomial expression given the value of x and the equation weights, we can use the following steps: 1.

For each weight, calculate the value of the term (weight * x^index) and add it to the 'result' variable. 4. Repeat step 3 for all the weights in the list. 5. Return the final result.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed.

They did this to show that they did not like what Target was doing and wanted them to go back to the way things were before. At first, this might sound a bit strange, but they thought it was the best way to show Target how serious they were. They wanted everyone to know that they thought this was a bad idea. Some people agreed with them and said that they were worried about safety, too. Other people thought it was not fair, and that they should let everyone choose which toilet they felt more comfortable in. In the end, these protests caused many discussions between families, friends, and even on the news. People started talking more about the subject of transgender rights and how to make everyone feel welcome and safe in public spaces. Target stores, on the other hand, continued to let transgender people use the toilets they feel comfortable in. Now you know about this story, it's essential to understand that everyone has different opinions. What matters most is that people listen, learn, and respect each other."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which plants upper petal is divided into two lobes, Ammobium or Westringia? The answer is:","output":"The answer to the elaborate question is Westringia. In Westringia plants, the upper petal is divided into two lobes. Westringia is a genus of Australian shrubs that belong to the family Lamiaceae, commonly known as mint family. These plants are often called 'native rosemary' due to their rosemary-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, tubular flowers. The flowers typically have five petals, with one larger upper petal that is divided into two lobes, giving it a unique appearance. On the other hand, Ammobium is a genus of plants belonging to the family Asteraceae, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family. Ammobium plants produce small, daisy-like flowers and do not exhibit the characteristic of having an upper petal divided into two lobes."},{"instruction":"David wanted to test the theory of Einstein. To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B. He was amazed by the counter intuitive results he got from the experiment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: According to Einstein, would case B perceive the distance shorter or longer than case A?","output":"According to Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, time dilation occurs when an observer is in motion relative to another observer. In this context, the faster an object moves, the slower time appears to pass for that object as observed by a stationary observer. In David's experiment, case A represents the airline pilot who is traveling very fast while case B represents the semi truck driver who is traveling at a slower speed. Since the airline pilot (case A) is moving faster than the semi truck driver (case B), the time dilation effect would be more pronounced for the pilot according to Special Relativity. Now, let's address the question about the perceived distance. According to the length contraction phenomenon, which is another aspect of Special Relativity, the faster an object is moving relative to a stationary observer, the shorter the distance appears to the moving observer. In this case, the airline pilot (case A) is moving faster than the semi-truck driver (case B) relative to a stationary observer, so case A would perceive the distance as being shorter. Therefore, case B (the semi-truck driver) would perceive the distance as being longer compared to case A (the airline pilot)."},{"instruction":"Jenny was a 13 year old girl with blond hair and blue eyes.

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - Operation Market Garden (1725 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War.

Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Nuenen is a town in the municipality of Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten in the Netherlands.

Here are the steps I will follow: 1. Begin with the first part of the sentence, \\"Here are some tips\\": In Spanish, \\"here are\\" can be translated to \\"aquí tienes\\" or \\"aquí hay\\". For this context, it would be more appropriate to use \\"aquí tienes\\". The word \\"some\\" can be translated to \\"algunos\\" or \\"unas\\", depending on the gender of the noun it modifies. In this case, \\"tips\\" (which are feminine in Spanish) should be translated as \\"consejos\\". So, the first part of the sentence becomes: \\"Aquí tienes algunos consejos\\". 2. Translate the next part of the sentence, \\"to help you\\": The verb \\"to help\\" can be translated as \\"ayudar\\", and \\"you\\" as \\"tú\\" when it's used as a subject or \\"te\\" when it's used as an object pronoun. In this case, since \\"you\\" is the object of the verb \\"help\\", it should be translated as \\"te\\". Therefore, the phrase becomes \\"para ayudarte\\". 3. Finally, translate the last part of the sentence, \\"on the journey\\": The preposition \\"on\\" can be translated to \\"en\\" or \\"sobre\\" depending on the context. In this instance, \\"en\\" fits better. \\"The journey\\" can be translated as \\"el viaje\\". So, the last part of the sentence is \\"en el viaje\\". 4.

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of 151 metres (495 ft) near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities.

They made their vows a month ago, but Tamara Ecclestone and new husband Jay Rutland could hardly have expected them to be tested so soon. Barely three days after they arrived back in London after an extended honeymoon, Mr Rutland was robbed at knifepoint. Two men in hoodies allegedly stole Jay Rutland's £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet as he relieved himself in bushes. Honeymoon's over: Tamara Ecclestone and her husband Jay Rutland at Ilford Police Station. The self-styled ‘international playboy’ was left battered and bruised in the attack, which happened in a side street near a garage. Two men in hoodies stole his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet. Mr Rutland, 32, said he was driving home alone from a friend’s house shortly after midnight on Wednesday when his fuel gauge started flashing, so he stopped for petrol at a garage off the A12 in Wanstead, East London. He had gone to relieve himself in some bushes in a secluded corner when he was approached by two men who he claims threatened him before assaulting and robbing him. One produced a knife and demanded cash and valuables, then Mr Rutland was hit in the face and knocked to the ground. During the scuffle one of the attackers dropped his phone. Mr Rutland picked it up and later handed it to police, which helped identify the man. Three people from the petrol station came to help Mr Rutland when they heard his screams and shouts. A close friend of Mr Rutland said: ‘It was a fairly vicious attack and Jay did sustain some mild injuries. He is very bruised and shaken.’ He had cuts to his face and a black eye when he arrived at Ilford police station the day after the robbery, accompanied by 29-year-old Miss Ecclestone. On the night of the attack it is believed. Rutland was driving his £100,000 customised Range Rover, which has his. name emblazoned across the bonnet. Mr Rutland married Miss Ecclestone, the socialite daughter of billionaire Formula One boss Bernie, at a lavish £7million celebration in Cannes last month. Three people from the petrol station came to help Mr Rutland when they heard his screams. Residents who live near the garage said the area was not known for crime and they were shocked at the robbery. One said: ‘I can’t believe something like that would happen. Especially at the garage and on such a busy road. We didn’t hear anything, and it was just a normal night.’ Mr Rutland married Miss Ecclestone, the socialite daughter of billionaire Formula One boss Bernie, at a lavish £7million celebration in Cannes last month.

Assuming that: When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases. The answer to this question is:","output":"If the current increases, it typically means that the resistance is decreasing in an electrical circuit, according to Ohm's Law. Let's dive deeper into the relationship between current, resistance, and voltage to understand this concept further. Ohm's Law is a vital principle in electrical engineering that states the relationship between current (I), voltage (V), and resistance (R) in a circuit. The formula for Ohm's Law is given as: V = I × R Here, V represents voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. From the formula, we can deduce that the relationship between current and resistance is inversely proportional when voltage is kept constant in a circuit. Now, let's consider the scenario you provided - when we add resistors in parallel to each other, the total resistance decreases, and the current increases. In a parallel circuit, resistors can be combined in such a way that the reciprocal of the total resistance (1/R_total) is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances (1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ...). Mathematically, this can be expressed as: 1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ... By adding resistors in parallel, the total effective resistance of the circuit decreases. This results in a higher current flow through the circuit for a given voltage, as per Ohm's Law, which states that the current is directly proportional to the voltage, given a constant resistance. Alternatively, we can also conclude that if the current increases, the resistance must be decreasing, keeping the voltage constant. This is because, as per Ohm's Law, the product of current and resistance should equal the voltage, which remains constant in this case. Hence, when the current increases, the resistance must decrease to maintain this equality. In summary, if the current increases in a circuit, it means that the resistance is decreasing, given that the voltage remains constant. This concept is demonstrated through Ohm's Law and the behavior of resistors in parallel circuits. Moreover, it is essential to remember that these relationships and principles apply under the assumption that voltage remains constant throughout the circuit."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Powerful but very difficult to use Product review: A powerful calculator with lots of capability.

Leadership is as much a question of timing as anything else. The leader must appear on the scene at a moment when people are looking for leadership. And when he comes, he must offer a straightforward and powerful message. Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers who cut through argument, debate and doubt to offer a solution everybody can understand and remember. We have an image of what a leader ought to be. We even recognize the physical signs: leaders may not necessarily be tall, but they must have bigger- than-life, commanding features. We expect our leaders to stand out a little, not to be like ordinary men. Half of President Ford's trouble lay in the fact that, if you closed your eyes for a moment, you couldn't remember his face, figure, or clothes. It also helps for a leader to be able to do something most of us can't. Mao swam the Yangtze River at the age of 72. We want our leaders to be like us but better, special, more so. Yet if they are too different, we reject them. A leader must know how to use power (that's what leadership is about), but he also has to have a way of showing that he does. A leader should know how to appear relaxed and confident. His walk should be firm and purposeful. He should be able to give a good, hearty, belly laugh. Ronald Reagan's career as an actor showed to good effect in the debate with his opponent. He managed to convey the impression that in fact he was the President. A leader rides the waves, moves with the tides, understands the deepest feelings of his people. He cannot make a nation that wants peace at any price go to war, or stop a nation determined to fight from doing so. His purpose must match the national mood. His task is to focus the people's energies and desires, to inspire, to make what people already want seem possible and important to achieve. According to the passage, Reagan succeeded in winning his election largely due to the fact that _ . A) he was once an actor B) he was able to well present himself C) Reagan did much for prefix = st1 /America D) Reagan was a very lucky man The answer is:","output":"B) he was able to well present himself"},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, usually shortened to ZDF, stylized as 2DF since 2001, is a German public-service television broadcaster based in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. It is run as an independent nonprofit institution, which was founded by all federal states of Germany (\\"Bundesländer\\"). ZDF is financed by television licence fees and advertising revenues. - A nature reserve (natural reserve, bioreserve, (natural/nature) preserve or (national/nature) conserve) is a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest, which is reserved and managed for conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research. Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws. - Cousin Island is a small granitic island of the Seychelles, lying west of Praslin. It is a nature reserve protected under Seychelles law as a Special Reserve. It is managed by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization and Partner of BirdLife International, by which it has been identified as an Important Bird Area. - Constantine Walter Benson OBE (England, 2 February 1909 Cambridge, England, 21 September 1982) was a British ornithologist and author of over 350 publications. He is considered the last of a line of British Colonial officials that made significant contributions to ornithology. - A wildlife refuge, also called a wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation or competition; it is a protected area, a geographic territory within which wildlife is protected. - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. - The University of Bristol (abbreviated as Bris. in post-nominal letters, sometimes referred to as Bristol University) is a red brick research university located in Bristol, United Kingdom. It received its royal charter in 1909, and its predecessor institution, University College, Bristol, had been in existence since 1876. - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - The Comoros ('), officially the Union of the Comoros (Comorian: \\"Udzima wa Komori,\\" , '), is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar. Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast. Its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comore. The Union of the Comoros has three official languages Comorian, Arabic and French. The religion of the majority of the population is Islam. - A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax. - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it. - Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London. The first radio broadcast was made on 15 March 1932, and the building was officially opened two months later, on 15 May. The main building is in Art Deco style, with a facing of Portland stone over a steel frame. It is a Grade II* listed building and includes the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience, and lobby that was used as a location for filming the 1998 BBC television series \\"In the Red\\". - Seychelles (; French: ), officially the Republic of Seychelles (Creole: \\"Repiblik Sesel\\"), is an archipelago and country in the Indian Ocean. The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, Réunion (region of France) and Mauritius to the south. With a population of roughly 92,000, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country; however, it does have a larger population than the British overseas territory Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Aldabra is the world's second-largest coral atoll. It is situated in the Aldabra Group of islands in the Indian Ocean that are part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, with a distance of southwest of the capital, Victoria, on Mahé Island. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Mainz is the capital and largest city of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. It was the capital of the Electorate of Mainz at the time of the Holy Roman Empire. In antiquity Mainz was a Roman fort city which commanded the west bank of the Rhine and formed part of the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire; it was founded as a military post by the Romans in the late 1st century BC and became the provincial capital of Germania Superior. The city is located on the river Rhine at its confluence with the Main opposite Wiesbaden, in the western part of the Frankfurt Rhine-Main; in the modern age, Frankfurt shares much of its regional importance. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Malcolm Penny is a British zoologist who is known for his ornithological field work on Aldabra and the Seychelles .

Donald Trump and Stephen Bannon. Photographer: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Read More: Bannon’s Path From Trusted Attack Dog to Toxic Liability Bannon led the evening editorial meeting at Breitbart, where he resumed his role as executive chairman, the website said in a statement. A person who was on the call said Bannon called on the group to \\"hunker down\\" and work like never before to advance conservative causes. According to a person close to Bannon, he met Wednesday with conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies and a major financial supporter of both Trump and Bannon’s efforts. The two mapped out a path ahead for Bannon’s post-White House career and discussed how Trump could get his agenda back on track. The following evening, Mercer and several other major Republican donors had dinner with Trump to share their thinking, and Mercer also had a private meeting with Trump to pledge to redouble his efforts to support Bannon and advance Trump’s agenda. Bannon left the White House earlier Friday, ending a controversial tenure as the administration is engulfed in a storm over the president’s remarks on violence in Virginia. Bannon’s departure was agreed on mutually with new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Bannon’s exit caps a tumultuous four weeks in which a slew of senior officials have announced their departures, including the former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former press secretary Sean Spicer and former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was hired and fired within the space of 11 days. The benchmark S&P 500 Index rallied as much as 0.4 percent, rebounding from its second-biggest drop of 2017, touching its daily high point after the New York Times confirmed Bannon’s departure. But stocks soon receded and the index ended down for the day. Investors interpreted his departure as removing a powerful advocate for a protectionist agenda and direct confrontation with China over trade. Bannon, 63, the chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign and an architect of his election victory, was the leading champion of conservative populism within the administration. He served as a link to the so-called “alt-right” movement and was attuned to the attitudes of the most conservative elements of the president’s base. “Steve played an integral part in the president’s journey to the White House,\\" said former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg. \\"Steve went into the White House and didn’t betray his values, worked every day to advance the agenda that the president was elected on. Trump’s voters may get upset that America’s not being made great again. We’ll find out.” Gorka Endangered Sebastian Gorka, a Bannon ally who previously worked with him at Breitbart News, also may face removal from his post as a counter-terrorism aide to the president, said two people with knowledge of the situation. The possible dismissal of Gorka suggests that Kelly is looking to root out Bannon allies and other officials prone to igniting public firestorms. Last week, Gorka told the BBC it was “simply nonsensical” for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss military matters related to recent provocations by North Korea. He subsequently accused the media of distorting his remarks. Bannon had advocated that the president delve into racial issues and applauded Trump’s widely criticized handling of the Charlottesville situation. The president appeared to press forward with that strategy with a series of tweets Thursday morning decrying the removal of Confederate statues. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California called Bannon’s ouster “welcome news, but it doesn’t disguise where President Trump himself stands on white supremacists and the bigoted beliefs they advance.” “Personnel changes are worthless so long as President Trump continues to advance policies that disgrace our cherished American values,” she added. A person close to Bannon portrayed his departure as unrelated to the backlash against Trump’s comments this week that appeared to confer legitimacy on white supremacists following the violence in Virginia. The person said Bannon had turned in his resignation on Aug. 7 to take effect on Aug. 14. The announcement was delayed following last weekend’s melees in Charlottesville to put distance between those events and his exit, the person said. Bannon, whose relationship with Trump was forged through campaign battles, has been one of the president’s closest advisers, skilled at infighting and cultivating the media. His departure strengthens Kelly, who has sought to better organize a West Wing known for chaos and disorder. Bolsters Cohn The move also will bolster Bannon’s rivals within the administration, including National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and top economic aide Gary Cohn, with whom Bannon frequently clashed over policy. During an interview Sunday with NBC News, McMaster pointedly and repeatedly refused to say whether he could effectively work with Bannon going forward. The American Prospect, a progressive magazine, on Wednesday published an interview with Bannon in which the president’s chief strategist discussed his efforts to undermine fellow Trump aides and seemed to undercut the president on key foreign policy issues. Bannon told the magazine political opponents at the State Department and Pentagon were “wetting themselves” over his plans to root out employees he disagreed with over policy. And despite the president’s threats of a swift military response to provocations from North Korea, Bannon conceded “there’s no military solution here” that wouldn’t result in millions of deaths. Even before the interview, the president signaled Bannon’s fate could be in jeopardy. Asked about Bannon’s job security during a freewheeling press conference Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York, the president was noncommittal. He said Bannon was “not a racist” and was treated unfairly by the press, but contended he “came on very late” to his presidential campaign. There were also signals in recent days that friends of the president were souring on Bannon. Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax Media and a frequent confidant of the president, said earlier this week that Trump was “not getting good advice from the people that are around him” in the aftermath of the president’s comments on the violence in Charlottesville. “Whoever is advising him that now is the time to argue in favor of confederate monuments, is not giving him good advice,” Ruddy said in an interview before Bannon’s ouster. Trump had been considering removing Bannon even in the months before the Charlottesville controversy, frustrated with perceptions that his adviser was the one pulling the strings at the White House. He was angered by a Saturday Night Live sketch that depicted Bannon as the grim reaper, sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office while Trump was given a child’s table. A Time magazine cover labeling Bannon “The Great Manipulator” also hurt his standing, as did his portrayal as a key to the president’s electoral success in a recent book by Bloomberg Businessweek reporter Joshua Green. The president was also frustrated by perceptions that his senior aide was behind leaks to the media. Scaramucci, who was fired last month after less than two weeks on the job, said repeatedly he believed Bannon was a leaker. New Risks But moving Bannon outside the White House raises new risks. Even if he continues to support the president, he may become aggressive in attacking the administration’s more traditional Republican players and policies. He has ample access to funding through his close relationships with Mercer and other major Republican donors. Some in the White House disagreed with the decision to oust Bannon, and argued that the move weakened the president’s ability to translate his ideas into policy. Bannon was the administration’s most effective advocate for delivering on the Trump campaign agenda, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. His removal also will isolate Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser who’s best known for his efforts to curtail immigration, the person argued, and leave Trump more vulnerable than ever to the so-called “globalists” on his team. The official also discounted the notion that Bannon’s removal was a victory for liberals who had long advocated for his dismissal, arguing that his power will only increase once he leaves. Bannon may once again devote his attention to media interests, Ruddy said in an interview on Friday after the departure was announced. “Steve is a media guy,” Ruddy said. “He thrives in it and has done very well in it. I assume he’ll be back in some role at Breitbart and using that as a platform for radio or television.” Kurt Bardella, a Republican communications specialist who worked for Bannon at Breitbart but later denounced him, echoed the view, predicting the strategist would \\"feel liberated\\" by his departure. \\"Now, he will be able to operate openly and freely to inflict as much damage as he possibly can on the ‘globalists’ that remain in the Trump Administration,\\" Bardella said. — With assistance by Gerry Smith, and Jennifer Jacobs ||||| White House strategist Steve Bannon can be seen through the window of Marine One after it landed with he and President Donald Trump aboard on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC in April 2017. Photo credit: Ron Sachs, Pool/Getty Images. With the departure from the White House of strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who helped shape the so-called nationalist-populist program embraced by Donald Trump in his unlikely path to election, a new phase of the Trump presidency begins. Given Trump’s nature, what comes next will hardly be conventional, but it may well be less willfully disruptive—which, to Bannon, had been the point of winning the White House. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon said Friday, shortly after confirming his departure. “We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It’ll be something else. And there’ll be all kinds of fights, and there’ll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.” Bannon says that he will return to the helm of Breitbart, the rambunctious right-wing media enterprise he ran until joining the Trump campaign as chief executive last August. At the time, the campaign was at its nadir, and Trump was trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls by double digits. Although his influence with the president waxed and waned, Bannon’s standing in the Trump circle was always precarious. Among the senior advisers competing with Bannon in trying to shape Trump’s agenda, and his tone, were the president’s daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared. Bannon pointedly voiced criticism of those in the president’s sphere whom he considered to be globalists, or liberals (or both), and the president himself plainly bristled over the early attention that Bannon got from the press (including a Time magazine cover, which is said to have particularly irked Trump). Bannon says that his departure was voluntary, and that he’d planned it to coincide with the one-year anniversary of his joining the Trump campaign as chief executive, on August 14, 2016. “On August 7th , I talked to [Chief of Staff John] Kelly and to the President, and I told them that my resignation would be effective the following Monday, on the 14th,” he said. “I’d always planned on spending one year. General Kelly has brought in a great new system, but I said it would be best. I want to get back to Breitbart.” Bannon says that with the tumult in Charlottesville last weekend, and the political fallout since, Trump, Kelly, and he agreed to delay Bannon’s departure, but that he and Kelly agreed late this week that now was the time for Bannon to leave. Bannon may have resigned, but it was clear from the time that Kelly became chief of staff that Bannon’s remaining time in the West Wing was going to be short. Kelly undertook a study of the West Wing’s operating system, and let it be known that he kept hearing about Bannon as a disruptive force and a source of leaks aimed at undermining his rivals. One of those, with whom Kelly is deeply in sympathy, is National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, who clashed forcefully with Bannon over such policies as strategy for the war in Afghanistan. It is plainly Bannon’s view that his departure is not a defeat for him personally, but for the ideology he’d urged upon the president, as reflected in Trump’s provocative inaugural address—in which he spoke of self-dealing Washington politicians, and their policies that led to the shuttered factories and broken lives of what he called “American carnage.” Bannon co-authored that speech (and privately complained that it had been toned down by West Wing moderates like Ivanka and Jared). “Now, it’s gonna be Trump,” Bannon said. “The path forward on things like economic nationalism and immigration, and his ability to kind of move freely . . . I just think his ability to get anything done—particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, it’s just gonna be that much harder.” Bannon assigns blame for the thwarting of his program on “the West Wing Democrats,” but holds special disdain for the Washington establishment—especially those Republicans who have, he believes, willfully failed to provide Trump with meaningful victories. And, he believes, things are about to get worse for Trump. “There’s about to be a jailbreak of these moderate guys on the Hill”—a stream of Republican dissent, which could become a flood. Bannon says that he once confidently believed in the prospect of success for that version of the Trump presidency he now says is over. Asked what the turning point was, he says, “It’s the Republican establishment. The Republican establishment has no interest in Trump’s success on this. They’re not populists, they’re not nationalists, they had no interest in his program. Zero. It was a half-hearted attempt at Obamacare reform, it was no interest really on the infrastructure, they’ll do a very standard Republican version of taxes. “What Trump ran on—border wall, where is the funding for the border wall, one of his central tenets, where have they been? Have they rallied around the Perdue-Cotton immigration bill? On what element of Trump’s program, besides tax cuts—which is going to be the standard marginal tax cut—where have they rallied to Trump’s cause? They haven’t.” Bannon believes that those who will now try to influence Trump will hope to turn him in a sharply different direction. “I think they’re going to try to moderate him,” he says. “I think he’ll sign a clean debt ceiling, I think you’ll see all this stuff. His natural tendency—and I think you saw it this week on Charlottesville—his actual default position is the position of his base, the position that got him elected. I think you’re going to see a lot of constraints on that. I think it’ll be much more conventional.” But Bannon believes that Trump, with the help of Stephen K. Bannon, has already effected a lasting realignment of American politics. As for himself, Bannon says the fight is just beginning. “I feel jacked up,” he says. “Now I’m free. I’ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‘it’s Bannon the Barbarian.’ I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There’s no doubt. I built a f***ing machine at Breitbart. And now I’m about to go back, knowing what I know, and we’re about to rev that machine up. And rev it up we will do.” Bannon tells The Weekly Standard that he can be more effective without the constraints of the White House. “I can fight better on the outside. I can’t fight too many Democrats on the inside like I can on the outside.” And, he says, Trump encouraged him to take on the Republican establishment. “I said, ‘look, I’ll focus on going after the establishment.’ He said, ‘good, I need that.’ I said, ‘look, I’ll always be here covering for you.’” ||||| Steve Bannon, who previously ran the populist news site before joining President Donald Trump's campaign, left his West Wing post earlier on Friday. Bannon returns to Breitbart News as executive chairman Steve Bannon on Friday returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman, just hours after officially being ousted as White House chief strategist, and even helmed the conservative news site's evening editorial meeting. “The populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today,” said Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. “Breitbart gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda.” Story Continued Below Bannon, who previously ran the populist news site before joining President Donald Trump's campaign, left his White House post after having become increasingly isolated in the West Wing. Breitbart said in its announcement that Bannon had submitted his intention to leave the White House on Aug. 7. Bannon had floated a potential return to the bomb-throwing Breitbart prior to his ouster, and had told colleagues he was looking forward to not having to wear a blazer and long pants. Breitbart News CEO and President Larry Solov touted the reunion in a statement. “Breitbart’s pace of global expansion will only accelerate with Steve back,” Solov said. “The sky’s the limit.” Morning Media Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The return comes amid speculation that Bannon, freed from the confines of the West Wing, will seek to inflict damage against some former colleagues in the Trump White House and return to his firebrand ways at Breitbart. Under assault from several other top Trump aides, Bannon reportedly told friends in recent days that'd he'd grown impatient with the internal constraints of the West Wing, and that he yearned to return to his guerrilla warfare days as an outsider. It was time for \\"Bannon da barbarian,\\" he told friends. And the right-wing site may have already fired its opening salvo to the White House in the new Bannon era. Prior to the unveiling of the Breitbart-Bannon reunion, the site reported Friday that the dismissal of Bannon “may turn out to be the beginning of the end for the Trump administration.” In the article, Breitbart’s editor-at-large, Joel Pollak, says that Trump’s firing of Bannon, whose staunchly nationalist views had led him to frequently clash with other Trump administration officials, could lead his tenure to mirror that of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — a celebrity-turned-populist Republican who Pollak says failed to deliver on grandiose campaign promises. “It may turn out to be the beginning of the end for the Trump administration, the moment Donald Trump became Arnold Schwarzenegger,” Pollak said of Bannon’s departure. Pollak argued that without Bannon’s influence, Trump may veer of course and fail to deliver on the agenda he promised to Republican voters. “With Bannon gone, there is no guarantee that Trump will stick to the plan,” Pollak wrote in a piece published just a few hours after the White House released a statement saying Bannon and White House chief of staff John Kelly had “mutually agreed” to part ways. Earlier Friday, the Breitbart editor seemingly responded to news of Bannon’s ouster with a simple tweet: “#WAR.” Pollak told MSNBC on Friday afternoon that the message was intended as a reassurance to Breitbart readers that their mission would remain unchanged going forward under Trump. But he warned that the White House could risk losing support from its base if Trump sought to recast himself politically. If the president “veers away, if he pulls an Arnold Schwarzenegger and tries to reinvent as a liberal, he will see that support erode very, very quickly and he will struggle politically to make the case for re-election in 2020,” Pollak said. Pressed on whether Bannon and Breitbart intended to go to “war” with the Trump White House, the Breitbart editor left the door open to the possibility. “It really depends on the Trump administration,” Pollak said. “The key to the administration’s success has been and continues to be whether it sticks to the agenda on which Donald Trump ran for president.” In a separate report, however, Breitbart cited an Axios story claiming that Bannon was \\"preparing for war\\" by meeting with the billionaire Mercer family, one of the most prolific-backers of the Republican Party. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Shortly after his departure from the White House, Steve Bannon has returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman, where he promises to \\"crush the opposition.\\" In his first public comments after leaving his role as White House chief strategist, Bannon told Breitbart \\"I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents.\\" He further elaborated on his intentions, saying \\"I built a f***ing machine at Breitbart.

How do I download movies without torrents with subtitles? How do I install subtitles to a downloaded movie?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same. They address two different aspects of the movie-watching experience. Let me explain each question in detail. 1. How do I download movies without torrents with subtitles? This question is about the process of downloading movies without using torrent technology and ensuring that the downloaded movie has subtitles included. Torrents are a popular way to download movies, but they are not the only method. There are several alternative ways to download movies with subtitles: A. Online streaming websites: Many websites allow you to stream movies with subtitles included, which you can download using a video downloader browser extension or software. Examples of such websites include Vudu, Tubi, PopcornFlix, and YouTube. However, I recommend checking the legality and safety of these websites before using them. B. Direct downloads: Some websites offer direct downloads of movies with subtitles. You can find such websites by searching \\"movie name + direct download link with subtitles\\" or using specialized websites like Openload, Mediafire, or Rapidshare. Note that some of these websites may not be legal or safe to use, so use caution. C. Video-on-Demand services: Subscription-based services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu often provide movies with subtitles. These services allow you to download movies for offline viewing, with subtitles included. However, you must have a subscription, which usually involves a monthly fee. D. Legitimate free movie websites: There are some legitimate free movie websites, such as Crackle and The Internet Archive, that offer movies with built-in subtitles. It's essential to ensure the website you use is legal and safe. 2. How do I install (add) subtitles to a downloaded movie? This question addresses the process of adding subtitles to a movie that has already been downloaded, regardless of the method used for downloading. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add subtitles to a downloaded movie: A. Locate and download the subtitle file: Several websites offer subtitle files in various languages for different movies, such as Subscene, Podnapisi, and Opensubtitles. Search for the movie you have downloaded and choose the language you prefer, then download the subtitle file, which will typically be in \\".srt\\" or \\".ass\\" format. B. Ensure the movie and subtitle file names match: To avoid compatibility issues, rename the subtitle file so it matches the movie file name, but keep the original extension (e.g., 'MovieName.srt'). Doing so will help media players like VLC or MPC-HC automatically recognize and load the subtitle file when you play the movie. C. Attach the subtitles to the movie using a media player: You can use a media player like VLC to open the movie and load subtitles manually. After opening the movie, go to 'Subtitles' in the menu, click 'Add Subtitle File,' and locate the file you downloaded earlier. The subtitles should now appear on the movie. D. Embed subtitles permanently to the movie file: If you want the subtitles to be a permanent part of the movie file, you can use video editing software like HandBrake or Adobe Premiere Pro to hardcode the subtitle file onto the video, creating a new video file with subtitles embedded. In conclusion, the first question is focused on downloading movies that already have subtitles, while the second question is about adding subtitles to a movie that has been downloaded without them. They are related but distinct tasks, each with its own specific approach and steps to follow."},{"instruction":"This question has options.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to these two questions can be considered the same, as both questions are seeking guidance on how to make money online. While the first question specifically seeks quick and easy methods, the second question focuses on the best ways. There may be some overlap in the answers, but below are the detailed and long answers for each question to ensure both aspects are covered. Question 1: How can I make money online quickly and easily? 1. Online surveys: You can make money by participating in online surveys that require you to complete a series of questions or provide your opinions on various products or services. Websites like Survey Junkie, Swagbucks, and Vindale Research pay for survey completion. 2.

These platforms usually have quick turnaround times for projects, enabling you to make money fairly easily. 3. Online marketplaces: Websites such as eBay, Amazon, and Etsy can be used to sell products like handmade crafts, second-hand items, or retail goods to an online customer base, which can generate income relatively quickly. 4. Cryptocurrency trading: If you already have some experience with this topic, trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be profitable, especially with the volatile nature of these markets. However, this method can also result in significant losses; therefore, proper research and caution are necessary. 5. Affiliate marketing: You can promote products for companies through affiliate programs, and when a purchase is made through your unique referral link, you earn a commission. Websites like Amazon Associates, ShareASale, and ClickBank offer opportunities for affiliate marketing. 6.

Blogging: If you have a passion for a certain topic, you can start a blog and generate income through advertising, sponsored posts, and affiliate marketing. Creating high-quality content and promoting your blog via social media can lead to a substantial following and regular income. 2. YouTube channel: Creating and publishing videos on YouTube may generate revenue through advertising, sponsorships, and merchandise sales. Many successful YouTubers focus on niches like cooking, gaming, or beauty, and their following grows based on the quality and uniqueness of their content. 3. Online courses: If you have expertise in a particular subject, creating and selling online courses can be lucrative. Platforms like Teachable and Udemy enable you to develop and host courses, which can be promoted through your blog or social media channels. 4. Stock trading and investing: If you have knowledge in finance and economics, stock trading and investing can generate income through dividends and capital gains. Websites like E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, and Robinhood offer online trading platforms to invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. 5. Freelance work: Offering long-term freelance services in areas like writing, graphic design, web development, or marketing can lead to consistent work and higher pay rates as you develop a reputation and portfolio. 6.

Websites like Shopify and WooCommerce can help you establish and run your online store. While the answers provided for both questions have some common methods, the focus and specific suggestions vary slightly based on whether the goal is making money quickly and easily or finding the best approach overall."},{"instruction":"Is the premise \\"Two Army soldiers are training a dog to attack by having one soldier wear a protective arm piece and the other soldier hold the dog's leash.\\" true if \\"Two soldiers are holding a dog on a leash.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Two Army soldiers are training a dog to attack by having one soldier wear a protective arm piece and the other soldier hold the dog's leash.\\" cannot be confirmed as true based on the statement \\"Two soldiers are holding a dog on a leash.\\" While both situations involve two soldiers and a dog on a leash, they provide different levels of specifics. In the first scenario, which is more detailed, the two Army soldiers are explicitly stated to be training the dog for an attack. Moreover, in this situation, the roles of each soldier are well defined - one soldier is wearing a protective arm piece (presumably to serve as a target for the dog's training), while the other soldier is holding the dog's leash (presumably to restrain and control the dog during the training). In contrast, the statement \\"Two soldiers are holding a dog on a leash.\\" is broad and doesn't provide context to ascertain the purpose of their interaction with the dog. They could be training the dog, taking it for a walk, or even just holding it for a fellow soldier. Holding a dog on a leash is a common scenario that could fit into many different contexts, and it does not necessarily indicate that the soldiers are training the dog to attack. In other words, while the second situation could potentially be a part of the first, it is certainly not enough to confirm the premise of the first situation. It would require additional information, such as the observation of a protective arm piece, or the understanding that an attack training session is occurring, to fully confirm the first premise based on the second statement. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that two soldiers holding a dog on a leash are training the dog to attack. They could simply be doing something commonly associated with owning a dog, such as taking it out for a walk or general obedience training. In conclusion, without further information, the premise \\"Two Army soldiers are training a dog to attack by having one soldier wear a protective arm piece and the other soldier hold the dog's leash.\\" cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the statement \\"Two soldiers are holding a dog on a leash.\\""},{"instruction":"Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the digestion process is: Ingestion, which refers to the intake of food through the mouth.

He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia. During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers. While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he do anything significant due to his orientation?","output":"Little Richard did many things due to his orientation that were significant. He wore makeup, like Pancake 31, and had his band members wear makeup too, so they could enter white clubs while performing. He said, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" Little Richard used his orientation to stand out and become famous, saying \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" So, his orientation influenced his appearance, performances, and how he became a famous musician."},{"instruction":"Translate to Turkish: Also in business news: Bulgaria and Greece sign a gas pipeline deal and Turkey's Koc Holding makes the list of the world's largest corporations.
