Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Write an article based on this summary: Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale said her politics were not \\"wildly different\\" from left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who is favourite to win the UK party's contest.","output":"Title: Kezia Dugdale Supports Jeremy Corbyn, Citing Similar Views Introduction Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale has recently expressed that her political views are not too distinct from those of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn. As Corbyn leads the race in the United Kingdom Labour Party elections, Dugdale's statement highlights a growing connection between the two political leaders, despite their differences in positioning on the political spectrum. Step 1: Provide Background on Kezia Dugdale Kezia Dugdale, a prominent figure in Scottish politics, is currently contending for the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party, an affiliate organization of the UK Labour Party. She has been associated with advocating for social justice and equality and has served as the Labour's finance spokesperson. Step 2: Discuss Jeremy Corbyn and his political views Jeremy Corbyn, a well-known socialist, has been serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North since 1983. He is known for his strong anti-austerity stance and advocating for re-nationalization of key industries. His political views lean far-left, and he has gained tremendous support in the current UK Labour leadership contest by attracting a diverse range of supporters from various progressive factions. Step 3: Compare the similarities between Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn Though Kezia Dugdale's politics are not as left-leaning as Corbyn's, the two share common ground when it comes to their core beliefs and values. Both are passionate about social justice, workers' rights, and tackling inequalities. Their combined commitment to these causes helps bridge the gap between their political stances, making their partnership an intriguing development in the Labour party's future. Step 4: Analyze the potential impacts on the Labour party and Scottish Labour As Dugdale and Corbyn align on key issues, their potential partnership could create a strong political alliance within the Labour party. This synergy may attract new supporters and voters, especially in Scotland, where Labour has been struggling for years. Consequently, this partnership could help revive the Scottish Labour Party and generate a fresh wave of enthusiasm among its members. Step 5: Address potential concerns or criticisms Critics may question how effectively Corbyn and Dugdale can navigate the ideological differences between their political preferences. In response, it is important to point out that their mutual focus on social justice, equality, and workers' rights should guide their political decisions and help foster unity among their followers. Conclusion In conclusion, Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale's recent statement of similarity to Jeremy Corbyn highlights the potential for a powerful alliance between the two leaders. By focusing on their shared dedication to social justice and equality, Dugdale and Corbyn may reinvigorate their respective factions within the Labour party and attract widespread support for their progressive vision. Despite the differences in their political leanings, this partnership could provide the much-needed boost to the Scottish Labour Party and possibly reshape the UK's political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From pizza to pasta, Boston's did it well. That's where the good times end.  A few years ago, this place had everything going for it... great food, nice atmosphere, cool staff and they provided a place for me and my friends to play poker tournaments. Then, for some reason the cuntbag that ran the place decided to screw over the company that was hosting the tournament and do poker on their own. The dipshits didn't realize that the 60 - 100 of us that showed up weekly only came because of the company that ran the poker tournaments. And the backlash caused most of us to stop coming there altogether (as many of us went there regularly even on a non poker night).  It had been awhile then since I had been here since I was boycotting it. But, some friends and I were starving and everywhere else was packed, so we thought it might still be good. And it kinda was... the food was still tasty.   First thing I noticed when I walked in was that they changed the interior - getting rid of some sports memorabilia and some walls. It looked more generic. The place was also kinda deserted for a Friday or Saturday night (can't remember which). It seemed like there were as many servers as patrons.   You would think with those odds, we would get amazing service - nope. Our waiter was dirt. He was sweatty and impatient, but he brought us our drinks, took our order and let someone else bring out our food while he spent 40 minutes or so chit chatting about World of Warcraft with his dipshit friend 15 feet away from our table. Meanwhile, we were thirsty as fuck and standing next to our booth staring at him - he occasionally would look over at us, but continue to dismiss us. Nobody else ever came by either.   I ended up having to go up and ask for more drinks and was met with scournful and confused looks as though I had done something wrong. WELL FUCK ME, ASSHOLES - I'M SORRY FOR BEING THIRSTY! DIE!!!  The guy eventually concluded is conversation about leveling up and he came over to hand us our check. Our table was never pre-bussed either (meaning we had to stare at our dirty plates the entire time we were there waiting for drinks and the check).

Select from the following. a). negative b). positive","output":"a). negative The sentiment of the review is negative. While the reviewer mentions that the food is good or delicious, the overall experience is negative due to the issues with the poker tournaments, the change in atmosphere, bad customer service, and unpleasant interactions with the staff.

To isolate g, add 116 to both sides of the equation. This will eliminate the constant term -116 on the right side: 0 + 116 = 29g - 116 + 116 116 = 29g Step 3: Solve for g.

First, make sure the child is sitting comfortably, either in a bathtub with a bit of water or on a chair near the sink, so it's easy to reach their hair. 2. Wet the child's hair with warm water. You can use a cup, your hands, or a gentle shower spray. Warm water feels nice and helps to open up the hair, so it's easier to clean. 3. Now, pour a little bit of tear-free shampoo (about the size of a quarter) into your hand. Rub your hands together to make the shampoo foamy. It's important to use a tear-free shampoo to avoid hurting the child's eyes if some shampoo gets in them. 4. Gently massage the shampoo onto the child's hair, making sure to cover all areas, especially the scalp. This will help get rid of dirt and oils, making the hair nice and clean. 5. Rinse the shampoo out of the child's hair using warm water. You can use a cup or your hands again to pour water over the hair until all the bubbles are gone. Make sure to tell the child to close their eyes or hold a towel above their eyes to keep shampoo out of them. 6. After all the shampoo is rinsed away, it's time to condition the hair. Apply a small amount of tear-free conditioner evenly onto the hair, focusing on the ends. This step helps to make the hair soft and smooth. 7. Rinse the conditioner out of the hair using warm water, just like with the shampoo. Make sure all the conditioner is removed, so the hair feels nice and clean. 8. Finally, use a soft towel to gently squeeze and pat the hair dry. Be sure not to rub roughly with the towel, as it can cause tangles and damage the hair.

Tim Bresnan has leapt to the defence of Matt Prior and insists the wicketkeeper said 'nothing wrong' in the team meeting which allegedly led to Kevin Pietersen's sacking by England. Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a friend of Pietersen, accused Prior of saying 'F*** Flower' in that players' meeting - then accused the gloveman of being a 'hypocrite' and 'stabbing Pietersen in the back'. But Bresnan took to Twitter to say: 'I was in that TEAM meeting and @MattPrior13 said nothing wrong. And only ever has the TEAMs best interests at heart. Undeserved criticism'.

All-rounder Ben Stokes echoed Bresnan's sentiments when he posted: 'Cant believe how much stick @MattPrior13 has got #laughable'. But their former team-mate Graeme Swann says he is 'baffled' by the decision to jettison Pietersen. 'I'll be honest about Kevin Pietersen - myself and several other England players were not exactly members of his fan club during the Textgate scandal of 2012,' Swann wrote in The Sun. 'But I changed my opinion of him once he was reintegrated back into the England team towards the end of that year. 'He made a huge effort to improve his attitude around the dressing room. I saw or heard no issues with him in Australia this winter, his approach was exceptional. 'That's why I was baffled on Tuesday when he was effectively sacked as an England player.' 'Baffled': Graeme Swann says he did not see Pietersen do much wrong Down Under and even Prime Minister David Cameron (right with wife Samatha) had his say on the debate. Prime Minister David Cameron also waded into the row, insisting there is a 'powerful argument' for keeping Pietersen in the side. Speaking. on BBC Radio Lancashire, Cameron said: 'I am an enormous fan of Kevin. Pietersen and I have had some of my most enjoyable times watching him. tonking the ball all over the park. 'His. average is remarkable. It is not often I have a sympathy for Piers. Morgan but I thought he was making quite a powerful argument this. morning on my radio. 'But I will let the England selectors pick the England team, I think I had better stay out of this one.' Hitting out: Matt Prior has blasted accusations from Kevin Pietersen's friend Piers Morgan. Tough time: Prior struggled in Australia and was dropped after the third Test. The. ECB have refused to clarify the details of the fallout from the team meeting because of legal. complications, including confidentially clauses in the Pietersen. settlement. But this version. of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the. Pietersen camp, who maintain that their man was the only player prepared. to tell Flower some home truths. It. also brings some context to the explosive tweets on Wednesday by. broadcaster Morgan, KP’s flag-waver-in-chief, who claimed Prior. told his team-mates at the summit that Flower was ‘behaving like a. headmaster’ and that they were playing in a ‘schoolboy environment’. According to Morgan, Prior added: ‘F*** Flower, this is our team.’ Happier times: Pietersen (left) and Prior celebrate Ashes victory Down Under in 2010. Morgan. further tweeted, after challenging Prior to take legal action if the. accusations were incorrect: ‘You stabbed Pietersen in the back, yet you. agreed with him re Flower’s dictator style. Makes you a flaming. hypocrite. ‘For the record, @MattPrior13 (Prior) led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test.

I said and the way it was meant.’ Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '\\"Re-integration complete. Well played\\".' Ironically,. Prior had acted as peacemaker when Pietersen was left out of the. England team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract. But. the wicketkeeper continued his attack on Morgan by saying: ‘There is no. story here, just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the. team’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to. help the England cricket team. ‘I can hold my head up high in that knowledge!’ Taking a battering: Piers Morgan (right) faces Brett Lee in the nets at the MCG.","output":"This article is about a disagreement between some cricket players.

News article: \\"If Crisis Or War Comes\\" is an update of the \\"If War Comes\\" booklet last released in the 1980s and first produced during the Second World War.      Compiled by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), it details examples of crisis scenarios that could occur in Sweden due to disruptions to IT systems, incidents in the rest of the world, or climate change, explaining how to be best prepared for a possible lack of food, water and communications networks.      The reissue comes against a backdrop of increased tension in the Baltic region in recent years, with fears escalating following Russian military action in Georgia and Ukraine. Other Swedish moves to strengthen defence include troops being permanently stationed on the island of Gotland, and a significant increase to Sweden's defence budget.      \\"In the event of a societal emergency, help will be provided first to those who need it most. The majority must be prepared to cope on their own for some time,\\" the brochure warns ominously, adding that \\"water, food and warmth\\" as well as an ability to obtain information from authorities are the most important things in such a scenario.      The guide provides a checklist of foodstuffs and goods it's useful to have at home just in case, ranging from basic vegetables to long-lasting oat or soy milk, tinned protein like sardines or boiled meat, and items for providing warmth, access to communications, and for storing water.      The booklet also has a checklist to help Swedes be better prepared to cope with misleading information and influence operations, noting that \\"the best protection against false information and hostile propaganda is to critically appraise the source\\" by asking questions like \\"is this factual information or opinion?\\" and \\"who has put this out?\\".

Photo: MSB      \\"We all have a responsibility for our country's safety and preparedness, so it's important for everyone to also have knowledge on how we can contribute if something serious occurs,\\" MSB General Director Dan Eliasson said in a statement.      \\"Sweden is safer than many other countries but threats exist.\\"      It may come as a surprise to learn that everyone living in Sweden has a \\"duty to contribute to total defence,\\" which in practice means anyone aged between 16 and 70 can be asked to assist in various ways in the event of war or threat of war, the booklet explains.      That ranges from conscription to the Armed Forces, to civil conscription to government organizations, or being tasked by the Public Employment Agency with performing work deemed to be of particular importance to Sweden’s overall defence.

Tangible information about how to prepare      The focus of the information is how people can prepare themselves to manage the supply of water, food, heat and communications when public services are not functioning as normal, regardless of the cause. If we are prepared, both individuals and society as a whole will be better able to withstand severe stresses.      Focus areas on the website dinsäkerhet.se      The website dinsäkerhet.se offers more information about the areas described in the brochure. The section Crisis and War contains different focus areas covering topics such as disinformation and how to protect yourself.

The website is also a source of information for those who want to monitor the development and planning of Sweden's total defence.      Why is this information coming out now?      We live in a time in which the consequences of extreme weather, IT attacks and terror attacks may cause a breakdown in the function of public services.

Step 1: Combine like terms 76*m + 180 - 365 - 2247 = 0 First, combine the constants 180, -365, and -2247: 180 - 365 = -185 -185 - 2247 = -2432 Now the equation becomes: 76*m - 2432 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term with m To isolate the term with m, move the constant to the other side of the equation by adding 2432 to both sides: 76*m - 2432 + 2432 = 0 + 2432 This simplifies to: 76*m = 2432 Step 3: Solve for m Now, to find the value of m, divide both sides of the equation by 76: 76*m / 76 = 2432 / 76 This calculation results in the value for m: m = 32 So the solution to the given equation, 76*m + 180 - 365 - 2247 = 0, is m = 32."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the absence of COPD would indirectly impact a step of the process by allowing for better airflow and gas exchange in the lungs, leading to more oxygen entering the bloodstream.  COPD can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs' airways and air sacs (alveoli). This damage can lead to narrowed airways and decreased lung capacity, both of which reduce the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. With healthy lungs (no COPD), the respiratory system would encounter fewer obstructions, allowing for more effective oxygenation of the blood and removal of carbon dioxide.

Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception  of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: When asked to find the larger circle,  _  . - children at 6 got it wrong 79 % of the time with no gray ones around - only adults over 18 got it right 95% of the time with gray ones around - children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around - adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around Answer:","output":"children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who did Jean Richard claim had an alliance around 1263?, using the article: Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Increased levels of distress and anxiety are common during the waiting period of any subsequent pregnancies, posing a significant threat to psychological well-being. However, only limited support and therapy are available for these women, and many are left to cope alone. The Positive Reappraisal Coping Intervention (PRCI) is a novel self-administered supportive technique which has been shown to be effective in patients awaiting the outcome of in vitro fertilisation treatment. The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the PRCI in improving quality of life in the difficult waiting period which women with previous RM endure before an ongoing pregnancy can be confirmed.     METHODS AND ANALYSIS A randomised controlled trial (RCT) feasibility study will establish the viability of conducting a multicentre RCT to definitively test the effects of the PRCI on the psychological well-being of women who have experienced RM during the initial waiting period of a subsequent pregnancy. A second component consists of a qualitative process evaluation exploring the initial experience of pregnancy following repeated miscarriages. Participants (n=50) will be randomised into one of two groups. The PRCI intervention group will receive the PRCI card and weekly questionnaires to assess their psychological well-being during the waiting period of their new pregnancy. The non-intervention group will be asked to complete the same weekly questionnaires. The qualitative process analysis will employ semistructured interviews (n=20) to address relevant aspects of the study objectives.    ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval has been obtained from the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central-Hampshire A. Participating centres have given National Health Service R&D approval. Study findings will be disseminated through peer reviewed journals, national and international conferences and lay user groups.     TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN43571276.

I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were.

Title: Silver Saddle Movie plot: The film opens in a small South Texas bordertown in the 1850s. A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Two related native tribes live thousands of miles away from each other. Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which tribe experienced less ozone depletion?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, the Ana tribe, living near the South Pole in Antarctica, has experienced more ozone depletion compared to the Momu tribe living in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. The primary reason for this is the presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica. The ozone hole is caused by the release of chlorine and bromine gases from anthropogenic sources such as aerosol sprays, coolants, and various other products. These gases are responsible for destroying the ozone layer, which is essential for protecting all life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which can have severe consequences for both human and environmental health. For humans, increased UV radiation exposure leads to a higher incidence of skin cancer and eye cataracts. Additionally, ozone depletion affects the nitrogen cycle, causes the death of plankton, and disrupts oceanic food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be catastrophic for the majority of life on our planet. Although pollutant restrictions have helped slow down the rate of ozone loss, the ozone layer is still at risk. The Ana tribe, living in close proximity to the ozone hole over Antarctica, is likely to experience more significant ozone depletion and its associated negative impacts on health and the environment than the Momu tribe, living far away from the ozone hole in Northern Alaska. In conclusion, the Ana tribe in Antarctica experiences more ozone depletion than the Momu tribe in Northern Alaska due to the presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica and the subsequent destruction of the ozone layer caused by chlorine and bromine gases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.

Background: Eugene Louis Vidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895-1969) and Nina S. Gore (1903-1978). Vidal was born at the West Point cadet hospital because his first lieutenant father was the first aeronautics instructor of the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, \\"who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther\\". In the memoir Palimpsest (1995), Vidal said, \\"My birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening [in 1939]; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.\\" Context: In the multi-volume memoir The Diary of Anais Nin (1931-74), Anais Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir Palimpsest (1995). Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with the actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. Yet, regarding Nin, in the online article \\"Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anais Nin\\" (2013), author Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching Mirages, the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Moreover, he was briefly engaged to the actress Joanne Woodward before she married the actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles.  In 1950, Gore Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his partner for the next 53 years. He said that the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other, \\"It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.\\" In Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself \\"gay\\" because he was not an adjective, adding \\"to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim... . I've said - a thousand times? - in print and on TV, that everyone is bisexual\\".  In an interview with Esquire in 1969, Gore said \\"Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word natural, not normal.\\" Commenting his life's work and his life, he described his style as \\"Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\\"  In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail with age, he sold his Italian villa La Rondinaia (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to Los Angeles. Howard Austen died in November 2003 and in February 2005 his mortal remains were re-buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot that Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are a few more interesting points about this article.

It does not provide any information about the consistency or frequency of the bronzeman being right or wrong. It simply states that, in this particular case, he was right. Hypothesis: \\"Like always, the bronzeman had been wrong yet again.\\" This statement suggests that the bronzeman is perpetually incorrect (\\"like always\\"), and in the latest instance, he has once again made an error or misjudgment. This hypothesis implies a historical pattern of the bronzeman being consistently wrong. Given that the premise and the hypothesis directly oppose one another, it's not possible to draw the conclusion that the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise. The premise, in fact, refutes the hypothesis by stating that the bronzeman was right, whereas the hypothesis claims he was wrong.

Question: As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button. According to the text, it seems that the CCSS  _  .

Step 3: Assess the potential impact of pollution on the health of the birds, which could lead to reduced energy levels or compromised immune systems; these factors could influence their ability to find a mate or reproduce successfully. Step 4: Recognize that pollution could result in loss of habitat due to contamination or destruction, causing the birds to search for alternative locations that might be more difficult to find suitable partners. Step 5: Consider that increased pollution could lead to reduced population sizes, making it less likely for birds to encounter potential mates in their environment.

Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D?  John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease.

In the given scenario, the person is a photographer at a wedding where they come across two well-groomed young men. We can assume the photographer is a woman, based on the mention of the phrase \\"oh mom\\" from the young men. The photographer feels compelled to take a picture of these attractive individuals and, upon doing so, they both react with an expression of mild exasperation or resignation, saying \\"oh mom.\\" The phrase \\"oh mom\\" is a telling clue, indicating the close relationship between the young men and the photographer. It is likely that she is their mother because referring to someone as 'mom' in this context – with the young men showing mild irritation at their mother's insistence to take a picture – allows us to conclude that they have a familial bond. While (2). Complete strangers, (3). Her brothers, and (4). Love interests are potential answers, they don't have a strong basis for being the correct response. Complete strangers would not usually refer to someone as their mom, even jokingly, in a situation like this, and the photographer would probably have mentioned if they were her brothers or love interests.

Movie plot title: The Omega Man Movie plot: In 1975, biological warfare between China and Russia kills most of the world's population. U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body. Neville and Lisa return to Neville's apartment where they begin treating Lisa's brother Richie, who is succumbing to the disease. Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening...

Please write a short summary for the following article: U.S. General to Seek Combat Troops if Airstrikes Can’t Stop ISIS Comments by Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on the United States’ campaign against ISIS were interrupted by anti-war protesters. WASHINGTON — Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress on Tuesday that he would recommend deploying United States combat forces against Islamic extremists in specific operations if the current strategy of airstrikes was not successful, offering a more expansive view of the American role in the ground war than that of President Obama. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said that while he was confident in the ability of the coalition of American, European and Middle Eastern governments to stop the Islamic State, he could not completely close the door to eventually asking Mr. Obama to commit ground troops to fight the group, known as ISIS or ISIL. “My view at this point is that this coalition is the appropriate way forward. I believe that will prove true,” he said. “But if it fails to be true, and if there are threats to the United States, then I of course would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.” With oil revenues, arms and organization, the jihadist group controls vast stretches of Syria and Iraq and aspires to statehood. Any future commitment of American personnel on the ground could put Mr. Obama in a difficult position, as he has repeatedly insisted that no American troops would engage in the battlefield, and Gen. Dempsey sought to explain the apparent contradiction. “His stated policy is that we will not have U.S. forces in ground combat,” General Dempsey said, adding, “He has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.” In his speech last week announcing the expanded campaign against Islamic State, Mr. Obama said the military advisers he was sending to Iraq would help Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence, and equipment. But he emphatically ruled out front-line fighting. “These American forces will not have a combat mission — we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq,” he said. But as General Dempsey made it clear, the reality of the battle might make such a hands-off approach insufficient. When Iraqi or Kurdish forces are trying to dislodge militants from urban areas like Mosul, airstrikes are less effective because they can cause civilian casualties. In those cases, the general said, he might recommend to the president that the United States send Special Operations troops to provide what he called “close combat advising,” essentially working alongside Iraqi commanders in the field and helping them direct troops to targets. In fact, General Dempsey said the commander of the military’s Central Command, Gen. Lloyd Austin, had recommended deploying American spotters for airstrikes for the complex campaign to retake the Mosul Dam from Islamic State. Mr. Obama, however, rejected the proposal. General Dempsey and the secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel, were on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to provide up-to-date information on the administration’s plan for confronting the militant group. They said the plan would include the training and equipping of 5,000 Syrian fighters, the involvement of more than 40 coalition nations, including 30 that have pledged military support, and 1,600 American military personnel who will assist. But members of the committee sounded far from convinced that the plan would succeed. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he doubted that 5,000 Syrian fighters — who could not be trained for months — would be able to fight off more than 30,000 Islamic State combatants. “To many of us that seems like an inadequate response,” Mr. McCain said. Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who votes with Democrats, said he was concerned about what appeared to be a “whack-a-mole” approach. Mr. Hagel and General Dempsey took pains to portray the military campaign as a broad coalition-led fight. “This is ultimately their fight,” Mr. Hagel said, referring to the Middle Eastern countries that are most immediately threatened by the militant group. They also stressed that this campaign would be nothing like the 2003 invasion of Iraq. “This won’t look like a ‘shock-and-awe campaign’ because that’s not how ISIL is organized,” General Dempsey said. While the two men attempted to play down the scope of the American military’s involvement, General Dempsey did acknowledge the open-ended and unpredictable nature of the fight ahead. “Truly there is no military solution to ISIL,” he said, adding that it could be defeated only with a more comprehensive approach that includes diplomacy. “That may be a tough pill to swallow. But there is no military solution.”","output":"Gen. Martin E.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Spores are dispersed into the air by a mature mushroom - The spores fall to the ground - The spores germinate - The spores begin to grow mycelium - The mycelium begin to sprout a bud The answer is:","output":"The final step of the process after the mycelium begins to sprout a bud is the formation and maturation of the fruiting body, also known as the development of a new mushroom. To elaborate, the process of mushroom reproduction and growth can be broken down into several steps: 1. Spore dispersal: Mature mushrooms release their spores into the air to increase the chances of reproduction. Depending on the species, this dispersal can be aided by wind currents, rain, or even insects and animals. 2. Spore landing and germination: Once the spores land on a suitable substrate, such as soil, decaying organic matter, or even living host organisms, they begin to germinate. This stage depends on various factors like temperature, humidity, and the presence of a suitable food source. 3. Mycelium growth: The germinated spores give rise to thread-like structures called hyphae, which collectively form the mycelium—the vegetative part of a fungus. The mycelium extracts nutrients from its surroundings and grows, expanding its network. 4. Bud formation: When environmental and nutritional conditions are optimal, certain species of fungi begin to form dense clusters of mycelium called primordia. Primordia develop into small buds, which will eventually develop into mushrooms. The final step – Formation and maturation of the fruiting body: The buds that form on the mycelium undergo a process of cell differentiation, ultimately giving rise to a mature fruiting body—a fully developed mushroom. This fruiting body, which is the reproductive structure of the fungus, usually consists of a cap and a stalk. At maturity, the mushroom's gills, pores, or other spore-producing structures release new spores to continue the reproductive cycle. It is essential to note that the entire process can vary in duration according to the species of mushroom, specific environmental conditions, and other factors. Some mushrooms may develop within a few days, while others might take weeks or even months to complete their life cycle. The process of mushroom growth and development is a fascinating example of the adaptation and resilience of fungi in diverse ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first use of the gallows after the moratorium was the hanging of Westley Allan Dodd in Washington on January 5, 1993. The first use of lethal injection was on December 7, 1982, when Charles Brooks, Jr., was executed in Texas. How was Charles Brooks, Jr. executed? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Charles Brooks, Jr. was executed by lethal injection on December 7, 1982, in Texas. This was the first use of lethal injection as a method of execution in the United States. Lethal injection involves administering a series of drugs to the condemned individual, usually through an intravenous line, which ultimately leads to the person's death. The process for Brooks's execution started by securing him to a gurney in the execution chamber, where medical professionals inserted two intravenous (IV) lines into his arms. These IV lines were connected to a series of drugs that would eventually be administered in a specific order. The execution team was located in an adjacent room, where they controlled the flow of the drugs into the IV lines. The lethal injection process typically involves three drugs, although the specific drugs and sequence have changed over the years. At the time of Charles Brooks, Jr.'s execution, the three-drug protocol included sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. 1. Sodium thiopental: This is a fast-acting barbiturate that is used as an anesthetic. Once administered, sodium thiopental causes the inmate to lose consciousness rapidly. This drug is intended to ensure that the person being executed does not experience pain during the process. 2. Pancuronium bromide: This drug is a paralytic agent that, once introduced into the inmate's system, causes paralysis of the skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm. As a result, the individual is unable to breathe, leading to suffocation. However, since the first drug is supposed to have rendered the person unconscious, they should not experience any distress during this stage. 3. Potassium chloride: This drug is the final component of the lethal injection process. Potassium chloride acts by stopping the heart and inducing cardiac arrest. The rapid influx of potassium causes an imbalance in the electrolyte concentrations within the cells, disrupting the normal functioning of the heart muscle and ultimately resulting in death. After the three drugs were administered to Charles Brooks, Jr., his death was confirmed by medical personnel, marking the end of the first execution by lethal injection in the United States."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: A Christmas Carol Context: In a prologue, Ebenezer Scrooge (Patrick Stewart) buries his business partner, Jacob Marley, in a rural churchyard. The funeral is poorly attended. Time is shown passing (as the sign outside Scrooge's business grows rusty). It is Christmas Eve, and Scrooge's nephew, Fred, visits the counting house to wish his uncle a merry Christmas. Scrooge believes Fred's marriage is unsuitable, and they argue about it. Fred departs, and two gentlemen arrive seeking donations for the poor. Scrooge denounces such charitable efforts, and the men depart. Scrooge agrees to give his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Richard E. Grant), the day off on Christmas but demands that Cratchit arrive \\"all the earlier\\" the following day (December 26). Scrooge arrives at his home and has visions of Jacob Marley's face appearing in his door knocker and the tiles around his fireplace. Marley's ghost (Bernard Lloyd) appears and convinces Scrooge of his supernatural nature. Marley tells Scrooge that the uncharitable are tormented after death, and he has come to warn Scrooge as well as tell him that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts over the next three nights. The ghosts will try to convince Scrooge to reform. At midnight, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Joel Grey). They visit Ebenezer Scrooge as a child, who is forced to spend his holidays at school due to his father's rejection. Scrooge's sister, Fran, arrives to tell Scrooge he is welcome at home again. The ghost then takes Scrooge to the business of his mentor, Albert Fezziwig (Ian McNeice). A young Scrooge (Kenny Doughty) is shown enjoying Fezziwig's Christmas party, and his romance with a young girl, Belle (Laura Fraser), is introduced. The ghost then shows Belle breaking off her engagement to Scrooge because Scrooge has become obsessed with money. The ghost takes Scrooge home, and in anger Scrooge snuffs out the spirit's light. Scrooge wakes in bed, thinking it is 2 A.M. on the following night. A light from the next room draws him toward the Ghost of Christmas Present...

Which is the best summary of this article?","output":"The article primarily reports on the financial performance of Gateway, a public limited company listed on NYSE, for the quarter that ended in September. Gateway successfully performed better than expected by Wall Street analysts, as it not only managed to minimize its losses but, impressively, also exceeded the market's projected bottom-line figures for this time period. The company's progress, evidenced by its financial results, is notable since they managed to substantially decrease their losses. Thus, this may be viewed positively by investors and stakeholders who consider such financial reports while taking decisions. Additionally, no other business activities, strategic plans, or market initiatives undertaken by Gateway during this period are mentioned in the article; which suggests the focus is purely on the firm's financial improvement. Therefore, the overall tone of the article appears to be optimistic with regards to Gateway's financial performance and the company's ability to exceed Wall Street's expectations. However, specific financial figures, such as revenue and profit margins, are not disclosed, making it challenging to gauge the exact degree of the company's accomplishment or the real magnitude of the reduction of its losses. In conclusion, this article indicates a positive trend in Gateway's financial health, capable of influencing investor sentiment positively. Given these points, the best summary of this article would be: \\"Tech company Gateway has reportedly decreased its losses and surpassed Wall Street's financial forecasts for the September quarter. Specific financial details were not disclosed, but the company's ability to outperform expectations and minimize losses point to notable financial improvements.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples? Answer:","output":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples.  Candied ginger is made by cooking ginger root in a sugar syrup, which significantly increases its sugar content compared to its fresh form. The process of candying not only sweetens the ginger but also helps preserve it by creating a sugar coating around the root. On the other hand, fresh apples contain natural sugar, but their sugar content is considerably lower than that of candied ginger. Apples also contain fiber and various vitamins and minerals, making them a healthier option than candied ginger when considering overall nutritional value. In summary, candied ginger has a higher sugar content compared to fresh apples due to the additional sugar added during the candying process."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the information you found on Google is correct. Poison dart frogs, belonging to the family Dendrobatidae, are native to Central and South America. To provide a more detailed answer, these colorful and toxic amphibians can be found in various countries across Central and South America, from Nicaragua in the north to Bolivia, Brazil, and even the Guiana Shield in the south. These frogs reside in warm tropical environments, thriving in both humid lowland rainforests and montane cloud forests. The presence of poison dart frogs is more concentrated in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, where they live under leaf litter, on the forest floor, or even on tree trunks and other vegetation. The name \\"poison dart frog\\" comes from indigenous people's practice of using the frog's toxic secretions to coat blowdarts and hunting weapons. While not all dart frogs are poisonous, the most toxic species, Phyllobates terribilis, has enough venom to kill several adult humans. There are more than 170 described species of poison dart frogs, each with unique appearances, color patterns, and behaviors. The varying levels of toxicity among species can be attributed to differences in diet and habitat.

Q: Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large turbine to harness power. what helps the turbine spin?   A: Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's look at the process step-by-step: 1. The first step in harnessing power from water flowing downhill is to build a dam or barrier across a river or a stream. This helps to create a reservoir that stores a large amount of water at a higher elevation. 2. The water from the reservoir is then allowed to flow downhill through a pipe or a channel called a penstock. The flow of water is regulated by controlling the opening of the penstock. 3. As the water flows downhill, it gains kinetic energy because of the gravitational force acting on it. This kinetic energy is what helps the turbine to spin. 4. The flowing water strikes the blades of the turbine, transferring its kinetic energy to the turbine. This turns the blades of the turbine, causing it to rotate. 5. The spinning action of the turbine is then transferred to a generator via a shaft connected to both the turbine and the generator. 6. The generator converts the mechanical energy from the spinning turbine into electrical energy, which can then be used as a power source. So, the answer to the question is: The kinetic energy of the water flowing downhill, obtained due to the gravitational force acting on it, helps the turbine spin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As she poses in a bikini showing off her defined abs, bulging biceps and super toned legs, it's hard to believe that Rachel Turner was once a size 16 with body confidence issues. But the mother-of-three from Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea, has transformed both her figure and her self-esteem in two years after taking up bodybuilding. The now 42-year-old said it was turning 40 that gave her the impetus to change her life after an under-active thyroid, poor diet and role as a stay-at-home mother led her to pile on the pounds. Scroll down for video. Happier now: Rachel was a size 16 before she dropped her body fat and became a body builder. She said: 'Although I was on medication to tackle my under-active thyroid problem it was still difficult for me to regulate my weight and if I was honest I was not following an entirely healthy eating plan. 'I gave up my job at a law firm to be a stay-at-home mum. I suppose because I enjoyed work and missed being busy during the day I was comfort eating. 'I would buy chocolate bars to snack on whilst cooking the family meal. I would wade through packets of biscuits whilst watching daytime TV and drink untold cups of cappuccino. I would always serve a dessert sweet after our family meal. My eating was out of control.' Toned up: Rachel follows a weight regime and strict protein diet to build her lean muscle. Rachel's weight rose to 12 stone and her confidence and relationship with her husband, David suffered. She explained: 'As my weight increased, I didn't seem to care and allowed my weight and clothes size to balloon. Before I knew it, I was fitting into size 16 clothes. I convinced myself that I was fat and happy. 'I thought if I could dress well and keep my hair and make up nice I could get away with being fat. I was totally kidding myself. One day I caught a glimpse of myself under severe lighting in a changing room. I noticed that not only did I have cellulite on my thighs and bottom but also on my upper arms. I was gobsmacked. I was so busy covering up I hadn't noticed what I was covering up. 'How my body looked at this time affected everything. My relationship with my husband suffered. I didn't want him to look at me let alone touch me. I would jump into bed fully clothed from head to toe.' 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt. washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I. needed to do something about it and fast' Before having children, Rachel had been a trained aerobics instructor who had studied nutrition and enjoyed exercising so she was deeply unhappy with her weight gain and lack of fitness. 'I was snappy with everyone, angry that I let myself get into this state,' she said. It was the milestone birthday of 40 that made her realise she had to turn her life back around. 'I didn't want to be fat, frumpy and forty', she said. 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I needed to do something about it and fast.' Rachel began eating more healthily, cutting out sugary, fatty foods and swapping her milky cappuccinos for black coffee. She attended Zumba and Body Pump classes, did some weights at the gym and started running. Her weight soon dropped and she loved the way her body shape was transforming. 'My arms became more shapely. My back and. shoulders were stronger. My legs and bottom toned and I almost carved. myself a six pack,' she recalls. Life begins at 40: As a stay-at-home mother, Rachel said she let herself get out of shape but turning 40 gave her the impetus to change her life. Her husband noticed how her fitness levels had gone 'through the roof' and suggested she run a marathon. But Rachel dismissed this idea as 'everyone runs the marathon'. 'I want to do something extraordinary,' she added. She has now achieved this by becoming a professional bodybuilder, winning accolades for her physique and aiming to qualify for Miss Universe. As previously reported in the MailOnline, it was former glamour model Jodie Marsh who gave her the idea to become a bodybuilder. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better' She explains: 'In October 2011 I was watching This Morning and I saw Jodie Marsh giving an interview about her bodybuilding. That was my eureka moment - I would become a competitive bodybuilder.' Rachel contacted Jodie's trainer Tim Sharp who devised a weight training and nutrition plan for her to follow. She said: 'I would see Tim once a week and he would send through to my phone my training plan which I would do at my own gym. Tim also sent through my nutrition plan. This included supplements such as protein drinks, glutamine, branch chain aminos and creatine. These were all supplied by LA Muscle who are now my sponsors.' Confident: Rachel used to hide her body away but now she loves to show it off. Under Tim's fitness regime, Rachel dropped body fat and gained lean muscle. She also learnt a choreographed routine in which she forms various poses to music to showcase her muscular figure. She was then ready to enter her first bodybuilding competitions - and hasn't looked back. So far she has been runner up at the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association (NABBA) South East Qualifiers and sixth place at NABBA Britain. She aims to carry on doing well in these competitions so she can go on to represent England in international competitions such as Miss Universe. The body Rachel would hide away two years ago is now one she's proud of. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better,' she said. Rachel Turner is sponsored by LA Muscle and has a show on The Active Channel. Shows can be viewed on their website or on Sky channel 281 and Freesat Channel 408.

I've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person.

Introduction: The ancient pyramids of Egypt have captured the imaginations of people for centuries. They are among the most iconic and fascinating structures in human history. These colossal architectural masterpieces represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian engineering and, even today, the construction methods used to create them remain a subject of considerable debate and wonder. But do you know who designed the first pyramid? Read on and take our quiz to test your knowledge! Step 1: Brief background on the first pyramid Before we reveal the mastermind behind the design of the first pyramid, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with some key facts about the monument. The first pyramid, known as the Step Pyramid, was built during the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, approximately around 2630 B.C. Step Pyramid served as the burial tomb of Pharaoh Djoser, and its construction marks a significant architectural shift from the earlier mastaba-style tombs. It consists of six distinct stacked layers, giving it a stepped appearance and has a height of about 62 meters (203 feet). Step 2: Understanding the significance of pyramid design The pyramids of ancient Egypt were more than just colossal burial tombs; they also held deep spiritual and religious significance for the Egyptians. The pyramid shape was believed to represent the primordial mound from which life emerged and facilitated the pharaoh's journey to the afterlife. The design of these monumental structures evolved over time, from the first step pyramid to the smooth-sided pyramids like the famous Great Pyramid of Giza. Step 3: Introducing the architect behind the first pyramid Now that we have familiarized ourselves with some basic information about the first pyramid, let's move on to our quiz question: Who designed the first pyramid in history? A. Imhotep B. Hemiunu C. Ptah-hotep D. Senenmut The correct answer is A. Imhotep! Imhotep was an eminent Egyptian polymath who served as the royal counselor and vizier to Pharaoh Djoser. More than just an architect, he was also a skilled physician, priest, and political figure. Imhotep is credited with designing and overseeing the construction of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, which was a significant leap from the preceding mastaba tombs. Step 4: Celebrating Imhotep's legacy Imhotep's innovative design for the first pyramid laid the foundation for future pyramid constructions that would go on to define ancient Egypt's architectural landscape. His genius laid the groundwork for monumental advancements in engineering and architecture, leaving a lasting impact not only on Egyptian history but on the world as a whole. In recognition of his exceptional contributions, Imhotep was later deified by the Egyptians and became the god of medicine and healing. His enduring reputation as an ingenious architect, physician, and polymath is a testament to his remarkable talents and a fascinating aspect of human history. Conclusion: The story of the first pyramid design and its mastermind, Imhotep, is a captivating tale that highlights the ingenuity and creativity of ancient Egypt. Whether you aced our quiz or learned something new about the history of the pyramids, it is essential to remember the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the innovators whose incredible achievements continue to shape our world today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Senate GOP blocks Obama's pick for D.C. appeals court ’s pick for a seat on the crucial federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday, dealing the a setback as it continues to struggle to fill judicial vacancies across the nation. The GOP filibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, a New York lawyer who contended was a moderate nominee who had won praise from some conservatives. But Republicans said they were concerned about Halligan’s record on gun rights and terrorism detainee issues. All but one—Alaska’s —voted to prevent her nomination from going forward for a final floor vote, where the judge could have been approved by a simple majority. The final tally was 54-45, six votes short of the 60 needed to break the filibuster. It marked the second time this year that Republicans have filibustered a key Obama judicial nominee. They denied Californian Goodwin Liu a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco in May. Obama eventually withdrew Liu’s nomination, and he was tapped by California Gov. for a seat on the state Supreme Court instead. Obama chose Halligan, a former New York state solicitor general who now serves as general counsel to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered one of the most important federal appellate courts in the nation because of its role in reviewing decisions made by government agencies. A judgeship on the court is often viewed as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court and nominations to the D.C. Circuit have for years prompted clashes between Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, Halligan was picked to replace , who was elevated to the high court as its chief justice in 2005. The vacancy has languished for five years and is now among three on the appeals court. Halligan remains the White House’s lone D.C. Circuit nominee. was able to place three of his nominees on the court, but all came during his second term in office. Senate Democrats and interest groups argued that in blocking Halligan, the GOP abandoned a standard that was agreed upon by both parties in 2005, when Republicans threatened to do away with the judicial filibuster entirely. Then, the so-called “Gang of 14”—a bipartisan group of senators—vowed to push through any nominee except in “extraordinary circumstances.” Obama registered his disappointment in a White House statement, saying Halligan’s nomination “fell victim to the Republican pattern of obstructionism that puts party ahead of country.” Senate Republicans are “blocking 20 other highly qualified judicial nominees,” Obama said. “These are distinguished nominees who, historically, would be confirmed without delay.” GOP senators who were members of the Gang of 14 such as of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and of Arizona, all voted to block Halligan “With Tuesday's filibuster, the ‘Gang of 14’ deal on judicial nominations is officially dead and the partisan war over the courts has escalated to a dangerous new level, even while the vacancy rate on the federal judiciary has reached a crisis point,” said Douglas Kendall, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center. of Kentucky, in remarks on the Senate floor prior to the vote, said that Halligan was ill-suited for the court. “Ms. Halligan’s record strongly suggests that she wouldn’t view a seat on the U.S. appeals court as an opportunity to adjudicate, even-handedly, disputes between parties based on the law, but instead as an opportunity to put her thumb on the scale in favor of whatever individual or group or cause she happens to believe in,” he said. Republicans still invoke the name of Miguel Estrada, who was nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush but whose nomination was stalled by a filibuster eight years ago, as an example of Democratic obstructionism and hypocrisy. But ironically, Estrada has been a vocal supporter of Halligan’s nomination. The Senate has confirmed 24 of Obama’s appeals court nominees and 97 district court nominees over the last three years, with 15 appellate vacancies and 67 trial court slots yet to be filled.

The hypothesis that they are a family is certainly a possibility, but there may be other plausible explanations for why these four individuals are walking together. Let's consider a few alternative scenarios: 1. Friends or neighbors: It's possible that these individuals could be friends or neighbors who have decided to enjoy a walk in the snow together. In this case, they might not be family members but merely enjoying each other's company in their shared outdoor space. 2. Guided tour or group outing: It's also conceivable that the adults and the child could be a part of a guided tour or group outing, in which case they might not be related but simply taking part in the same activity. 3. Chance encounter: Another possibility is that these individuals could have come across one another by chance while walking along this path, and are simply walking in the same direction. In this scenario, they might not know each other at all, let alone be family members. 4. Blended family or multi-generational family: Even if they are family members, there is the possibility that it could be a blended family or a multi-generational family, which would mean the relationships among them might be more complex than simply two parents and their children.

So, choosing a job is one of the most important decisions to make in life. For my job, there are three important things that I will consider: The first one - that I must work in an area I like - is most important to me. Someone once said if you find a job that you enjoy, then you won't have to work another day. I would like to work in an area where I can be more creative. I would like to be the most valuable member there. All this is possible only if I like what I do. The second one is that the area of my work  must lead me to solve some  new  and  hard problems. I would like to stay in the same area for a long time. In order for this to happen, the work must provide enough problems. More than just working to live, I enjoy making a difference and trying my best for the whole progress. I would also like to be well _ for my hard work, so I can lead a comfortable life with this hard-won money. Then I can provide the best for my family. The third important thing is that I would like to work in an area that would help other people. The work in my mind is in fields such as the army, training or management. In such areas, I can help to develop the abilities of others and bring out their best. It would be a most satisfying job to help young people to become the best that they can be. When I become old, I would like to look back with  a great  sense  of  satisfaction  that  thousands  of  people  have  become  better  persons through my work. I accept the idea that no one should make a choice of a job suddenly or quickly. He should decide what he wants to be in the long run. Then, he should decide how he works towards it. He should study the proper courses, read the books and speak to knowledgeable  persons in that field before making a job choice. A good choice will most probably lead to a better life.

The chef tried to store the beef in the freezer but the freezer was too small. He scratched his head, wondering what he could do to make space for the large cut of beef. He decided to take the following steps: 1. Assess the contents of the freezer: Before making any decisions, the chef needed to see what was taking up so much space in the freezer. He opened the door and took a good look at the various ingredients, containers, and frozen meals stuffed inside. 2. Remove non-essential or expired items: The chef figured that there might be some items in the freezer that were past their prime or not immediately necessary for upcoming meals. He began to remove items that were expired, frost-bitten, or not needed in the near future, carefully checking the dates and condition of each item. 3. Rearrange the remaining items: With the non-essential and expired items removed, the chef now had to optimize the remaining space in the freezer. He rearranged the items, placing smaller items and containers inside larger ones, stacking items with flat surfaces, and filling empty spaces in the best possible manner. 4. Consider alternative storage solutions: Despite his best efforts, the chef realized that the freezer was still not large enough to accommodate the huge cut of beef. He began to think of alternative storage solutions, such as splitting the beef into smaller portions and storing them in separate containers, or using a separate cooler with ice packs to keep the beef cold until it could be cooked or a larger storage option could be found. 5. Consult with colleagues: The chef decided to ask his fellow chefs and kitchen staff for their input in case they had faced similar issues in the past. They might have valuable insights or creative solutions that he had not yet considered.

Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

In this case, \\"set\\" is an example of a homograph – a word that is spelled the same way as another word but has a different meaning and may have a different pronunciation. The context in which the word is used helps determine its meaning. Let's examine each sentence separately to understand the different meanings of \\"set.\\" Sentence 1: The film is set in Africa. In this sentence, \\"set\\" is used as a past participle of the verb \\"to set\\" and describes where the action or story of the film takes place. It is referring to the location or setting of the film, which is Africa. The film's events, characters, and settings are all portrayed as taking place within the African continent. In this context, \\"set\\" is related to the establishment of a backdrop or environment for the narrative. Sentence 2: Set up an experiment. In this sentence, \\"set\\" is used as an imperative verb, instructing someone to arrange or establish an experiment. In this context, \\"set up\\" is a phrasal verb that means to prepare or organize something (in this case, an experiment). The person receiving this instruction is expected to put together the necessary materials, equipment, and procedures in order to carry out the experiment. This usage of \\"set\\" conveys actions related to the initiation or creation of a particular activity. In summary, the word \\"set\\" has different meanings in these two sentences.

If \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The VIP address his crowd.\\"?","output":"Yes, it can be logically inferred that \\"The VIP address his crowd\\" if the given statement is \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters.\\" Here's an explanation as to how the connection is made: 1. In the given statement, an \\"important older man\\" is referred to. The word \\"important\\" can be equated to someone with some sort of significance or status, such as a VIP (Very Important Person). So, in this context, it is reasonable to replace the phrase \\"important older man\\" with the term \\"VIP.\\" 2. The statement describes the important older man or VIP giving a \\"speech.\\" Typically, when someone gives a speech, they are addressing an audience, which can also be referred to as a crowd. 3. Now, let's analyze the audience being addressed: \\"reporters.\\" Reporters are people who gather information and distribute news. When a VIP or an important person gives a speech to reporters, it is usually with the intention of disseminating their thoughts or points to a significantly larger group, namely their followers or another group relevant to the VIP's position. In this case, the group of reporters may be considered as a part of the VIP's larger \\"crowd,\\" or as a means to convey the VIP's message to their crowd. 4. Combining the previously mentioned points, the initial statement can be logically rephrased as \\"The VIP address his crowd.\\" Even though the word \\"crowd\\" may not directly imply the group of reporters, it can be assumed that the crowd being addressed includes the reporters as well as the people who will receive the news from these reporters. In conclusion, given the statement \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters,\\" it is logical to infer that \\"The VIP address his crowd\\" can be a valid conclusion. The inference is based on the connections made between the words \\"important older man\\" and \\"VIP,\\" as well as the concept of addressing an audience or crowd through a speech being relayed by reporters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The causes of the Polish-Ottoman War of 1672-76 can be traced to 1666. Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.:273 In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars ). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.:646 What 2 things did the treaty do?","output":"The treaty between Petro Doroshenko, the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, and Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 did two primary things: 1.

Provide support to Doroshenko's bid to gain control of Ukraine: In signing the treaty, the Ottoman Empire indirectly supported Petro Doroshenko's efforts to establish his authority and control over Ukraine, which was embroiled in a power struggle among different factions at that time.

Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return.  Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Washington state experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. The prevalence of wildfires in Washington state would likely result in a larger amount of smoke containing carbon dioxide, among other harmful substances, being released into the atmosphere as a result of the fires. When wildfires occur, various gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter are released into the atmosphere. The nature and concentrations of these pollutants depend on various factors such as the type of vegetation being burned, weather conditions, and the intensity of the fire. People living in the vicinity of wildfires or areas where smoke particles travel due to air currents could be at increased risk of inhaling carbon dioxide and other harmful substances in the smoke. Taking all this into consideration, it can be concluded that more people in Washington state would be inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke due to the higher frequency of wildfires occurring there compared to Oregon. With recurring wildfires, a more significant number of residents living in or near affected areas in Washington state are exposed to harmful air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide. However, it's essential to mention that the impact of wildfires on air quality and human exposure can vary depending on the specific locations of the fires, population densities, and how the smoke disperses in the air. Also, carbon dioxide is just one of the many substances in wildfire smoke that can affect human health. Other pollutants, such as particulate matter and ozone, can also harm the respiratory system and overall health of individuals. In conclusion, Washington state, with its prevalent wildfires year-round, is likely to have more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke than Oregon, which had almost no wildfires. However, a more definitive answer would require assessment of each state's population density, the specific location of the fires, and the patterns of smoke dispersion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Compare the key points - The premise discusses an increase in price volatility due to analysts' recommendations. - The hypothesis states that there is no impact on price changes.

Under the project, which was created as part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the IRS provides funding to programs that offer tax education and representation to low-income individuals. Does it follow that \\"The IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals. \\"?","output":"Yes, it is correct to say that \\"The IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals.\\" As part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented projects aimed at helping low-income individuals with their tax-related needs, to offer tax education and representation to those who might struggle to access these services due to financial constraints. One of the primary reasons the IRS has initiatives in place to support low-income individuals is to help them navigate the often complex and taxing, no pun intended, process of understanding, filing, and complying with tax laws and regulations. These programs are designed to empower and protect the rights of low-income taxpayers by providing them with accurate and relevant information, education, and representation. Some of the programs that the IRS provides financial support to include: 1. Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) - These clinics offer affordable or no-cost legal assistance to low-income individuals who are involved in tax disputes with the IRS. Many LITCs also provide consultations, education, and guidance on taxpayers' rights and responsibilities. The LITC program is run by non-profit organizations, and they receive partial funding from the IRS through grants. 2. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) - The VITA program provides free, basic tax return preparation services to individuals with low-to-moderate incomes, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those with limited English proficiency. The IRS grants funding to partner organizations that manage VITA sites and train volunteers, who in turn, provide free tax help to qualified individuals. 3. Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) - Similar to the VITA program, TCE offers free tax help for individuals aged 60 and older, focusing on issues unique to senior citizens. IRS-certified volunteers, often with backgrounds in retirement planning or counseling, provide the tax assistance. TCE program partners receive grant funding from the IRS to cover operational expenses. 4. IRS outreach programs - The IRS also conducts outreach programs to raise awareness about tax benefits, credits, and other opportunities available to low-income individuals and families. This includes promoting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), and other tax benefits targeted at reducing poverty and providing financial relief to low-income taxpayers. In conclusion, it is accurate to assert that the IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals as part of its commitment to ensure these individuals can access appropriate tax education and representation, as well as receive the necessary support for a better understanding of their tax obligations and rights. These initiatives contribute to the goal of promoting tax compliance and protecting the rights of all taxpayers, regardless of their income level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her.        Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic  artist.        She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died.        Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life.        Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait.        There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday blamed Hamas for abducting three teenagers who went missing in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. \\"This morning I can say what I was unable to say yesterday before the extensive wave of arrests of Hamas members in Judea and Samaria,\\" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. \\"Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas -- the same Hamas that Abu Mazen made a unity government with.  This has severe repercussions.\\" Abu Mazen is another name for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu said he asked  Abbas \\"to do everything to help bring them back in peace.\\"  He's also given security forces orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. One of three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen, according to CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel, which attributed the information to a source at Netanyahu's office.  Israeli and U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the report. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Sunday for the immediate release of the boys. \\"We are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act, although many indications point to Hamas' involvement,\\" Kerry said in a written statement that offered support to the Israeli government. \\"As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past.\\" Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens. 'We'll hug them soon' Gilad Shaar, 16; Naftali Frenkel, 16; and Eyal Yifrach, 19, have been missing since late Thursday or Friday, and were last seen around Gush Etzion, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The three \\"were just on their way home,\\" Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel, told reporters. \\"We trust\\" that they \\"will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon ... and God willing, we'll all be able to celebrate their return safely,\\" she said. She thanked the security forces for their efforts and the U.S. Embassy for its support. \\"We feel waves and waves of prayers and support and positive energy in this direction.\\" Israeli soldiers have detained about 80 Palestinian suspects in the search for the three teens, the IDF said Sunday. Netanyahu on Saturday gave security forces the OK to use \\"all measures\\" at their disposal to find the teenagers. The Palestinian Ministry of Information said in a written statement that the arrests come under \\"flimsy pretexts\\" as a \\"continuation of the aggression\\" on Palestinians. \\"The ministry also asserts that the Israeli military campaign has been on going for decades, during which (Israel) kidnapped the entire Palestinian people,\\" it said. Hamas responds. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza told CNN that Netanyahu's comments attributing blame were \\"stupid and baseless.\\" \\"The arrest campaign made by the Israeli occupation in the West Bank is targeted to break the backbone of Hamas and bring it down,  but the Israelis will not succeed in achieving their goal,\\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said the kidnappings are a reminder of Hamas' tactics.  \\"When the Fatah-Hamas government was formed last month, the international community quickly recognized and welcomed it,\\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \\"Suddenly, Hamas' cruel acts of terrorism were forgotten, their never-ending attempts to harm innocent civilians, along with the Hamas Charter, which calls for the total destruction of the state of Israel.\\"  Now, he wrote, \\"the international community has been given a second chance to correct its moral, diplomatic and strategic mistakes. Wall to wall condemnations of the kidnapping are called for, as well as placing responsibility on the Palestinian government, including the threat of taking physical, economic and diplomatic steps against it.\\" But, he wrote, the international community is \\"keeping silent, and by doing so, not only are the Palestinians receiving a false, lenient message, but Israel also understands again that she has no one to count on but herself, something that will not encourage further compromises on her part in the near future.\\" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said, \\"We are determined in bringing the boys home in a (hasty) manner, in safety and in good health. Palestinian terrorists will not feel safe, will not be able to hide and will feel the heavy arm of the Israeli military capabilities.\\" '#BringBackOurBoys' The abduction of the three teens inspired social media users to use the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys, a reference to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign for more than 200 Nigerian school girls who were kidnapped by militants. The thread quickly became contentious, with pro-Palestinian users alleging many Palestinian children have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers and imprisoned.

Which circuit would have higher temperature, circuit A or circuit B?  John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged.  Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Answer:","output":"Circuit B would have a higher temperature, as it has lower resistance, which would result in more current flowing through it, causing it to overheat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend studied less about the natural development of species?  Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time. Trent Green had been ruled out to start in the game, but has been cleared by doctors to begin practicing with the squad.  Ronnie Cruz, the Chiefs' only fullback, is out for the year following an unspecified knee injury.  Tight end Kris Wilson took over for Cruz.  The Chiefs also signed fullback Greg Hanoian in the days before the game to add depth to the position. The game started with the Chiefs forcing turnovers on San Diego's first four possessions.  Damon Huard later converted turnovers with two touchdown passes.  Jared Allen forced a fumble from quarterback Philip Rivers, recovered by Tamba Hali.  The Chiefs took advantage of the turnover by scoring a touchdown with Eddie Kennison, making the lead 14-0.  The Chargers would kick a field goal and the Chiefs would respond with a 15-yard field goal extending the lead to 20-3.  The Chargers would not go into halftime with a 17-point deficit, so they kicked another field goal with 5&#160;minutes to halftime. The game was tied for the rest of the fourth quarter until 33&#160;seconds remained when Damon Huard led the Chiefs to a 52-yard gain with 3 passes&#8212;two of them to Tony Gonzalez for 37&#160;yards. The gain by Gonzalez set up for a game-winning field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes.

There were no signs of an imminent deal based on the comments by the top executives at their presentations to the UBS Global Media and Communication Conference held Monday. Neither CBS Corp. Chairman Leslie Moonves nor Viacom interim Chief Executive Bob Bakish hinted of an immediate future together. Although he acknowledged that “anything can happen,” Moonves expressed confidence that CBS would continue to prosper on its own. “We are very happy the way we are as a stand-alone company,” Moonves said. “We’ve said this and we truly believe this. There is nothing that we want. There is nothing that we lack. Our stock hit a 52-week high this week. We are executing tremendously.” For his part, Bakish, who took his post Nov. 15 after running Viacom’s international businesses for the last nine years, said his focus will be a turnaround of the struggling media conglomerate while a special committee evaluates a possible CBS deal. “My mandate from the board is to drive Viacom as a strong independent company and to revitalize areas of our performance,” he said. “Whether or not [a CBS transaction happens] we will ensure Viacom can be as strong as it can be.” At the urging of Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, the controlling shareholders of the two companies, each firm has formed a special committee to explore a merger. Viacom and CBS were part of the same company until Sumner Redstone cleaved his empire in two in 2006. Analysts widely expect that should the two companies merge, Moonves would be entrusted to run a combined CBS/Viacom. Moonves is respected on Wall Street and enjoys a strong working relationship with Shari Redstone. But a CBS executive familiar with the talks said no action is expected before the end of this year. CBS also has improved its businesses — becoming a major producer and seller of programming to overseas broadcasters and streaming services — at a time when Viacom has suffered ratings declines. That was reflected in Monday’s remarks by Moonves, who touted a strong fall prime-time launch for the most-watched TV network because all five of its new series have been picked up for a full season. He also said all of the network’s sports contracts are profitable, including the 1-billion-a-year deal with the NFL. Moonves said despite the ratings declines in NFL viewing this season — largely blamed on competition from the compelling presidential election campaign — it continues to be the best product on television. (His network carries a Sunday package and the first half of the “Thursday Night Football” schedule). The telecast draws the largest TV audiences and provides a promotional platform for other CBS programming, luring young male viewers who don’t watch a lot of network television. “I remember the three years we didn’t have it from 1995 to 1998,” he said. “The network fell apart.” The NFL is also a reason that Moonves believes AT&T will eventually make a deal to carry the network on its new streaming service. CBS is the only major broadcast network not offered in the package that gives subscribers 80 channels for 35 a month. Quoting his favorite film “The Godfather” when talking about the negotiations, Moonves said, “We’re not unreasonable people.” Moonves also said he is “guardedly optimistic” that CBS will make a deal with Warner Bros. to bring back another season of TV’s top-rated sitcom,“The Big Bang Theory.” The network is currently in negotiation with the studio that produces “Big Bang.” Though expensive, the show is still valuable in helping build other new series on the schedule. On the Viacom side, Bakish touted the value of the company’s cable network brand names, which are still growing overseas. He said reviving MTV and Comedy Central will be a priority. “We’ve lost share and we need to take that back,” he said. Bakish indicated that he would like to see MTV return to its roots in music programming. He also offered a vote of confidence in “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, saying the topical comedy program’s ratings have held up since the end of the presidential election. Bakish shut down speculation that Viacom is eyeing a stake in the youth-oriented media company Vice. “We are not going to do it,” he said.","output":"CBS and Viacom Merger: Possible but Not in 2016"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Christopher Houston Carson (December 24, 1809 - May 23, 1868), better known as Kit Carson, was an American frontiersman. He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major General Carleton refused. Kit was ordered to invade the Canyon de Chelly. It was here that many Navajos had taken refuge. Historian David Roberts writes, \\"Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863-1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign.\\"  The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary. Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called Fortress Rock. They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight. These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the 35-mile (56 km) Canyon with his forces. The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the United States could invade their country at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at Fort Canby.  By March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby. An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp. They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger. Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them. The thousands of Navajo were led to Bosque Redondo. Many died along the way. Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed. In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as Long Walk of the Navajo. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure. Major Carleton was fired. Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were they ever attacked there?","output":"The original text provided does not contain any specific article to quote from, nor does it have any clear indication that the Navajos were attacked in a specific location during Kit Carson's campaign.

Though few Navajos were killed or captured during Carson's invasion of Canyon de Chelly, the invasion demonstrated that their lands could be invaded by the United States at any time, leading to the surrender of many Navajos at Fort Canby."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Humans may use a host of facial cues – visible just hours after an infection starts – to avoid contracting illnesses from others, study indicates      Coughing, sneezing and clutching the stomach might be obvious signs of sickness, but humans can also spot if someone is healthy simply from a glance at their face, new research suggests.      Scientists have found that signs of a person being acutely unwell – such as pale lips, a downward turn of the mouth and droopy eyelids – are visible just hours after an infection begins.            “We use a number of facial cues from other people and we probably judge the health in other people all the time,” said John Axelsson, a co-author of the research and a professor at the stress research institute at Stockholm University.      While previous work has shown that besides overt symptoms – such as sniffing – changes in skin colour can serve as a guide to health, experts say the latest study highlights the ways in which humans might use a host of early signals to avoid contracting infection from others.            Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Axelsson and colleagues described how they injected 16 healthy adults with a placebo and, at a separate point in time, molecules from E coli which are known to rapidly trigger flu-like symptoms. The participants were unaware which injection they had received, and were photographed about two hours after each injection.      The team then showed the portraits to 62 participants who were asked to judge whether the pictured person was sick or healthy, with each picture shown for a maximum of five seconds.            The results reveal that the participants were able to spot a sick person slightly better than if they were guessing, correctly identifying someone as being unwell 52% of the time. However, more impressively, they correctly labelled individuals as being healthy 70% of the time.      Happily disgusted? Scientists map facial expressions for 21 emotions Read more      Axelsson said the judgement of whether someone was sick or healthy might vary depending on the people analysing the images, noting that people looking for a partner might be better at spotting signs of health, while those afraid of catching an infection might be better at noticing cues for sickness. “I think it depends a bit on the context you are in, on what you are sensitive for,” he said.      To delve deeper a new group of 60 participants were shown the photographs, without being told which injection had been given.            Individuals photographed after being injected with the E coli molecules were, on average, rated as looking more sick and more tired than in photos taken after they were given the placebo. They were also rated as having a more swollen face, redder eyes, less glossy and less patchy skin as well as a more drooping mouth, hanging eyelids and – in particular – paler lips.      However further analysis showed that just how sick a person was judged was most reliably linked to paler skin and droopier eyelids.            Professor Ben Jones of the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow welcomed the research. “This study adds to growing evidence for the existence of facial cues associated with acute sickness and help us understand how, unfortunately, social stigmas about people suffering illnesses might emerge,” he said.      But he noted that the study did not replicate real life, where faces can show many types of variation, even in the same person. Also, other studies have used the same set of photographs, meaning caution was needed against conclusions based on only a small group of individuals.            Dr Carmen Lefevre of the centre for behaviour change at University College London also raised concerns about the small number of people who had been photographed. Nonetheless, she said the research supports the idea that humans have developed a range of behavioural mechanisms to help avoid catching diseases. “This is the first study [to show] that illness [is detectable] shortly after onset,” she added.      Dr Rachel McMullan of the Open University said that it would be helpful to look at whether the results held for a wide range of ethnic groups and for different diseases, but added the results suggested ill individuals could be spotted soon after infection.            “Being able to quickly identify and avoid potentially sick, contagious individuals will certainly be an evolutionary advantage and this study is a good starting point for further research into the how we detect early signs of infection,” she said.       ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Two ways you can tell someone is sick just by looking at them      When you’re sick, it’s written all over your face. That’s the conclusion of a new study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , which finds that sick people share facial features—pale skin, swollen faces, droopy eyelids, and looking tired—that reveal they might be contagious. Although those signs may seem obvious, no one has explicitly tested them until now. Researchers took mug shots of 16 Caucasian volunteers a few hours after injecting them with a placebo or a piece of bacteria that made people feel sick and caused their immune systems to respond as if they had an infection. They then showed the photos to 62 people, who rated the faces (pictured above as composite images with noninfected individuals on the left and infected on the right) as “sick” or “healthy” in 5 seconds or less. Raters identified 81% of sick people better than chance. But, what is it about our faces that give away whether we’re feeling under the weather? To find this out, a separate group of 60 people assessed how sick and tired the people in the photos looked and the extent to which each trait—pale skin and lips, droopy eyelids and corners of the mouth, how puffy their faces looked, eye redness, and tiredness—publicized illness. The researchers found pale skin and hanging eyelids were the best predictors of sickness. So, if staying healthy is part of your New Year’s resolution, perhaps give pallid and tired looking friends and colleagues a wide berth. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"New research suggests that humans can identify early signs of illness in others by observing facial cues, such as pale lips, droopy eyelids, and a downward turn of the mouth.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

This recommendation is based on the fact that some local governments and real estate websites make this data accessible online, making it easier and more efficient for homeowners to start their research from the comfort of their own home rather than going to a real estate office in person. In today's digital world, the internet can provide a wealth of information that can help individuals make informed decisions.

(CNN)Two Renaissance sculptures of a nude man riding a panther may have been created by Michelangelo, says a British museum. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge says that the bronze sculptures, known as the Rothschild Bronzes and dating from the 1500s, were probably created just after the famed artist's David and just before he painted the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. The museum and researchers at the University of Cambridge say they have \\"compelling evidence\\" that the works, attributed to a Dutch sculptor, are actually from Michelangelo. If so, they are the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world, says the museum. The key clue that the unsigned bronzes were actually done by Michelangelo came from one of the master's apprentices. Last year, Paul Joannides, a Cambridge art history professor, noted that a Michelangelo student had made a study of several Michelangelo sketches for works believed lost. One of the drawings in the study, which dates from 1508, matched one of the bronzes. Further research indicated they were in Michelangelo's style, and X-rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation. \\"Even a peroneal tendon is visible, as is the transverse arch of the foot,\\" wrote University of Warwick anatomist Peter Abrahams, according to the UK Guardian. Victoria Avery, keeper of applied arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, described the project to the Guardian as \\"a Renaissance whodunit.\\" She says that the museum was careful in assembling the evidence and that the works are masterpieces. \\"The modeling is superb, they are so powerful and so compelling, so whoever made them had to be superb,\\" she said. The works -- and some of the evidence -- will be on display at the Fitzwilliam from Tuesday through August 9. Though the museum is confident of the works' origins, research is continuing, and results will be presented at a conference in early July. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

How do their actions affect you? Have you ever seen a big yummy cake and you just couldn't stop thinking about it? Being obsessed with someone is a similar feeling. When you're obsessed with someone, you can't stop thinking about them. You want to know everything about them and be around them all the time. When you're obsessed, their actions affect you a lot. For example, if they smile at you, you might get very happy. But if they don't talk to you, you might feel sad. You become very sensitive to their actions because you think about them so much. 3. Are these questions the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question talks about how the things happening around you can change your actions.

Question: Which happened later, the Lexicon Technicum was published, or it was drafted? Context: The first technical dictionary was drafted by John Harris and entitled Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences. Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing.","output":"The Lexicon Technicum was published later than it was drafted. The context states that it was \\"drafted by John Harris\\" and then \\"published in 1704.\\" The drafting process comes before the publication, so drafting happened first and publishing happened later."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A comma should be placed before and after such clauses to set them off from the main clause. 2.

Q:The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker. He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed.

Here is an article: A young company with a one-of-a-kind technological innovation is celebrating a milestone that's enabling tens of millions of children worldwide to better access the power of play. One World Futbol Project, founded in 2010, produced and delivered its millionth ultra-durable soccer ball at a school in South Africa with the help of Chevrolet, its founding corporate partner, the companies announced on Monday. The millionth ball was delivered as part of a ceremony during which Chevrolet and local partner, Dreamfields Project unveiled a new soccer pitch at the Mabu-a-tiou girls' primary school in Hammanskraal, South Africa, on Saturday. One World, a certified B Corporation founded in 2010, partnered with Chevrolet two years ago to donate and distribute 1.5 million balls to communities in need around the globe. As part of its What Do You #PlayFor campaign, Chevrolet is also rebuilding soccer pitches, including the one at Mabu-a-tiou. Dreamfields provides soccer kits, boots and balls for the students, including those at the 17 schools that attended Saturday's event. Young women at the Mabu-a-tiou school in South Africa play with a One World futbol. \\"It was a beautiful moment none of us will soon forget,\\" Tim Mahoney, Global Chevrolet's chief marketing officer, told Mashable in an email. \\"It showed how this sport can help us to share the power of play, and create possibilities for people all around the world.” The revitalized pitch in Hammanskraal, a rural town north of Pretoria, looked \\"tired and neglected\\" before these organizations got ahold of it, according to Dreamfields CEO and founder John Perlman. While Chevrolet provided the funds and One World the balls, Dreamfields will be responsible for helping maintain the renovated pitch, which was deliberately kept soil-based, in light of water scarcity in the community. Dreamfields is also in the process of distributing 4,000 One World soccer balls to programs across South Africa. One World Futbol founders Lisa and Tim Jahnigen with the millionth ball, the South African students, and their former ball. After seeing images of children in underdeveloped nations playing soccer with balls made from trash, One World founder Tim Jahnigen conceived of a ball that wouldn't deflate, even if punctured. A chance meeting with Sting led to the music legend and philanthropist providing the funding needed to research and develop the ball, which is created using an injection-molded foam. It withstands the rigors of rough terrain and, because of its unique design, doesn't need to be inflated. Calling the millionth ball a \\"milestone achievement,\\" Sting said Monday in an emailed statement that he's \\"proud to be part of an initiative that brings the transformative power of play to children who need it most.\\" All over the world, nonprofit organizations are relying on the indestructible ball to lead programs that empower young people, from urban centers to rural communities. In these places, play is not just a luxury — it also encourages learning and personal development. The following video details the work of another One World Futbol project in Zanzibar, the site of the organization's first large-scale drop (a delivery of 20,000 balls), as part of its partnership with Chevrolet. In it, Mubarak Maman, a director at Save the Children in Tanzania, describes the importance of One World's mission to provide durable soccer balls. Play is like \\"food, it's like clothes, it's one of the components that contributes positively to the development of a healthy child,\\" he says. Ben Gucciardi, who uses the unbreakable ball in the Soccer Without Borders program at an Oakland, California, public school for refugee and immigrant youth, said his kids' participation in soccer often helps keep them in school. Doc Lawson, a former soccer star who now runs a program for youth in his native Liberia, told Mashable in January that he was running through \\"15 to 20 balls a day\\" before he began to use the One World football, which he called a \\"hero ball.\\" Perlman, too, echoed that sentiment. \\"Here, we talk about that ball as the miracle ball,\\" Lawson said in an interview Thursday. \\"Because in the communities that we work, hope is in quite short supply. And disappointment is such a part of the ether\\" that the simple durability of the ball is a powerful force. It sends a message that says, \\"Actually, there are some things in life that are indestructible and uncrushable,\\" he added. According to One World internal numbers, 1 million footballs represents 30 million kids globally who are more able to play on a regular basis. But that means more than just having fun: It's \\"learning to win, learning to lose, learning to see life in longer timelines,\\" Perlman said. And if that still sounds frivolous, see the United Nations' Declaration of the Rights of the Child — play has long been designated a human right. \\"While the ball technology is unique, the real magic is not in the ball,\\" Jahnigen said in a statement from Saturday's unveiling of the new soccer pitch in South Africa. \\"It is what happens when children are allowed to play.\\" Have something to add to this story?

Rishi is a little immature and stubborn, and this keeps on causing fights at home with his equally headstrong wife Nicky. Rishi and Deep are dedicated musicians, obsessive about the music of R.D. Burman. They play at a club sometimes and compete in an annual pop music contest called \\"Jhankaar Beats\\" — they have lost for the past two years. When the movie starts, Rishi has been kicked out of his house by Nicky and the two are considering getting a divorce. Deep's nagging mother-in-law has come for a two-month visit. The men are under pressure to get an advertising campaign ready for a new client, an oddball condom manufacturer. Around this time they meet Indraneel (Shayan Munshi, Neel for short), who is the son of their boss Mr. Kapoor and is joining the company.  Neel is an ace guitarist who has his own problems — he is attracted to a pretty girl, Preeti but cannot muster the courage to talk to her. To make things worse, his father has decided that he is wasting his life and has given him an ultimatum — find a girl in two months or settle down with a wife his parents choose. Rishi and Deep, though they tease him mercilessly, grow very fond of Neel, and he has a sure ally in Shanti. Shanti, meanwhile, is trying to get Rishi to see sense and make up with Nicky. There are a host of colourful supporting characters, among them a newlywed couple living above Deep's flat, Nicky's handsome lawyer, and the very sexy owner of a rival advertising agency. How they resolve all their issues forms the rest of the story.  answer the following question:  What is the nickname of the person whose father has decided that he is wasting his life? A:","output":"A: The nickname of the person whose father has decided that he is wasting his life is Neel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How do you say \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" in Spanish?","output":"To translate \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" to Spanish, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main components of the sentence:    - \\"Originally\\" is an adverb that indicates the initial circumstance.    - \\"there were\\" is a past tense of the verb \\"to be\\" (in this case, indicating existence).    - \\"ten\\" is a numeral indicating the quantity.    - \\"basins\\" is a plural noun, the object of the sentence. 2. Translate the components to their Spanish equivalents:    - \\"Originally\\" can be translated as \\"originalmente\\" or \\"inicialmente\\".    - \\"there were\\" in this context can be translated as \\"había\\" (past tense of \\"haber\\" to express existence).    - \\"ten\\" can be translated as \\"diez\\".    - \\"basins\\" can be translated as \\"cuencas\\" (if referring to geographical basins) or \\"recipientes\\" (if referring to containers). 3. Combine the translated components to form the sentence in Spanish:    - Assuming you are referring to geographical basins, the sentence would be: \\"Inicialmente había diez cuencas.\\"    - If you are referring to basins as containers, the sentence would be: \\"Inicialmente había diez recipientes.\\" Therefore, \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" can be translated to Spanish as \\"Inicialmente había diez cuencas.\\" or \\"Inicialmente había diez recipientes.\\" depending on the context."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Because time does not permit I do not want to go into an in depth analysis and talk about how, when the Liberal government took office in 1993, the unemployment rate was at 11.5 percent and today as we all know it is 9 percent and dropping; how we inherited a 42 billion deficit from a Conservative government that had never met its budget targets; or how we inherited a country so weakened from all aspects that we were being described as a third world economy. Can we draw the following conclusion? There was not enough time to go into details","output":"Based on the provided information, it seems that the lack of time was a significant factor that prevented an in-depth analysis of the mentioned economic and political issues. Nonetheless, an overview of the key points can be helpful in understanding the context and the reasons behind the expressed concern.  When the Liberal government came into power in 1994, it faced considerable challenges, including an unemployment rate of 11.5 percent, a 42 billion deficit accrued from the Conservative government, and a national image of being a weakened economy, leading to the term 'a third world economy.' However, now the unemployment rate is at 9 percent, suggesting an improvement in the situation. The high unemployment rate in 1993 was likely a result of various factors, such as insufficient job opportunities, poor labor market conditions, economic policies, or other structural factors. With the new government in place, it can be inferred that some measures have been implemented to address this issue, leading to the unemployment rate's drop to 9 percent. However, without a detailed analysis, it is not clear which specific policies and steps have been taken to achieve this improvement. Similarly, the 42 billion deficit often reflects a situation where the government's debt has significantly increased due to excessive spending, inadequate revenue generation, or ineffective fiscal policies. Upon inheriting this deficit, the Liberal government likely had to make some tough decisions and implement various measures to control the budget and to work towards reducing the deficit. Again, without a detailed analysis, it is not possible to pinpoint which specific policies and actions have been employed and how effective they have been in addressing the deficit issue. Finally, the country's perception as a third-world economy had to be addressed by strengthening the economic position and showing progress and growth to the international community. This perception might have been a result of poor economic indicators, slow growth rates, inadequate infrastructure, or other socio-economic factors. It is very likely that the Liberal government took several measures to address these issues and boost economic growth, but without a detailed analysis, it is not feasible to determine which specific strategies have been employed and how successful they have been. Therefore, although time does not permit a comprehensive examination of the outlined issues and the efforts of the Liberal government, we can draw the conclusion that the lack of time led to only a superficial understanding of the situation. A detailed analysis would allow for a more profound understanding of the factors that contributed to the problems and the effectiveness of the policies and actions taken by the government in navigating these challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - exhausted - lonely - worked all day - were very tired - feel better  I believe the correct choice is \\"were very tired\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The question posed seems to indicate that the speaker, and possibly others, have not experienced rest recently, which might suggest that they have been engaging in a significant amount of physical or mental activity. To better understand and analyze the given response options, let us examine each possibility: 1. Exhausted: If someone feels exhausted, it implies that they have reached a state of extreme fatigue. Enduring long stretches of work or intense activity can cause a person to feel exhausted. This could be an accurate choice to describe the speaker's feeling due to a lack of rest, as exhaustion often results from overexertion. 2. Lonely: Feeling lonely generally refers to experiencing a sense of isolation or longing for companionship. While a lack of rest can undoubtedly affect a person's emotional state, the feeling of loneliness is not necessarily directly linked to their physical condition or energy levels. Thus, this choice may not be the most accurate representation of the speaker's feelings. 3. Worked all day: This statement simply implies that the person has spent their entire day engaged in work. While this might be true, it does not provide information about how they feel due to their lack of rest. It is a description of the situation rather than the feeling they experience. 4. Were very tired: If someone feels very tired, it implies that they have experienced fatigue as a result of either physical or mental strain. Fatigue can range from mild to severe and is often directly related to the amount of rest or sleep a person gets. Choosing \\"were very tired\\" gives a more accurate representation of how the speaker feels. It reflects the fact that the speaker has not had sufficient rest and that the feeling stems from their fatigue. 5. Feel better: This statement signifies that the speaker's condition has improved, which seems contradictory to the posed question. Without rest, it is difficult for someone to genuinely feel better as fatigue still affects their overall well-being. Therefore, this choice is less likely to be the correct description. Considering the analysis of these options, the most appropriate choice appears to be \\"were very tired.\\" This option highlights the direct relationship between the lack of rest and the feeling of fatigue that the speaker is experiencing. Furthermore, it emphasizes that their physical or mental exertion has led to a state of weariness, reinforcing the importance of rest to maintain overall well-being and energy levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The risks involved with \\"the largest UK government-run IT project in history\\" were \\"staggering\\", a report said. It recommended that the government drastically scale back the programme or abandon it altogether. Smart Energy GB, the independent body set up to publicise smart meters, said the IoD wanted to take the UK \\"back to an analogue dark age\\". Energy-saving digital smart meters, designed to replace existing analogue gas and electricity meters, should help householders to monitor their energy-use far more accurately, and energy companies to do away with estimated bills. By some estimates, the new meters could save us £17bn on our energy bills. But the IoD believes the government's plan to roll out smart meters to all 30 million UK households by 2020 is far too ambitious. \\"The pace of technological innovation may well leave the current generation of meters behind and leave consumers in a cycle of installation, de-installation and re-installation,\\" it said. Under the scheme, energy companies must begin offering free smart meters to their customers from the autumn. Despite the £11bn estimated cost to the industry, it will not be compulsory to have one. Responding to the IoD report, Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Smart Energy GB, said: \\"The IoD does not understand what's needed to secure Britain's energy infrastructure for the future. \\"The smart meter rollout must be for everybody. It will only deliver the national transformation Britain needs if every home is part of this national upgrade.\\" Nearly 1.4 million households have already had a smart meter installed, he added. But the IoD isn't the only body concerned about the smart meter programme. Earlier this month, the Parliament's Energy and Climate Change Committee said the project was in danger of becoming a costly mistake. The MPs are concerned that allowing each energy company to come up with its own smart meter solution, rather than adopting an industry-wide approach, could lead to inefficiency and further delay. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Institute of Directors (IoD) has suggested that the UK government's plan to roll out smart meters to all 30 million UK households by 2020 is too ambitious, as the current technology may become obsolete due to the pace of innovation.

However, Smart Energy GB, an independent body supporting smart meters, argues that the IoD is trying to take the UK back to an \\"analogue dark age.\\" While nearly 1.4 million households already have a smart meter installed, the Parliament's Energy and Climate Change Committee has also expressed concerns about the project becoming a costly mistake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father (Ken Ogata) would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt (Hideko Yoshida) reads a list of \\"beautiful things\\" from Sei Shnagon's the book of observations.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person does more exercise happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"When a person engages in more exercise, there can be both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. Let's break down how the increased exercise might affect the various stages of digestion: 1. Food intake: With more exercise, the body requires additional energy, leading to an increase in appetite. As a result, people who exercise more may consume more food to meet their increased energy demands. 2. Chewing and saliva production: Exercise can stimulate the release of saliva by increasing blood flow to the salivary glands. Additionally, as people become more aware of their health and fitness, they might pay more attention to chewing their food properly, which can promote better digestion. 3. Stomach function and acid secretion: Exercise, particularly moderate-intensity aerobic exercises, can stimulate more frequent stomach contractions and enhance blood flow to the stomach. This increased blood flow can allow the stomach to secrete more acid, improving the breaking down of food. 4. Intestinal transit rate: Physical activity can positively influence gut motility, speeding up the movement of food through the digestive system. This helps prevent constipation and promotes more efficient absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. 5. Enzyme secretion and nutrient absorption: Exercise can increase the secretion of digestive enzymes in the small intestine, facilitating a more efficient breakdown of food into its constituent nutrients. Better circulation due to exercise will also aid in the absorption of these nutrients, supplying the body with more energy and supporting overall health. 6. Colon function: Regular physical activity promotes the healthy functioning of the colon, thus reducing the risk of constipation and digestive disorders. 7. Expulsion of waste: Increased exercise can lead to frequent bowel movements as it aids in the proper function of the colon. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more exercise will have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. Increased physical activity can improve overall digestion efficiency and promote a healthier gastrointestinal function. It is essential to note, however, that adequate rest and recovery periods are crucial to maintaining the positive effects of exercise on the body and digestive system."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The sight I saw was heartbreaking. The broken houses seemed to be crying. I couldn't describe how I felt. But something special among the debris   turned my day around. I joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand. It was a jacket,and I was excited since Halloween  was coming and I thought I had found a great costume . After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point  , the United States Military Academy, and it had the name \\"deGavre\\" written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket's owner and return it. I called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn't be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993. I sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero's wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook. Finding Chester deGavre's jacket and connecting to his family with the help of Facebook have been so meaningful to me. I've formed a bond  with amazing people I might have never met.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Struggling State Economies: A Challenge for Republican Presidential Hopefuls Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal As the next US presidential election inches closer, potential candidates from both sides of the political spectrum are getting ready to throw their hats into the ring. However, for two Republican governors mulling a White House run, their respective state's economic struggles may prove to be a significant hurdle in their campaigns. Long-time New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and outgoing Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal both have to contend with considerable budget deficits and a lackluster economic performance in their states. New Jersey's high-profile Governor Chris Christie, known for his blunt persona and battles with the state's teacher unions, has been in office since 2010. Over the years, the Garden State has faced multiple economic issues, including a lagging recovery from the Great Recession, declining state revenues, and a looming public pension crisis. This has resulted in an 8 billion deficit for the state. Under Christie's leadership, New Jersey has struggled to stay afloat in comparison to its neighbors, like New York and Pennsylvania, who have both experienced growth and prosperity. The state's credit rating has suffered nine downgrades during his tenure, leaving it with one of the lowest ratings in the country. Critics say that this has happened due to Christie's mismanagement of state finances and his insistence on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, with little consideration given to investing in public services, infrastructure, and education. Christie has defended his economic record, citing the fact that New Jersey has added around 150,000 private sector jobs, and has experienced an overall job growth of 1.4%. He also claims that tax cuts have helped attract businesses to invest in the state. However, detractors argue that these figures are unimpressive compared to neighboring states, and that New Jersey's unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In the Southern state of Louisiana, two-term Governor Bobby Jindal is also dealing with questions about his state's economic health. Jindal inherited a 1 billion surplus when he assumed office in 2008, but as he exits the governor's mansion, the state now faces a 1.6 billion deficit.  The Louisiana economy has faced numerous setbacks, including a drop in oil prices, which make up a significant portion of the state's revenue. Jindal's critics argue that his administration's policies have exacerbated the state's economic woes. These policies include cutting taxes and maintaining tax breaks for corporations at the expense of critical social services and education funding.  Jindal has taken a hard stance against increasing taxes, asserting that tax increases would drive away businesses. However, with major cuts to education, healthcare, and social services, it remains unclear whether his anti-tax stance and conservative policies have been effective in maintaining a sustainable economy in Louisiana. As candidates declare their intentions to run for the presidency, economic issues will dominate the campaigns. For both Christie and Jindal, their state's struggling economies may be a difficult hurdle for them to overcome as they vie for the Republican nomination. Each candidate will have to convince voters that despite the economic challenges faced by their states, they have the necessary experience and policies to successfully steer the U.S. economy in a positive direction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, if you have to be at work or school at 8 and it takes you an hour to get ready and a ½ hour to commute, you need to wake up no later than 6:30 am. Build in a cushion in case you run late. Avoid using an alarm that plays loud and banging music or that has annoying high-pitched noises. Open your eyes and let them get used to the light.

Since the perturbation hypothetically only affects the lid, it would not have a direct effect on the process.

During this time, the military dictatorship conducted a clandestine operation to eliminate any political opponents and dissenters. It's estimated that around 30,000 individuals were \\"disappeared\\", which means they were kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by the regime. In the face of government denial and indifference, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo began gathering in Buenos Aires' central square in 1977 to demand information about their missing children and hold the government accountable for their atrocities. The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought was established by the European Parliament in 1988 in honor of the Soviet physicist and human rights activist, Andrei Sakharov.

Open your door carefully.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Maneuvering Your Vehicle in Tight Spots: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: Every driver encounters tight spots at some point in their life behind the wheel. Whether it's a crowded parking lot, a narrow alley, or a congested traffic lane, these situations can be both challenging and intimidating for many. Adjusting your vehicle in tight spots, restarting when necessary, and carefully opening your doors can make a significant difference in ensuring a smooth, safe, and stress-free driving experience. In this article, we will discuss these steps in detail and provide valuable tips for navigating tight spaces with ease. Step 1: Assess The Situation Before attempting to navigate a tight spot, it's crucial to assess the situation. Determine the available space, the angle of approach, and predict any potential obstacles. This initial understanding allows you to adapt your strategy accordingly. Step 2: Adjust Your Vehicle Position Once you've sized up the situation, adjust your vehicle's position to create adequate room for maneuvering. If parking, approach the spot at a slow pace and use your mirrors to gain a good view of your surroundings. Move your car at a steady pace and use reference points to stay aware of the proximity to other vehicles, walls, or curbs. If necessary, apply the following rule of thumb:  1. Make necessary adjustments to your seating and mirrors. 2. Take note of the surrounding objects or vehicles to avoid collision. 3. Start by steering your wheels in the opposite direction of the tight spot to create an angle for entry. 4. As your vehicle enters the tight space, steer your wheels in the direction of the parking spot. 5. Adjust your vehicle accordingly until properly maneuvered into position. Step 3: Start Over Whenever Necessary If your initial attempt to adjust your vehicle in a tight spot isn't successful, don't be afraid to start over. It's better to make multiple attempts than to risk hitting another vehicle or object. Put your vehicle in reverse, carefully back up while scanning for potential obstacles, and reattempt the maneuver. Be patient and remember that practice makes perfect. Step 4: Open Your Door Carefully Once your vehicle is in the desired position, proceed with caution when opening the doors. Check for nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles before you open the door fully, and consider using your car's window to get a better view of your surroundings. Conclusion: Adjusting your vehicle in tight spots can be challenging, but with practice, patience, and the right approach, every driver can master this essential skill. Remember to assess the situation, adjust your vehicle accordingly, start over when needed, and always open your doors carefully. Incorporate these valuable tips into your driving routine, and you'll soon find yourself navigating tight spaces with confidence and ease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer?","output":"In Greek mythology, Pasiphaë gave birth to the Minotaur, a fearsome creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull. To understand the origins of the Minotaur, it is crucial to examine the characters and the myth surrounding this creature. Pasiphaë was the daughter of the sun god Helios and the nymph Perseis. She was a powerful sorceress and the queen of Crete, married to King Minos. King Minos was the son of Zeus and Europa and was famous for his wisdom and fairness. However, the story of the Minotaur's birth reveals a darker side to the king and his family. According to the myth, King Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a magnificent bull as a sign of his divine support for Minos' kingship. Poseidon granted his request and sent a magnificent white bull, known as the Cretan Bull, from the depths of the sea. Minos was supposed to sacrifice this bull in Poseidon's honor, acknowledging the god's role in his rise to power. However, Minos was so captivated by the bull's beauty that he decided to keep it and sacrifice another bull in its place. Poseidon, enraged by Minos' disrespect, decided to punish him. The god of the sea conspired with Pasiphaë's jealous suitors to cast a spell on her, causing her to develop an uncontrollable desire for the Cretan Bull. Unable to resist her unnatural urges, Pasiphaë enlisted the help of the famed inventor Daedalus to create a wooden cow covered with real cowhide. Pasiphaë climbed inside the hollow cow and was able to deceive the bull, which then mated with her. As a result of this strange union, Pasiphaë became pregnant and later gave birth to the half-human, half-bull creature called the Minotaur, which had the body of a man and the head of a bull. Ashamed and fearful of the monstrous offspring, King Minos again turned to Daedalus for assistance. Daedalus designed an elaborate labyrinth to imprison the Minotaur and hide it from the world. The labyrinth was so intricate that no one who entered it could ever find their way out, thus effectively incarcerating the Minotaur within its walls. To satiate the Minotaur's insatiable hunger for human flesh, Minos demanded human tributes from the city of Athens, which had submitted to his reign following their defeat in a war. Every nine years, seven young Athenian men and seven young Athenian women were sent into the labyrinth as sacrifices to the Minotaur. The Minotaur's ultimate demise came at the hands of the Athenian hero Theseus. With the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne, who had fallen in love with Theseus, the hero entered the labyrinth, navigated its twists and turns using a ball of thread provided by Ariadne, and successfully killed the Minotaur. Theseus then managed to escape the labyrinth and sailed back to Athens as a celebrated hero, and the curse of the Minotaur was finally lifted. In summary, Pasiphaë, the queen of Crete, gave birth to the Minotaur, a monstrous creature with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The Minotaur's birth was the result of a complex series of events involving deceit, divine intervention, and human folly. The creature's existence served as both a symbol of the king's hubris and a stark reminder of the consequences of angering the gods. Its death at the hands of the hero Theseus marked the end of a tragic chapter in Greek mythology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To me , he is a fourteen-year-old kid named Joe, with blond hair and blue eyes. To others, he is different. Where I see a kid who just needs a lot more attention, others see a mentally disabled boy, a kid who cannot walk or talk or think for himself. I see someone who just makes daily routine a bit less routine. Others see an annoyance, a bother. This is not to say that I have never felt resentful  toward Joe. He is my brother, and with that comes responsibility. \\"Gina, could you stay in tonight and watch your brother?\\" \\"Gina, do me a favor and feed him dinner and change his diaper  later, please?\\"\\"Could you come home right after school today and get Joe off the bus?\\" These are phrases that I have heard since I was twelve. And sure, they have made me resent my brother to a certain extent. I would think: that's not fair! Everyone else can stay after and be a member of this club, or get extra help from that teacher. Or, all my friends are going out tonight, why can't I?  And, how come I have to feed him? He is not my son! However, the small amount of resentment I feel toward my brother is erased a thousand times over by what I have learned from him. Besides making me responsible from a young age, and helping me be more accepting  of all kinds of people, he has taught me to be thankful for what I have. I know that there are moment in my life that I should cherish and that Joe will never experience. He will never laugh so hard that he cries. He will never feel the glory of a straight-A report card. He will never comfort a  best friend crying on his shoulder. And he will never know how much his family love him. Because he will never know, it is up to me to know, every second , how lucky I am. It is up to me to realize that life should be lived to its fullest, and that you should always, always be grateful that God, or whoever are the powers that be, gave you the ability to live your life the way you were meant to live it.

Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states.  - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan (  Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period .

Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto .  - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin.

Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\").  - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin.  - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan.

Background: The Cult are a British rock band formed in 1983. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s.  The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\".  When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: Did it sell very well? Answer:","output":"The Cult's self-titled album, released in October 1994, did not achieve significant commercial success. It only reached No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK charts. Although the album did peak at number one in Portugal, it quickly faded from the charts. The singles released from the album, \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" and \\"Star,\\" as well as some limited-release tracks, also did not gain substantial commercial success. Guitarist Billy Duffy even commented that he believed the record would not sell well due to its offensive lyrics. Thus, overall, the album did not sell very well, especially when compared to the band's previous releases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"It is my birthday in 1 and a bit days!\\" can be analyzed based on the textual content and the associated emotional expression. Sentiment analysis is a way of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document.  In this case, the tweet is expressing something related to a personal event that is generally considered positive and celebratory - a birthday. The author of the tweet mentioned their birthday as happening \\"in 1 and a bit days\\", indicating anticipation and positive forward planning. Consequently, the sentiment of this tweet could largely be categorized as positive. The user seems excited, probably thrilled on the occasion of their upcoming birthday. These emotions are typically associated with positive sentiments. \\"Birthday\\" instances are generally linked with celebration, pleasure, and joy, which are undeniably positive sentiments. The usage of explanation mark at the end of the tweet further strengthens the positive sentiment as it is usually associated with expressing excitement, surprise, or joy. However, without additional context or knowledge about the tweeter's personal feelings towards their birthday, we can't with absolute certainty predict the exact level of this positive sentiment. If the person enjoys their birthday, the tweet is most likely very positive. But if they do not, it could carry a more neutral or even negative sentiment. Yet, based on typical societal attitudes towards birthdays, the safe prediction would be positive sentiment. To sum it up, based on the content, tone, and context implied by this particular tweet, the sentiment can be interpreted as positive with overtones of anticipation and excitement towards the author's upcoming birthday."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the stage name of the person who joined Sabda Nada in the late 1960s? ?  Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.

Summarize this article: Obama calls Boehner, urges him to allow vote on Senate payroll tax cut bill      By Amie Parnes -      President Obama called Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, calling it \\"the only option\\" to ensure taxes don't go up.      In a phone call made late Wednesday morning, Obama urged Boehner to take up the Senate's bill, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.      In the call, Obama told the Speaker he was committed to working with Congress on extending the payroll tax for the entire year. He also reminded Boehner that \\"the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by almost the entire Senate is the only option to ensure that middle-class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution,\\" according to a White House readout.      Boehner, however, urged Obama to call on Senate Democrats to appoint negotiators to a conference committee and said Republicans remain in Washington and are “ready to work,\\" according to a readout provided by an aide to the Speaker.      “Let’s get this done today,” the Speaker told the president, the aide said.      Boehner reminded Obama that the House was the only body “that had done what he asked for by providing a full year of payroll tax relief and extended unemployment benefits.”      “He urged the President to call on Senator Reid to appoint negotiators so that we can produce a full-year bill by the end of the year that provides a tax cut of 1,000 rather than only 166,” the aide said. “The Speaker told the president that his conference was elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year.”      The differences between the House GOP and the Senate, Boehner told the president, “are not so great that we cannot pass a full-year bill by December 31st,” the aide said.            Responding to Boehner's remarks on the call, which became public in the middle of the daily press briefing, Carney stood his ground and restated the administration's position saying the \\"opportunity\\" to pass the Senate legislation \\"is there.\\"      \\"Just take it,\\" Carney said. The spokesman added that the \\"sudden insistence\\" by the Speaker to pass a one-year extension \\"doesn't ring true.\\"      Asked if there was a stalemate happening, Carney replied, \\"There is a stalemate in that the speaker will not act.\\"      Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) chimed in late in the day, rifling off a letter to Boehner urging him and the GOP conference “not to walk away from the American people again.”      “There is still time to call the House back and pass the short-term extension bill that received 89 bipartisan votes in the U.S. Senate,” Pelosi wrote. “I am hopeful that reason will prevail in your conference and that we can secure a bipartisan, long-term bill after the first of the year.”            Obama also called Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) earlier Wednesday and \\"applauded\\" him for reaching the bipartisan compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Carney said.      In that conversation, Reid \\"reaffirmed his commitment to secure a bipartisan yearlong tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension,\\" according to the White House readout.      \\"The ball is in the House's court,\\" Carney said, adding that they should \\"do the right thing and pass the bipartisan compromise.\\"      \\"They should just get it done,\\" Carney said.      Asked about Obama's plans to join his family in Hawaii, Carney said, \\"I don't have any scheduling updates to give you.\\"      Obama left the White House Wednesday afternoon for a shopping trip in Northern Virginia.      At the same time, Carney said that there would not be any more negotiating done. Obama \\"made clear\\" to Boehner that the House needs to take up the Senate bill.      \\"The negotiating has happened already,\\" Carney said. \\"It is not at all the case that the president is saying, 'Here's what I want, and do it.' \\"      — Russell Berman contributed.      — This story was last updated at 3:58 p.m.       ||||| “I have an 11- and 13-year-old at home, and I would love to be at home with them for the holidays and with my wife,” said Rep. Thomas Reed (R-N.Y.), one of the conference committee members. “But the American people deserve that we do our work and this Senate bill, 60 days, it’s just bad, reckless policy.”      Boehner appeared to shake off the scathing editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which declared that the Republicans “thoroughly botched the politics” of the payroll tax cut debate and put President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats in a better position to win reelection in 2012.      Text Size -      +      reset      “We are the party of lower taxes for the American people,” Boehner said when asked about the editorial. “We have fought for lower taxes for the 21 years that I have been in this Congress, and we will continue to be the party of lower taxes. The fact is that we can resolve the differences between the two parties and give the American people a real Christmas present.”      The Ohio Republican later added that it would be “helpful” if senators — both Republicans and Democrats — were in the Capitol to help negotiate a deal.      But there were no signs — at least publicly, that the Senate is going to help.      Several moderate Senate Republicans who are up for reelection next year have criticized House Republicans for not passing the Senate’s two-month extension. And on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined in, declaring that the tax cut fight was “harming the Republican Party.”      “It is harming the view, if it’s possible anymore, of the American people about Congress,” McCain told CNN. “And we’ve got to get this thing resolved.”      McCain also tweeted Wednesday morning that the Journal’s editorial page was “right on the mark.” And Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — who earlier this week said Reid should call the Senate back to Washington to work out a deal with House Republicans — said in a Wednesday morning television interview that the Journal editorial was “right.”      “One more public policy blunder, but just get it over with and move on because now it’s been framed as a tax increase, which it’s not,” Corker said on CNBC. “Probably at this point, the best thing to do is to figure out a way to get this behind us and move on and hopefully at some point, figure out a way to begin dealing with the real issues that our country needs to deal with.”      Clearly sensing a political advantage on the payroll tax debate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on a conference call that Boehner’s decision to block a vote on the Senate bill was “backfiring.”      “When the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has turned on the top elected Republican in the United States, that tells you something,” said Schumer, who heads the Senate Democrats’ messaging operation. “It shows how quickly the politics and the substance of this issue have turned against the speaker.”      Asked whether Democrats were engaging in partisan gamesmanship of their own, Hoyer — who earlier had called the GOP conference committee a “gimmick” and a “political charade” — pushed back.      “This is democracy,” Hoyer said. “We’re not playing a game.”      Scott Wong contributed to this report. |||||","output":"President Obama called Speaker John Boehner and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, arguing it was the only option to prevent a tax increase.

Begin by gathering the necessary ingredients and kitchen tools. You will need fresh salmon fillets, cornstarch, olive oil or butter, salt, and pepper. For kitchen tools, you'll need a non-stick frying pan, a spatula, and a plate or tray for holding the prepared fillets. 2. Start by rinsing the salmon fillets under cold water to remove any potential scales or debris. Lightly pat the fillets dry with a paper towel, making sure you don't leave any paper residue. Place the fillets on the plate or tray. 3. Holding the fish over the sink, lightly rub it down with a thin layer of cornstarch. This can also be done by lightly sprinkling the cornstarch over each fillet. Be sure to cover both sides of the fillet. Give your fish a gentle shake to remove any excess cornstarch, as the layer should be very thin. The cornstarch will help seal moisture into your fish and help form a slightly crispy exterior when cooked. 4. Season your salmon fillets with salt and pepper to taste. 5. Heat the non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a thin layer of olive oil or a small knob of butter to the pan, allowing it to melt and evenly coat the surface of the pan. 6. Once the pan is hot, carefully place the salmon fillets skin-side down into the pan. They should sizzle when they hit the pan. If the skin seems to stick, give it a minute more before trying to move the fillet, as it should release once the skin has had a chance to crisp. 7. Cook the salmon fillets for 4-5 minutes on the skin side. Once the skin is crispy and easily releases from the pan, flip the fillets over using a spatula. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side. This cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets. 8. After a total of approximately 7-8 minutes of cooking, the salmon should be opaque and easily flake apart with a fork. Remove the fillets from the pan and transfer them to a plate. 9. Serve your quick and easy salmon fillets with a side of your choice, such as a fresh salad, grilled vegetables, or a light rice dish. The fish will be perfectly cooked, moist, and slightly crispy on the outside. Enjoy your delicious meal!"},{"instruction":"Where is the nation of greece located?

Philae will be ejected towards Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by its carrier spacecraft, Rosetta, on the morning of 12 November. If successful, it will be a historic first - no probe has ever soft-landed on one of these icy bodies before. Controllers at the European Space Agency's operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, hope to get a positive signal from the robot at just after 1600 GMT (1700 CET). Until now, the chosen landing zone on the \\"head\\" of duck-shaped 67P has been known simply as \\"J\\" - a reference to its position on a list of possible destinations in the landing site selection process. The new name - Agilkia - refers to a patch of high ground in the Nile River south of Egypt. It is the place where ancient Egyptian buildings, including the famous Temple of Isis, were moved when their previous home, the island of Philae, was flooded during the building of the Aswan dams last century. Philae also refers to the obelisk taken from the drowned island which, along with the Rosetta Stone, was used to crack the meaning of ancient hieroglyphs. One hundred and fifty people suggested the name Agilkia in the competition, with a committee nominating Alexandre Brouste from France as the overall winner. Everyone who entered had to write an accompanying short essay, and his impressed the judges most. Mr Brouste will now be invited to Darmstadt's \\"mission control\\" to follow the landing event in person. Rosetta will be some 580 million km from Earth when it drops the piggybacked Philae over the comet. The descent is expected to take about seven hours. If the robot manages to latch on to the surface with screws and harpoons, it will begin a series of experiments to analyse the composition and structure of 67P.

Background: Jahlil Okafor (pronounced ; born December 15, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played his freshman season of college for the 2014-15 Duke national championship team. Okafor was heavily recruited since before high school and had been at the top of the recruiting rankings for several years. He played high school basketball in Chicago, Illinois for Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, where he earned high school national player of the year awards from McDonald's, USA Today and Parade. Context: In October 2010, he successfully tried out for USA Basketball's 2011-12 USA Developmental National Team. In June 2011, he qualified for the 12-man United States team at the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship along with Simeon rivals Parker and Nunn. In the gold medal game, Okafor made all of his field goal attempts posting 18 points and 14 rebounds. For the tournament, his 46 rebounds over 5 games ranked him second on the United States team (to Aaron Gordon) and third at the Championships in rebounding.  He was a member of USA Basketball's 12-man Team USA at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship with Parker and Nunn again. His listed height was 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m). At a two-game four-team preliminary exhibition tournament in Las Palmas, Canary Islands the week before the championship began, he was named tournament MVP. He was also named MVP of the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship for the gold medal-winning United States team. Okafor posted 17 points and 8 rebounds in the gold medal game. Over the course of the tournament, he was the second-leading scorer with 13.6 points per game and second-leading rebounder for the United States with 8.2 rebounds per game.  On May 21, 2013, USA Basketball announced the roster of 24 players, including Okafor, who had accepted invitations to the June 14-19, 2013, USA Basketball Men's U19 World Championship team training camp. The camp was used to select the 12-man team for the June 27 - July 7, 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Czech Republic. Okafor made the final roster that was announced on June 18. The team won the gold medal and Okafor made the All-Tournament team along with teammate and tournament MVP Gordon.

Review: Do not buy this book or any other \\"Bibles.\\" Spend you money on books writen by Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens,and Richard Dawkins. You will be much better off. Answer: Answer:","output":"After examining the given product review with the title \\"Religious nonsense\\" and the contents of the review, it is evident that this is a negative review. The reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with the book they are reviewing (presumably a religious text or Bible) and suggests that the reader should instead spend their money on books authored by Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins. These three authors are well-known for their critical views on religion and the promotion of atheism and secularism in their writings. There are several indicators in the review that denote a negative tone and opinion. Firstly, the title \\"Religious nonsense\\" conveys a negative sentiment and implies that the reviewer deems the content in the book to be without value or merit. Secondly, the explicit suggestion to not buy the book or any other \\"Bibles\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's negative position on the matter. Next, the comparison made by the reviewer between the religious text and the works of the aforementioned authors further supports their negative opinion, as they believe that readers will be \\"much better off\\" by opting for the latter. In general, the review does not present any positive statements or aspects about the product being discussed.

Rafael lives a very hectic lifestyle. His mother Norma (Norma Aleandro) suffers from Alzheimer's disease and he has not seen her in a year. Rafael sees his father Nino (HÃ©ctor Alterio) frequently but his friends rarely. He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in Buenos Aires, but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years.

One day, Rafael suddenly suffers a heart attack and, as he recovers in the intensive care unit, he is forced to reevaluate his life and decide his priorities. He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church. Rafael is opposed to the renewal of vows because his ailing mother will not be much of a participant. As part of his new life, he tells his much-younger girlfriend Nati that he wants some space and some freedom. At first she is hurt and tells him that he is no Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, or even Dick Watson.

The majority were built between 780 CE and 860 CE, even though the civilisation that created them existed for many centuries. Hypothesis: Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments lie on the island of Java. There were too many of them.","output":"To draw a hypothesis from the given context, let's look at the key information provided and analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify key points in the context: 1. Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments (candi) exist on the island of Java. 2. They date from the early classical period of Javanese civilisation (8th to 9th century CE). 3. The majority were built between 780 CE and 860 CE. 4. The civilisation that created them existed for many centuries. Step 2: Analyze the points for potential hypotheses: Point 1 tells us that there are many ancient stone religious monuments in Java, but it does not necessarily imply that there were \\"too many\\" of them, so drawing a hypothesis on the number of monuments being excessive would require more information or a clearer understanding of what is considered \\"too many.\\" Point 2-4 provide information about the time period and the civilisation that created these monuments, but does not provide information on the number (too many or too few) of such monuments. Step 3: Draw a hypothesis based on the above analysis: Since the context does not explicitly state that there were \\"too many\\" ancient stone religious monuments on the island of Java, the hypothesis that can be drawn from the context is not directly linked to the excessiveness of the number of monuments. A more appropriate hypothesis based on the given context may be: Hypothesis: Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments lie on the island of Java, reflecting the cultural and religious significance of the classical Javanese civilisation during the 8th to 9th century CE."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Things to Come is an historic film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the Second World War within a year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. But then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936). The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre. It is sad that, after Things to Come, Sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001:A Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in Hollywood.  Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. Massey plays a great \\"Doctor Who\\"-like role as a pilot from an advanced (for 1970) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline. Perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of Intolerance, actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot, but I felt more could have been made of the material, and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting. Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel? Things to Come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is a mix of both positive and negative.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  I am facing a new situation today: John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would patient B see nearby objects clearer or blurrier than patient A? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation provided, patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A.  To understand why this is the case, let's review the information about hyperopia mentioned in the background article. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, is a condition where an individual can see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. This occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal, causing images to be focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. Convex lenses can be used to correct hyperopia by focusing the images farther forward in the eye, allowing them to fall on the retina and produce a clear image. Now, let's consider the new situation with John, the ophthalmologist, and his two patients. Patient A has been diagnosed with hyperopia, which means they have difficulty viewing nearby objects clearly, causing these objects to appear blurry. On the other hand, patient B does not have any issues with their eyes, suggesting that their vision is normal and they can see both distant and nearby objects clearly. Consequently, patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A because patient B does not have hyperopia and can therefore view objects at close range without blurriness. Patient A, who has hyperopia, would require corrective lenses or other interventions to achieve the same clarity for nearby objects as patient B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances.  Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. But the film floats because of the actors and the script. I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years--on both occasions with the name \\"Brotherly love\\". \\"Country dance\\" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Which British liner was sunk by a German submarine in 1915?","output":"The British liner that was sunk by a German submarine in 1915 was the RMS Lusitania. The sinking of the Lusitania is a significant event in maritime history, as it played a crucial role in influencing public opinion during World War I and contributed to the United States' decision to enter the conflict. Launched in 1906, the RMS Lusitania was an ocean liner operated by the Cunard Line. The ship was built by John Brown and Company at its shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. The Lusitania, alongside its sister ship RMS Mauretania, was known for its speed and elegance. The vessel was designed to carry a total of 2,198 passengers and 850 crew members and boasted a range of luxurious facilities. In the early stages of World War I, Germany faced a naval blockade implemented by the British Royal Navy. The blockade limited Germany's access to essential resources and supplies, which in turn caused severe economic and social repercussions. German U-boats – submarines – were deployed to counteract the blockade and target both military and civilian vessels. On May 7, 1915, the RMS Lusitania, captained by William Thomas Turner, was on a voyage from New York to Liverpool. The ship was carrying 1,959 passengers and crew members, along with a cargo that included munitions and other military supplies for the British war effort. As the Lusitania approached the southern coast of Ireland, it was spotted by a German U-boat, the U-20, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger. The U-20 fired a single torpedo, which struck the Lusitania on its starboard side. The impact triggered a secondary explosion within the ship, causing considerable damage. The vessel began to list and sink rapidly. As a result, lifeboats were either unreachable or capsized when they hit the water, and many passengers and crew members ended up in the frigid ocean water. The Lusitania sank in less than 18 minutes, with 1,198 people losing their lives in this tragic event. This included 128 American passengers, sparking outrage in the United States. The rapid sinking of the ship is attributed to the explosion of the ship's cargo of munitions, a fact that the British government denied during the investigations that followed. The sinking of the RMS Lusitania became a significant propaganda tool for both Britain and Germany. The British government used it to gather support from neutral countries like the United States, emphasizing the German attack on civilians and noncombatants. Germany, on the other hand, defended its actions stating that it had issued warnings to the civilians through the American newspapers not to board the Lusitania. Initially, the United States pursued diplomatic efforts to address the loss of American lives, and President Woodrow Wilson sent a series of notes to the German government, demanding reparations and an end to submarine warfare against non-military vessels. Germany agreed to modify its naval strategy, temporarily calming the situation. However, the sinking of the Lusitania did have long-term effects on the American public's sentiment towards Germany and played a part in the United States' decision to enter the war in 1917, following Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the disclosure of the Zimmermann Telegram. The tragic case of the RMS Lusitania remains a stark reminder of the devastating effects of warfare on civilian lives and the power of public opinion during times of global conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hindsholm was incorporated into the new Odense County while the bulk of the former province was merged with Tranekær County and renamed to Svendborg County . Hindsholm was incorporated into the new Odense county , while the majority of the former province was merged with Tranekær County and was renamed to Svendborg County . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these sentences convey the same meaning, although with some slight differences in phrasing. Both sentences indicate that Hindsholm was incorporated into the new Odense County, while the majority of the former province was merged with Tranekær County, resulting in the renaming to Svendborg County.  To further break down the similarities and differences between the sentences, let's examine each of their components: 1. Both sentences begin with the mention of \\"Hindsholm,\\" indicating that it is an integral part of the subject:    - In the first sentence: \\"Hindsholm was incorporated...\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"Hindsholm was incorporated...\\" 2. The next section of both sentences describes the incorporation into the new Odense County:    - In the first sentence: \\"...into the new Odense County...\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"...into the new Odense county...\\"    Note that the only difference here is the capitalization of \\"County\\" in the second sentence, which is a minor detail and doesn't impact the overall meaning. 3. The \\"while\\" conjunction is used in both sentences to provide context on what happened to the rest of the former province:    - In the first sentence: \\"...while the bulk of the former province...\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"...while the majority of the former province...\\"    Both \\"bulk\\" and \\"majority\\" imply the same thing – a substantial or main part of the former province. 4. The final portion of the sentences indicates the merging with Tranekær County and renaming to Svendborg County:    - In the first sentence: \\"...was merged with Tranekær County and renamed to Svendborg County.\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"...was merged with Tranekær County and was renamed to Svendborg County.\\"    The extra \\"was\\" in the second sentence may make it seem slightly different, but it does not alter the intended meaning of the sentence. In conclusion, both sentences convey that Hindsholm became a part of the new Odense County and that the former province's remaining territory merged with Tranekær County before being renamed to Svendborg County. Despite the slight variations in phrasing and punctuation, the overall meaning remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Author E. L. James arrives for the screening of the movie 'Fifty Shades of Grey' at the 65th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin February 11, 2015.      NEW YORK E.L. James, the British author of the hugely successful \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" erotic novels, is celebrating the fictional birthday of her famous male character on Thursday with the release of her new book, \\"Grey,\\" which looks set to be an instant bestseller.      Publisher Vintage Books said demand for the novel, told from the viewpoint of business tycoon Christian Grey, has been consistent with the other books in the trilogy, which have sold more than 125 million copies worldwide.      Vintage, a division of Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, plans to have 1 million copies ready for sale in bookstores on Thursday.      \\"Grey\\" has been the top Kindle pre-order book of 2015 on Amazon, and sales are expected to soar when the ebook is released at midnight on Wednesday. The book will also be published in Britain and in audio and Spanish-language versions.      \\"It is the highest pre-order of the year,\\" said Sara Nelson, editorial director at Amazon.com. \\"I would be very surprised if it is not a bestseller.\\"      \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is the all-time best-selling Kindle title.      James announced the surprise launch of the book earlier this month in one of the best-kept secrets of publishing. She was prompted to write it by fans who had asked her to tell Grey's side of the story of his erotic relationship with virginal college student Anastasia Steele.      \\"Christian is a complex character,\\" James said when she announced the book's release date on the Instagram social media network, \\"and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations.\\"      Grey is a handsome, 27-year-old self-made billionaire with a troubled past who lives and works in an ordered world that becomes unsettled when he meets Steele and introduces her to kinky sex, sadomasochism and bondage.      In \\"Grey\\" James will give her millions of avid fans Grey's take on his relationship with Steele and his thoughts and insights.      \\"Books like this always have an appeal,\\" said Amazon.com's Nelson.      The first book of the trilogy was turned into an R-rated film by Comcast Corp-owned Universal Pictures starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, grossing more than 500 million at the global box office since its February release.      Several countries, including India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya, banned the film from their theaters because of its erotic content. Critics said the movie blurred the lines between healthy and harmful sex.      Film adaptations of the second and third books are also planned. ||||| EL James’ new book Grey is the raunchiest yet.      It tells the love story from the kinky mind of power-hungry heartthrob Christian Grey.      In the first review of Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey - as told by Christian - one thing is clear: there’s absolutely nothing vanilla about this book.      After weeks of breathless anticipation, Fifty Shades of Grey fans are today at last able to get their hands on a copy of E L James’ saucy new sequel.      The wait alone has had fans in a fluster.      Suspense was so great that Kent Police were even called in over fears one of the manuscripts had been stolen last week.      But the Mirror finally got their hands on one of the very first copies - and say it’s definitely worth the palm-twitching wait.      Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan attending the UK premiere of Fifty Shades of Grey      The original Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy tells the tale of attractive-but-troubled billionaire Christian Grey who woos innocent student Ana Steele into his adventurous world of S&M.      The trilogy sold 125 million copies worldwide since 2011, was translated into 51 languages, revolutionised countless sex lives, and transformed Jamie Dornan into Hollywood’s hottest man with the movie making £318m at the box office.      Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire Sam Taylor-Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Dakota Johnson and E L James attending the UK premiere      James’ characteristic internal monologues provide a direct line into Christian’s mind, revealing his deepest, darkest desires... and they don’t disappoint.      Ana’s self-deprecating irony, her timidity and – later - her growing self-assurance in the face of overbearing Christian were what made us fall in love with her in the first three books.      REAL LIFE LOVE: Dakota Johnson and her Welsh boyfriend look back on track      But Christian has no problem naming exactly what he wants and how he wants to do it. “She can’t even say ‘f***’ or sex,” he observes in the early pages of this new novel.      Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey      The book continues in this harder, coarser, more direct attitude, putting paid to any criticism that books are “light” erotica or “mummy porn”.      And in case we didn’t guess already, Christian Grey is a man who isn’t afraid of strong language and his fantasies - shared in all their explicit details - spell out exactly what he’s after.      Most are too rude to repeat in a family newspaper, but to give you an idea, in one mundane conversation, Christian breaks off to share a daydream about Ana, a “peeled ginger root” - that’s definitely not being used for cooking - and her being “shackled” to his bench. You get the picture.      The cover of the new book      But it’s not just Christian’s dirty mind that’s being exposed in Grey.      For the first time we find ourselves privy to his emotions.      The story is punctuated with dreams and flashbacks alluding to his troubled childhood and the nightmares he still suffers. Through these, and his attempts to analyse his feelings for Anastasia Steele , we learn that he is caught in a constant battle with his insecurities.      Try as he might, he can’t suppress the conviction that deep down, he doesn’t deserve to be loved.      And as we suspected from the first trilogy, it’s really because he’s frightened of his own strong feelings, he turns to BDSM as a means of “taming” his desires.      Ana and Christian      MORE: If Fifty Shades of Grey had been set in Wales      “Maybe this will stop if I fetter, f***, and flog her,” he says of his growing affection for Ana.      Grey shows a development from the previous books in more ways than one. While action-hungry fans will be thrilled by the more graphic sex scenes, romance lovers will finally get the answers they’ve been craving.      Fifty Shades of Grey author E L James      In peeping into the mind of the mysterious Mr Grey, we learn that his desire for her submission is less about his own control as it is wanting to be loved and trusted, and accepted.      Does that make him less attractive? Hell no. In fact I think we’re all about to fall just a little bit more in love... ||||| The fourth book in EL James’ erotic series is told from the male protagonist’s point of view, taking us beyond the red room to Christian Grey’s f-f-f-feelings      Christian has some serious childhood issues            But we knew that already, right? The fourth novel of the bestselling erotica series of all time – wait, make that the bestselling ebook on Kindle full stop – opens with a dream sequence featuring three toy cars and Grey’s anatomy, I mean Mommy. It reads like a Ladybird book. Even Christian is confused when he wakes up. “What the hell was that about?” he asks himself, in a possible foreshadowing of reader reactions.      New Fifty Shades of Grey novel puts Christian Grey centre stage Read more      But he may have good reason to be messed up      No spoilers here. Suffice to say that Christian’s “crack whore” mother, as he referred to her in the earlier books, does have a dark past.      Christian can Facebook stalk with the best of us      Before he visits Anastasia Steele at the Portland hardware store where she works, he confesses to having run a “background check” to find out whether she’s attached. “I’m now behaving like a stalker,” he has the good grace to admit. But where does his mind jump when he discovers there’s no boyfriend? “Sexual orientation unknown – perhaps she’s gay.”      The billionaire does have a charitable conscience      While there’s always been a Chandler Bing vibe to Christian (does anyone actually know what he actually does in his job?), the fourth book continues to plug his charity work. There are no fewer than 11 mentions of “the Darfur project” in Grey. Believe us. We searched for them. Ebooks are handy like that.      Christian Grey resolves to ‘fetter, fuck and flog’ his new love interest. Photograph: PR      Christian’s internal monologue is alliterative      In an attempt to beat down his growing fuzzy feelings for Anastasia, he wonders: “Maybe this will stop if I fetter, fuck and flog her ... and not necessarily in that order.” Who doesn’t like a good F word, eh?      He really, really hates the housemate      We know Ana’s mate Kate is none too keen on her friend’s fella, but in Grey we learn just how mutual that disdain really is. “Fuck you, Kavanagh” is the least of it. The words “persistent”, “tenacious” and “shrieking like a harpy” come up a LOT.      EL James has not given up on love (of cliches)            “Anastasia, I’ve told you. There’s something about you. I can’t leave you alone. I’m like a moth to a flame.” Despite some literary crossover in terms of sex-crazed male protagonists, we take it Martin Amis is probably not a James fan.      She had no choice about writing this novel. Or did she?      “This book is dedicated to those readers who asked … and asked … and asked … and asked for this,” writes the author in the acknowledgements of Grey. “You rocked my world.” Has James taken Anastasia’s submissive tendencies to heart? We live in an an age where it’s OK to say no, Erica. ||||| FILE - This file image provided by Vintage Books shows the cover of the new book, \\"Grey,\\" the fourth novel in E L James' multimillion-selling \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" erotic series. The book is releasing... (Associated Press)      How her pale, flawless skin might look \\"pink and warmed from the bite of a cane,\\" of course. And that's only page five of the fan-anticipated \\"Grey,\\" out Thursday from EL James and her grateful imprint, Vintage Books.      Starting with a nightmare flashing back to Grey's rough childhood, James soon gets down to BDSM business as she plows through the familiar story laid out in her first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" only this time she tells it from the hunky billionaire's perspective rather than that of the young and innocent Ana.      Flip just a couple more pages and Christian considers correcting Ana's now-famous clumsiness with the aid of a riding crop after she stumbles into his Seattle office to interview him for her college newspaper. Then he lusts after her inviting mouth after she does one of those things she's also known for: biting her lower lip in a way that drives him lustily nuts — nuts to punish her, that is.      The new book was requested by fans, James said when she announced June 1 that \\"Grey\\" not only existed but would be out soon after — the book is being released worldwide at midnight local time on Thursday, timed to coincide with Grey's birthday. And she had mentioned in appearances as long ago as 2012 that she wanted to explore what turned into a massively popular erotic trilogy from Grey's point of view.      James teased readers with a chapter featuring Grey's narration at the end of her third book, \\"Fifty Shades Freed,\\" and she had written through his eyes in 2010, as part of her episodic \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction when Grey was still Edward Cullen and James was still known as Snowqueens Icedragon.      The new book is bereft of any true surprises, like so many other add-ons, but that won't matter much too hard-core fans of this hard-core romance franchise.      In 2011, the trilogy's first volume set off a frenzy that had literati laughing at the former TV producer's writing skills but readers buying and sharing copies like crazy. In all, the three books sold more than 125 million copies around the world and spawned the first movie starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, with at least two more planned.      After the movies, do we really need Grey's little interior asides, \\"Maybe this could work,\\" for example? Is there anything we don't know about him already?      He frets as he navigates his paranoid jealousy that other, younger boys in Ana's life might want her, too. He frets that she wants vanilla sex, rather than the kind involving implements in the playroom of his mansion. And he frets as he — the needy, damaged sex dominant — realizes it's been too long between submissives.      Grey's self-loathing comes alive in predictable expletives — and predictable cliches as realizes his pull to Ana is \\"like a moth to a flame.\\"      Meanwhile, in the Fifty fandom, \\"Grey\\" is the No. 1 pre-order of the year so far for Amazon's Kindle, though Harper Lee's \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" is tops for pre-orders on paper. And according to reports Down Under, frenzied fans in New Zealand were the first to get their hands on the book.      James' scheduled whereabouts when the book lands Thursday is a stop to sign copies in New York at a Barnes & Noble store.      Back on the British writer's freshest pages, our new narrator marvels at Ana's, er, oral skills after he relieves her of her virginity through traditional sex that he, too, has never experienced.

Background: Sitting Bull was born on land later included in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or \\"Slow,\\" said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included his father and his uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Context: From 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud as a leader of the Oglala Lakota fought against US forces, attacking their forts in an effort to keep control of the Powder River Country of Montana. In support of him, Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868. Sitting Bull also made guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.  By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that the US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out on behalf of the government: \\"I wish all to know that I do not propose to sell any part of my country.\\" He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.  The events of 1866-1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralized. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions, including whether to wage war. Question: Was there any specific land areas they were fighting for? Answer:","output":"Yes, during the period of 1866-1868, the land areas Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, and their respective tribes were primarily fighting for were the Powder River Country of Montana and the surrounding upper Missouri River region. They sought to retain control over their territory from the encroachment of U.S. forces and emigrant parties who were establishing forts, settlements, and infrastructure in these areas. The Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 was an attempt by the U.S. government to establish a peaceful settlement, but Sitting Bull did not agree to its terms and continued his opposition to forces in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thousands upon thousands of novels were published. Of those novels, very few are remembered today. However, there are exceptions  ; the works of Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility - for example. They achieved only modest success at first but grew and grew in fame  and reputation. How did Jane Austen become so popular? Of course, the novels are romantic. Everyone knows the love story of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett (in Pride and Prejudice), and how they overcome their own pride and prejudice to live happily ever after. The lovers are almost as famous today as Romeo and Juliet. But there is more to Austen's popularity than the fact that she wrote about love. The books are very witty   and ironic  , and show a great understanding of society and of people. Pride and Prejudice opens with what must be the most famous sentence in the English novel: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" The truth, of course, is the opposite: wealthy, unmarried young men are extremely attractive to young women. And women - especially penniless or near-penniless ones - are the subjects of Austen's tales. Women nowadays may be more equal to men than they were in Jane Austen's day. However, a sense that women still basically live in a world dominated   by men ensures that Austen still has many keen readers.

But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family.

Movie title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Context: On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

Ratt is an American heavy metal band that had significant commercial success in the 1980s, with their albums having been certified as gold, platinum, and multi-platinum by the RIAA. The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"You're in Love\\" and \\"Dance\\". The self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of Atlantic Records which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. Out of the Cellar was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent Van Halen and Aerosmith-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, staccato guitar-picking style of Judas Priest. Tawny Kitaen, who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \\"Back for More\\" and on their EP from the previous year.  The album scored much radio and MTV play with songs like \\"Round and Round\\" (which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart), \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"Back for More\\", and \\"Lack of Communication\\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. Milton Berle's guest appearance, dressed in his Uncle Miltie drag character, in the video for \\"Round and Round\\" helped draw even more attention to the band.  Out of the Cellar became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as Billy Squier, Ozzy Osbourne, Blackfoot, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Twisted Sister and Lita Ford. Out of the Cellar is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 80s heavy metal, while \\"Round and Round\\" scored at No. 61 on VH1's Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show.

Christopher has now pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences. 30-year-old was jailed for five years at Guildford Crown Court this week. Article:","output":"Title: 30-Year-Old Epsom Resident Sentenced to Five Years in Jail Over Drug and Firearm Possession Subtitle: Police Discover Drugs Stashed in Kinder Surprise Eggs and Guns with Ammunition In an unprecedented crackdown against drug peddlers and illegal firearms holders, Surrey Police carried out a raid in Epsom, Surrey, leading to the arrest and sentencing of 30-year-old Warren Christopher. He has now been jailed for five years after pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences at Guildford Crown Court. The police operation took place in August, targeting Warren Christopher's residence in Epsom, releasing the information this week. The raid led to the discovery of illegal drugs hidden in an unusual and unsuspecting manner - inside colourful Kinder Surprise eggs. Besides the drugs, an array of firearms and ammunition were also confiscated from Christopher's home. Warren Christopher's decision to hide the drugs in the children's confectionery raised concerns, as this tactic could have far-reaching consequences for unsuspecting children who might come into contact with their toxic, unlawful contents. Following the raid, Christopher was charged with seven offences related to drug and firearm possession. The evidence against him was substantial due to the illicit arsenal uncovered during the search of his residence. On trial at Guildford Crown Court this week, Christopher pleaded guilty to all seven offences. The court sentenced him to a five-year prison term. This lengthy incarceration will serve as a lesson not only to Christopher but also to others involved in such illegal activities, sending a strong message that the authorities will not stand for drug dealing and firearm possession. The successful operation by Surrey Police demonstrates their commitment to upholding the law and keeping the community safe from such threats. This case, in particular, highlights the dangers of drugs, not only their circulation but also their devastating potential influence on young lives. Parents and guardians must continue to educate children about the risks of drug use and be vigilant about any suspicious food items or containers in their children's possession. Cases like these are a stark reminder that criminal intent can infiltrate the most seemingly innocent places. In conclusion, the arrest and sentencing of Warren Christopher serve as a testament to the continuous efforts of the Surrey Police in dismantling criminal networks and safeguarding the wellbeing of the community. The five-year jail term sends a strong signal that drug and firearm offences will not be dealt with leniently, and offenders will face the full force of the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

News article: Virginia’s first hemp crop in decades could signal new opportunity RICHMOND — Marty Phipps started a business this year selling an innovative type of bedding for horses and small animals — a shredded substance that absorbs liquids, resists microbes and cuts down on smell. But because the product is made with hemp, which is the same plant species as marijuana and is tightly controlled by the government, Phipps has to import it from Europe. He figures his costs are double what they would be if hemp were an ordinary crop grown locally. Virginia has joined a nationwide movement to change that equation. This year, for the first time in about 70 years, a group of Virginia farmers harvested a small crop of hemp. It was permitted strictly for research, but a growing chorus — including politicians on the left and right — is pushing to cash in on a versatile crop that can be put to thousands of commercial uses and bring back lost jobs. “It’s pretty ridiculous, actually,” that it’s taken this long, said Del. Joseph R. Yost, a Republican from Blacksburg who sponsored a bill in last year’s General Assembly to set up the hemp research program. “I represent a rural area in the southwest, and it’s viewed as possibly something that could help replace the tobacco industry and manufacturing industry.” Yost’s bill, and a companion measure on the state Senate side, passed unanimously. Another bill this year endorsed the industrial use of hemp. Three universities signed up to participate in the research program — Virginia Tech, James Madison and Virginia State — and the University of Virginia has joined for next year. Each school got seeds, which had to be ordered from European countries and then cleared by federal inspectors. Everyone involved with the research, professors and farmers alike, had to go through federal background checks to handle what is considered a controlled substance. Drug Enforcement Administration agents inspected the state’s seed laboratory. The teams planted about 37 acres on plots in six counties in June, then harvested it in October. Each university sent the state detailed reports of their findings, but the bottom line was pretty straightforward. “Overall, I think the researchers have a positive outlook on hemp’s potential in Virginia,” said Erin Williams, senior policy analyst for the state agriculture department. This is not to be confused with marijuana’s potential in Virginia, which is much slimmer. Hemp and marijuana plants look the same, but hemp has far less of the chemical — tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — that gives marijuana users a high. Experts say you would never plant the two together because they would cross-pollinate, and THC levels would plummet in the pot. Plus hemp is cultivated for its seeds; pot growers prefer that the plants put their energy into creating buds, not seeds. People get confused about the difference. Phipps, for instance, was making a delivery with his father in Loudoun County when a car full of young guys pulled up next to their truck. Seeing the name of the Charlottesville-based business painted on the side — Old Dominion Hemp — “these guys start saluting me and giving high-fives out the window,” Phipps said. “And my Dad’s like, ‘They kind of don’t realize this is animal bedding, do they?’ ” He would argue that federal law is similarly confused, that hemp does not belong in the same category as marijuana. It took a special provision in the 2014 federal farm bill to permit states to allow academic research of hemp cultivation. Now two bills are pending in Congress that would open the door to full-fledged agricultural and industrial use. Those bills have powerful supporters. Both Republican senators from Kentucky, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, have urged passage. And Kentucky has been especially aggressive about exploiting the federal research loophole to rapidly expand cultivation, with almost 4,500 acres in production this year. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who represents the Harrisonburg area, has visited JMU’s research site and favors expansion. “Now it is time to move from research to commercial production in the United States,” he said. But Virginia supporters worry that the bluegrass state is getting a head start. “We could be way more aggressive the way Kentucky is being aggressive,” said Jason Amatucci, founder and executive director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition. Colorado is going even further, he said, challenging federal law by cultivating not just hemp but marijuana. “But Virginia does not choose to take that risk,” he said. Amatucci, 41, learned about hemp while working in his family’s boxwood business, which is based in Charlottesville. He formed the coalition in 2012 after becoming alarmed about the state of agriculture in Virginia. About 90 percent of Virginia farms are owned by individuals or families, but the average age for farmers is nearly 60, according to state data. As old cash crops such as tobacco continue to decline, owners of small farms need alternatives to thrive and to bring in new generations, Amatucci said. “We’re just trying to get hemp to be an option,” he said. After all, there’s already a booming market for hemp products. Americans spend more than 580 million annually on hemp-based goods, according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service. Hemp is used in a variety of products, including fabrics, paper, construction materials, automobile parts and nutritional supplements. Much of the consumer money goes outside U.S. borders — hemp is an established crop in more than 30 other countries, according to the CRS report. It wasn’t always this way, of course. Hemp was a crucial product in Colonial-era America, where it was used in sails, rope, clothing, paper and other items. Supporters love to haul out quotes from Thomas Jefferson and other luminaries about the virtues of hemp. It was cultivated in this country through World War II but fell victim to postwar drug enforcement. The efforts to revive the crop in Virginia are somewhat ironic, said Yost, who aside from being a delegate is the executive director of the Giles County Historical Society. In 1619, the Virginia colony passed a law requiring farmers to grow hemp. “Hopefully, it’s making a comeback,” Yost said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"In Virginia, farmers have harvested a small crop of hemp for the first time in about 70 years. Although the crop was permitted strictly for research purposes, there is a growing movement to allow more widespread cultivation of hemp, which is related to marijuana but has a much lower content of the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Hemp can be used for thousands of commercial applications, and could help replace lost jobs in areas such as tobacco farming. Virginia is among a number of US states experimenting with cultivating hemp crops again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech.Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. \\"We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,\\" one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother.While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead - but not just ones... The answer to this question is:","output":"David Murch's job in the movie \\"Homecoming\\" is a speech writer for the unnamed US president who is running for re-election during a divisive war.

Q1: Who was director of the museum featuring the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy? A:","output":"The final exam question pertains to the director of a specific museum featuring the last sail-only warship. To answer this question thoroughly, it is essential to identify the exact warship being referred to. It's crucial to clarify that the USS Constitution is the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy which is still in existence, she is also the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world. The USS Constitution is located in Boston, in the Charlestown Navy Yard, part of the Boston National Historical Park, and it is managed in partnership between the National Park Service and the United States Navy. Therefore, one could argue that the museum is managed by both entities, meaning there technically would be two people in charge – the superintendent of the Boston National Historical Park (responsible for the area the ship is located in) and the commanding officer of the USS Constitution (responsible for the vessel itself). The last recorded superintendent of the Boston National Historical Park was Michael Creasey. However, specific up-to-date knowledge can vary as positions often change over time and may be different today. As for the USS Constitution, she is still on the active roster of the US Navy, hence having a commanding officer. The commanding officer of the USS Constitution is traditionally a U.S. Navy Commander. As of this writing, the 76th commanding officer is Commander John Benda. However, the USS Constitution Museum, an adjunct and independently funded organization to the Historic Ship USS Constitution, has its own president. As of the time of writing, the president is Anne Grimes Rand. Given the nature of the question, it's difficult to pin down one individual who is the 'director' of the museum, as the duties referred to are spread across several entities and, therefore, several individuals. Therefore, the correct answer could be Michael Creasey or Commander John Benda or Anne Grimes Rand, depending on the exact context the question is being asked in.

The decor looked nicer than the furniture because the   a). decor in the house was old.; b). furniture in the house was old.;","output":"The decor looked nicer than the furniture because the furniture in the house was old. In this sentence, the comparison is made between the decor and the furniture of the house. The sentence aims to convey that the decor appears more visually appealing when compared to the furniture. The reason for this difference in appearance is given as the age of the furniture, which implies that it may be showing signs of wear, damage, or outdated style. Taking a more in-depth look at the elements involved in the sentence, we can observe the following: 1. Decor: The decor refers to the decorative elements that contribute to the overall visual appeal and styling of a space. These elements may include artwork, wall coverings, window treatments, lighting fixtures, and accessories. The decor often sets the atmosphere and mood of a space, reflecting the taste and preferences of the occupants. In the given sentence, the decor is characterized as \\"nicer,\\" which implies that it has a more pleasant and attractive appearance. This may be influenced by various factors, such as the colors, patterns, textures, and arrangement of the decorative pieces. 2. Furniture: The furniture refers to the movable items—such as chairs, tables, and cabinets—that fill a space and serve various practical functions. Furniture design can also be an essential aspect of the overall interior styling, as it can define the style, comfort, and utility of the space. In this sentence, the furniture is described as being \\"old,\\" which could indicate a few different things. It may mean that the furniture pieces were acquired a long time ago and have since become worn, damaged, or faded. Alternatively, it could imply that the furniture is of a dated design or style, incongruous with the current trends and preferences. Either way, the age of the furniture detracts from its aesthetic appeal, making it less visually pleasing compared to the decor. To summarize, the sentence ends with, \\"the furniture in the house was old,\\" as this part effectively explains the rationale behind the perceived difference in the appearance of the decor and the furniture. The decor, with its visually pleasing characteristics, is deemed nicer than the old, tired, or outdated furniture, creating a contrast between the two elements within the house."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Was the water table in increased or decreased level in northeast Michigan during sixteenth century?  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. A:","output":"In the sixteenth century, the water table in northeast Michigan would have been at a decreased level compared to the twentieth century. This is because, as mentioned in the information provided, the clearing of vegetation and the introduction of heavy irrigation in the twentieth century led to an increase in the water table and mobilization of salts.

Therefore, the best answer would be 'Business'.  In contrast, 'Sports' is not a suitable choice since the text does not discuss any athletic or sporting activities. Similarly, 'Science/Tech' doesn't apply because, although the oil industry can involve scientific and technological elements, these are not the focus of the provided text.

You don't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be. Girls know it too. Megan Fox plays a demonic cheerleader in \\"Jennifer's Body,\\" written by Diablo \\"Juno\\" Cody. Certainly Diablo Cody does. The Academy Award-winning \\"Juno\\" scribe proves as much in her second screenplay, a horror comedy about BFFs Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried). These bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox. They're inseparable opposites: Jennifer is a babe, head cheerleader and a bit of a snot. Needy is nerdy, conventional and a soft touch. Except that when we first meet her, she's locked up in the local mental hospital, kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here. Looking back, she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day Jennifer talked her into seeing an up-and-coming indie band at the roadhouse. The gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates, then Jennifer drives off with the band for an al fresco after-party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice. She survives on a technicality, but shows up later that night at Needy's place covered in blood, barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh. In the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress. Only Jennifer seems unfazed by the community's second sucker punch: the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods. What's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy-eating demon? Needy cleans up the mess and hopes it's just a phase. The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was \\"Twilight,\\" which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller. Directed by Karyn Kusama, who made \\"Girlfight\\" and \\"Aeon Flux,\\" \\"Jennifer's Body\\" isn't anything like that. It's a much edgier, snappier, bloodier film, aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty. (That's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience, surely?) So smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue, Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even Needy is not immune to her charms. Ironically, though, Jennifer is really the needy one here, while her friend eventually finds the self-possession to stand up to her. Similarly, you might come for Fox, but it's Amanda Seyfried's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression. The \\"Mamma Mia\\" starlet is destined for good things. iReport.com: Share your review of \\"Jennifer's Body\\" The bitingly smart, funny teen-speak is carried over from \\"Juno,\\" along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude, but the million-dollar question has to be: Is it scary?

The gore scenes come with weird little flourishes: Jennifer's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures, sounding a sweetly sick echo of \\"Bambi,\\" and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool (don't they drain those things?). But the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror. I suspect the film will prove too freaky for \\"Juno\\" boosters, and could have used more straight-ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks.

Using a linoleum block, you can make a nice stamp with your initials. You should be able to find all the tools for this stamp in a craft store.  Sketch out your monogram or design it in a word-processing program. Trace a pencil over your printed monogram, then lay it face down on a linoleum block. Scribble over the block to transfer those pencil lines to the block. Use a linoleum knife to cut the shape into the block (deep, but not all the way through), then cut the monogram out of the block to create a stamp. Placing a picture or photograph on the front of a card can make more personal, especially if the picture has some meaning to both you and the recipient. Print out a picture of your choosing, and glue it to the front of a card.  Your picture can be on any type of paper you would like, though you may want to avoid high quality glossy photo paper, especially if you are making a lot of cards, as it can be quite expensive. You can also add the look of a frame to your pictures by cutting out some colored paper and placing that underneath your picture. Different colors or adding more than one border gives you some flexibility in designs. Just make sure your picture doesn’t take up the entire front of your card so there is room for the border. Using bright green leaves you can find in nature, you can add a natural look to paper. Place the leaf on your paper with a lightweight white paper towel on top. Gently hammer the spot where the leaf is until you see the green soak through the paper towel. Pull off the towel, gentle remove the leaf from the paper, and let it dry. There are many different leaves out there which will give you many different kinds of greens. Go ahead and experiment with different types until you get a shade and shape that you like. To add a touch of color, you can add small squares of fabric to the front of your cards. Cut out a square of fabric, making sure it is not bigger than your actual card. Stich it to the card using  sewing machine or  sewing by hand. This will probably give you a bunch of cards that all look slightly different, rather than being uniform, unless you have a lot of some kind of fabric. This can also be a good way to get rid of excess fabric without just throwing it away. You can also add some slight scents to make your card stand out and be a pleasant surprise for the recipient. Take some cotton pads, and add a few drops of a scent you like, such as scented oils or perfume. Put the cotton pads at the bottom of a plastic container, then cover the pads with a piece of cardstock. Spread your stationary on top of the cardstock and close the top for 24 hours. You can repeat by adding more oil to the cotton pads to get a stronger scent. The cardstock is important because you don’t want the oils to get directly on your paper and damage it. All you want is the smell, not the liquid.","output":"This article explains how to personalize stationary through techniques such as creating a linoleum block stamp with initials, adding meaningful photos, incorporating natural elements like leaves, attaching fabric squares, and infusing paper with pleasant scents."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more.

House of the Week | Great Falls manor for 6.5M Years ago, when the owner of this home in Great Falls visited the Homewood Museum on the campus of Johns Hopkins University, the national historic landmark made such an impression on him that it was his inspiration when he designed his home. Homewood Museum, which was built in 1801 by Charles Carroll Jr., is one of the nation’s best-surviving examples of Federal-period architecture, and that style is reflected in this 2004 manor. A wide stone driveway leads up to a stately portico with Corinthian columns and a limestone floor. A copper roof with brass snow birds, an elegant cornice and 11-foot double-hung windows with redwood shutters complete the magnificent facade. The evening rooms — the sumptuous library and formal dining room — are in the front of the house, an ideal placement for formal entertaining. The day rooms — the living room, family room and kitchen — are in the rear, which receives the most sunlight. “When you spend some time there, you are very comfortable,” said listing agent Bay Buchanan of McEnearney Associates. (Buchanan — a former U.S. treasurer, manager of older brother Pat’s three presidential campaigns and conservative commentator — made a career pivot a year ago and became a real estate agent.) The house “overwhelms you the first time you are there. But once you’re in the rooms, it’s very warm, very inviting. It’s a very livable, very friendly place.” For such a grand home, it has an unusual layout. Four of the bedrooms, including the master suite, are on the main level. The master bedroom and family room have glass conservatories attached to them. There’s also a sun room that’s drenched in natural light from the skylights. The spacious kitchen has an ornate tin ceiling, a feature that’s also incorporated into the bar downstairs. The 4,200-square-foot lower level is large enough that “you could have a daggone touch football game” there, Buchanan said. The wine cellar has room to store a vineyard’s worth of wine. The flat, five-acre lot abounds in trees and shrubbery, making the grounds well suited for outdoor entertaining. A 1,300-square-foot apartment above the four-car garage can be used for staff quarters or an in-law suite. The five-bedroom, 10-bathroom house is listed at 6.5 million.

They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power.  Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil?  Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Answer:","output":"Considering the situation of Bobby and Ned's gardens, it is clear that Ned's garden is currently experiencing flooding, while Bobby's garden remains unflooded. Based on the hint provided, we know that the diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is significantly slower in water than in air, which ultimately leads to hypoxic or anoxic conditions in the soil. Under such conditions, anaerobic bacteria thrive, especially among the roots. In Ned's garden, the flooding leads to a lower availability of oxygen, providing an ideal environment for anaerobic bacteria to multiply and prosper. These bacteria utilize alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds when oxygen is scarce, thereby altering the soil chemistry. On the other hand, Bobby's garden is not flooded, indicating better oxygen availability in the soil, which hampers the growth of anaerobic bacteria. In this case, the soil microorganisms use oxygen during respiration when the soil is drier. Thus, aerobic bacteria would dominate Bobby's garden, keeping the anaerobic bacterial population in check. It is important to note that aquatic plants and organisms, such as fish, have specific physiological adaptations to handle oxygen and salt variations in their environment. However, in the context of gardens, these specialized adaptations may not have a significant impact on the anaerobic bacterial population in the soil. In conclusion, based on the given information, it can be inferred that Ned's garden, which is flooded, is likely to have a higher concentration of anaerobic bacteria in its soil compared to Bobby's garden. This is primarily due to the reduced oxygen availability and altered soil chemistry caused by the flooding condition in Ned's garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"3000\\" correctly answer the question \\"Approximately how many years passed between the Xia Dynasty and the creation of the oldest known bronze vessels in China?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"3000\\" correctly answers the question \\"Approximately how many years passed between the Xia Dynasty and the creation of the oldest known bronze vessels in China?\\".

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. Context: Van Halen's next lead singer was Gary Cherone, frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band Extreme, a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s. The result was the album Van Halen III. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (\\"How Many Say I,\\" with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, Van Halen III did produce the hit \\"Without You,\\" and another album track, \\"Fire in the Hole,\\" appeared on the Lethal Weapon 4 soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The III Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and New Zealand.  Shortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album. Working titles of songs included \\"Left for Dead,\\" \\"River Wide,\\" \\"Say Uncle,\\" \\"You Wear it Well,\\" \\"More Than Yesterday,\\" \\"I Don't Miss You ... Much,\\" \\"Love Divine,\\" and \\"From Here, Where Do We Go?\\". The project was left unfinished when Cherone left the band amicably in November 1999. Citing musical differences, it is likely III's poor sales and critical reception had a big impact. None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material at all until three new songs were included on the 2004 Best of Both Worlds compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the Van Halen III follow up would be used in his next project with Tribe of Judah.  Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance.

His 46 sendings off in a 17-year playing career earned him the record for the most red cards in football - as well as the nickname \\"the beast\\". Bedoya's 41st suspension, which came after elbowing then kicking an opponent in the head, earned the defender an 11-game ban.

Plasma is formed when gas atoms are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, causing the electrons to be stripped away from the nucleus. In this state, the gas-like substance consists of free electrons and positively charged ions. Since the outer layers of the sun experience extreme temperatures, they are mainly comprised of plasma.

Unroll the fly tape and place one of the sticky ends against the ceiling to secure it in place. Allow the rest of the fly tape to hang down from the ceiling. Be careful not to touch it. The reason this choice is better is that flies usually fly at a certain level above the ground and tend to land in higher areas. By placing the fly tape near the ceiling, you are more likely to catch flies as they fly around in those areas. Choice (1) is not as effective because laying the fly tape on the floor only targets flies that land or crawl on the ground, which is less common. Also, laying the tape on the floor increases the risk of catching unwanted things like dirt, dust, and potentially harming small pets or being accidentally stepped on by people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Skylar would always have all the latest video games ready. Skylar sounded like fun.  Given that the answer to a question is \\"buy lots of video games\\", what is the question? Answer:","output":"\\"What does Skylar do to always have all the latest video games ready and maintain a fun environment around?\\"  The answer to this question points towards the act of buying lots of video games by Skylar. Skylar's hobby or passion seemingly revolves around playing video games and being updated with the latest ones in the market. Becoming a part of a video game's initial buzz when it is freshly released is a unique thrill for many gaming enthusiasts. Playing a new video game also offers a fresh experience as one can dive into unexplored territories, venture into new storylines, experiment with different game playing mechanics, and much more. Skylar, as it seems, takes great pleasure in these aspects of gaming and therefore ensures to have all the latest video games ready at their disposal. To do so, Skylar would presumably research upcoming releases, pre-order potential hits, and track release dates closely to purchase the games as soon as they hit the market. Skylar might also have a wide taste in games, spanning across different genres, platforms–from console to PC games, and styles–from large Triple-A studio games to smaller independent releases. This broad spectrum of interest would imply a larger number of games that Skylar could be interested in, therefore leading to frequent purchases. Importantly, buying lots of video games doesn't necessarily define fun by itself but the usage of these games, such as playing by oneself, hosting game nights, sharing with friends, or even reviewing or streaming them online could be the components that truly make this activity fun for Skylar. Hence their reputation of continuously having new video games to offer and provide entertainment not only for themselves but possibly for a group, making Skylar synonymous with fun video game experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Where does the biology teacher meet the former MMA fighter?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School.  Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off.  Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.  He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.  When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter.  While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

Smartphones were the source of 65 % of its Internet traffic and 41 % of its e-commerce, according to a report by the analyst Mary Meeker, titled \\"Internet Trends 2015\\". India's Internet boom has started. Within three or four years, almost every adult in India will own a smartphone. They will be used to order goods, read news, monitor crop growth and so on. Indian adults will be very interested in these devices just as young Americans are. 87% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 who own smartphones say they never separate from these: \\"My smartphone never leaves my side.\\" Four out of five say that the first thing they do on waking is to reach for their smartphones. And three fifths believe that in the next five years everything will be done on mobile devices. In the business world, the rise of mobile platforms is dramatically transforming many industries all over the world. What Indian software developers have to do is to start thinking about solutions to old problems by using all the features of these new devices. They need to take advantage of the unique properties of smartphones and tablets. As Indian software developers and enterprises master the smartphone, they will be able to export their solutions to the rest of the world. This will make possible a new tech revolution that is greater than what created India's IT industry in the 1980s and 1990s. We can expect the rapid transformation of India when a billion people become connected and have equal access to information and services.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who was the leader of Prussia at the time?\\"  Context: \\"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"At the time of the Treaty of Hubertusburg, which was signed on February 15, 1763, the leader of Prussia was King Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great. Born on January 24, 1712, Frederick II ascended to the throne on May 31, 1740, following the death of his father, King Frederick William I. Frederick II ruled Prussia during a period of significant expansion and military successes, transforming the nation into a major European power. Frederick the Great was a strong advocate of enlightened absolutism and made immense contributions to Prussian culture, politics, and the military during his reign. Besides being a skilled military leader, he was an accomplished writer, musician, and philosopher. He supported the arts and sciences and invited numerous philosophers and intellectuals, including Voltaire, to his court in Potsdam. During the specific context of the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick found himself in a difficult position. This treaty marked the end of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a major conflict that involved most of the great European powers and their colonial empires. Prussia, allied with Great Britain, fought against a coalition including Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden. The war was fought not just for territorial gains but also to determine the balance of power in Europe. Following the treaty, the status quo of 1748 was restored. This meant that Frederick reclaimed his territorial conquests, such as Silesia and Glatz, which he had gained during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). However, this also meant relinquishing Saxony back to its own elector. The Treaty of Hubertusburg demonstrated Frederick's ability to effectively negotiate and maintain critical territorial gains, which were crucial for the future of Prussia. His unwavering determination and excellence in leadership allowed Prussia to rise to prominence in European politics. Under King Frederick II, Prussia established itself as a powerful and influential nation, laying the groundwork for its participation in the future unification of Germany in the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is super helpful if your boots aren't all leather and you've only got a few spots to hit. If you don't have a spray bottle, you can use a sponge or an old rag to dampen your boots. Don't be afraid to get them nice and soggy, because any dry parts simply won't shrink. Spray from about 5 inches (13 cm) away to avoid making a big mess. Holding your dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) in from the boots, slowly and evenly pass over each one until they're both bone dry. The key here is to be gentle — holding the dryer too close (or running it too hot) can absolutely wreck your boots. The parts you dry first will shrink the most, so start with the parts of the shoe that are loosest on your feet. If either boot is still too lose, spray and dry the boots again in the same way. Repeat until the boots fit properly. The conditioner will keep your leather from cracking or peeling following the heat from the blow dryer. Feel free to use lots of the conditioner to make your boots really shine.","output":"The article provides a guide on using a spray bottle to target specific areas of a boot for shrinking, recommends using a blow dryer at a safe distance to avoid damage, and suggests applying leather conditioner after the process to maintain the boots' quality and appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   Question: suppose sealer is not applied to the wood happens, how will it affect The wind and water pick up less sediment.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: No effect To understand the relationship between applying sealer to wood and the process of sediment erosion and formation, let's first clarify what the question is asking. The question seems to be suggesting that when sealer is not applied to wood, it could affect the amount of sediment that wind and water can pick up. To answer this question, we must differentiate between the effects of sealing wood and the geological processes of sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition that lead to sedimentary rock formation. Sealing wood is a process used to protect wood surfaces from damage caused by water, moisture, and other environmental factors. By applying sealer, the wood is prevented from absorbing water, and it becomes more resistant to rot or decay. However, this preservation method is related to human constructions or crafts and not directly connected to sediment erosion or sedimentary rock formation. Now, let's break down the sedimentation process: 1. Wind and water erode rocks, which is influenced by natural geological forces and weather patterns. 2. The wind and water pick up the eroded sediment, forming sediment particles that are transported by these natural elements. 3. As sediment particles are carried away, they eventually settle in a new location, where deposition occurs. 4. Over time, multiple layers of sediment accumulate, with the older layers becoming compacted due to the pressure from the newer sediment layers above it. 5. This prolonged compression results in the formation of sedimentary rocks. Given the nature of this sedimentation process, whether or not sealer is applied to wood has no direct effect on the amount of sediment that wind and water pick up. Wood sealer is designed to protect wood from environmental damage, but it is not a contributing factor to the natural geological process involved in sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition. Therefore, the presence or absence of sealed wood in the environment will have no measurable impact on the sediment picked up by wind and water. In conclusion, the correct answer is C: No effect. Whether or not sealer is applied to wood does not influence the amount of sediment picked up by wind and water and is unrelated to the natural processes that lead to the formation of sedimentary rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting.

The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

Chicago DEA agent John Hatcher returns from Colombia, where drug dealers killed his partner Chico. As a result of Chico's death and years of dead end work, John retires and heads to his family's home town of Lincoln Heights in suburban Chicago. He visits the local school to meet his old friend and former U.S. Army buddy Max who works there as a football coach and physical education teacher. As John and Max celebrate their reunion at a club, a gunfight breaks out between local drug dealers and a Jamaican gang at the venue. The gang, known as the Jamaican Posse, is led by a notorious psychotic drug kingpin named Screwface full of West African Vodun and sadism. John arrests one of Screwface's henchmen as the gunfight ends. News of Posse crimes occurring in Chicago and across the United States spread as the Posse expands its operations and recruits more members. The next day, Screwface and his henchmen do a drive-by shooting on the house where John, his sister Melissa, and Melissa's 12-year-old daughter Tracey live. Tracey is injured and hospitalized in critical condition. John encounters a gangster named Jimmy whom he is forced to kill. A Jamaican gangster named Nesta arrives and is subdued by John, who asks about Screwface. Nesta gives information but tells him to go after Screwface alone and jumps out the window to his death.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? As a rule of thumb, you should not take out so much in student loans that you will pay more than 10% of your monthly income post-graduation. Research the average salaries of the field that you would like to enter and divide by twelve to estimate your monthly earnings. Do not take out a loan that would require you to pay more than that per month.  Student loans are typically considered a “good” form of debt, because college should increase your earning power enough to pay back the loans. Just be careful that your career choices are compatible with the amount of debt you might incur. Be cautious when taking out loans to attend a for-profit university. Tuition at these institutions is very high and their graduates have had difficulty obtaining jobs. One major chain of for-profit universities is currently being sued for its practices.  Do not let student loans deter you from pursuing a degree in highly profitable fields like medicine. Tuition can be particularly high in fields that require postgraduate degrees, but the earnings are more than sufficient to cover student loans. When in doubt, closely and intensely study statistics for your profession of choice. If you are entering a postgraduate program, it should also be able to give you statistics on student placement. Ask for these to confirm that the program is competitive and that it will secure you a job commensurate with the average wages in the field. If you meet certain requirements for long enough, the remainder of your debt will be forgotten. Specific types of student loans, including Direct Loans, Federal Family Education Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans can be forgiven if you make 120 on-time payments while working for a public service organization. Such organizations include the federal, state, or local government and not-for-profits designated as tax-exempt by the IRS. Find an Employment Certification Form on the federal student aid website. Submit it annually to verify that you are meeting requirements for loan forgiveness. Employers are often willing to commit some money to paying off student loans in fields that require specialized skills, including tech, nursing, engineering or finance. You should raise the question when you and your employer are scheduled to discuss compensation. An example would be during hiring negotiations. If you are already working for a company, wait for your annual review. Expect to forego a higher wage and commit to work for the company for a set years of time in return for the student loan payment. This can be a mutually beneficial arrangement because it will save your employer money in wages over the long term, while shaving off interest on your loans. You can save money by claiming a tax deduction on interest paid for student loans. You cannot claim a deduction for the principal on your student loan. Call your lender to ask what portion of your payment was toward the interest on the loan and what was on the principal. You can only claim this deduction if your modified adjusted gross income as an individual was less than 75,000 or 150,000 as a couple. The deduction also only applies if the loan was taken out for educational expenses. Consult an accountant to verify that you qualify. This is an exception to the general rule that you should pay off high interest loans first. Private loans offered by banks are often “variable” loans, which means the rate of interest changes with the general circumstances of the economy. Right now, the interest you pay on these might be lower than what you pay on your federal loans. However, as the economy improves, these rates are likely to go up.  Save yourself the risk of rapidly growing credit bills by putting whatever extra money you allocate to student loan repayment toward paying off your private loans. Summary:","output":"This article advises not to take out excessive student loans, highlighting the importance of researching average salaries in the desired field, being cautious with for-profit universities, considering loan forgiveness programs, discussing loan repayments with employers, claiming tax deductions, and prioritizing private loan repayments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There's magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film. A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. The new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. This leads to a big fight, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects, photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot.

After all,you'd bought these things a hundred times.  But now,I really look on those days with a feeling of yearn . How innocent we were! How carefree were those trips to the supermarket. No worries. Today a trip to the supermarket is filled with social influence. Every time I buy pork chops I think about the years I'm shaving from my life. I keep a careful eye on the freshness date and examine the tamper-proof packaging. I am victim of that most dangerous social disease:shoppers' panic.  I didn't realize how serious my condition had become until the last time I needed laundry, soap. It seemed simple enough. Just run into the market,grab a box of the old reliable and pay for it. I hadn't planned on discovering Ecover,a new brand of laundry soap. It sat quietly on the shelf right next to my old reliable. \\"Healthy,gentle but effective. \\"My respect for it deepened with each new claim as I read the entire package. Then I looked at the price:5. 69 for 2 pound. 5. 69! I cast a quick glance at the old reliable,still on sale for1. 39.  Six bucks for laundry soap! These people must be crazy! Who's going to pay six bucks for laundry soap? It's not as though I can't afford it. See,it's concentrated--use less,get more. BUT SIX BUCKS! And the box is made from recycled materials ...This act went on for a solid half hour,after which I left the shelf without any soap at all.  Surely the meat department is most threatening place. Remember what protein was good for you? That's all over.  Every bite you take kills you. I won't even mention meat's moral influence. When all is said and done,we still must eat. I gather up my healthy-cooking oil and my...

Choices:  - buffalo - fight for life - leave home - hunt for food - eating  The rationale to choose \\"hunt for food\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"hunt for food.  Step 1: Analyze the question and choices given. - The question is asking about an animal with sharp teeth.  - The choices provided are: buffalo, fight for life, leave home, hunt for food, and eating. Step 2: Eliminate unrelated and incorrect choices. - The first choice, \\"buffalo,\\" is an animal and does not answer the question about what the animal does for dinner. - The second choice, \\"fight for life,\\" could be related to surviving but does not specifically answer what the animal does for dinner. - The third choice, \\"leave home,\\" does not have any direct connection with what the animal does for dinner. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer. - Among the remaining choices, \\"hunt for food\\" and \\"eating,\\" the most suitable answer is \\"hunt for food\\" because it directly addresses the question about what the animal with sharp teeth does for dinner. Step 4: Justify the chosen answer. The rationale to choose \\"hunt for food\\" as the answer is that it is the most relevant action for an animal with sharp teeth to perform during dinner time. Sharp teeth indicate that the animal is a predator, and predators typically hunt for their food. Additionally, \\"eating\\" is too general and does not provide any specific information about how the animal acquires its dinner. Therefore, \\"hunt for food\\" is the best choice in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

After adjustment for age, race, sex, site, education, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, all adiposity variables (body mass index (BMI), adipose tissue mass, percentage body fat, waist-to-thigh ratio, waist circumference, and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue) were significant predictors of the development of CHF. In a model that included waist circumference and BMI, waist circumference was associated with incident CHF (hazard ratio (HR)=1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.54 per SD increase, P=.02), but BMI was not (HR=1.08, 95% CI=0.86-1.35).

I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.

This process leads to some chemical changes in the food, ultimately resulting in the food becoming spoiled or moldy.  Step 1: Microorganisms land on the food's surface or are introduced to it through contamination (e.g., dirty hands, contaminated surfaces). Step 2: These microorganisms start to multiply by consuming the nutrients present in the food, breaking them down into simpler substances. Step 3: As a result of this consumption, microorganisms may produce waste products such as acids, alcohol, or gases which lead to the deterioration of the food's quality and safety. Step 4: Microorganisms may also produce enzymes that cause further breakdown of the food's components, potentially leading to unpleasant tastes, odors, and textures.

The phrase \\"Эстония на зимних Олимпийских играх 1992\\" translates to \\"Estonia at the 1992 Winter Olympics\\" in English. The 1992 Winter Olympics took place in Albertville, France, from February 8 to February 23. This event marked Estonia's first participation as an independent nation since its restoration of independence from the Soviet Union on August 20, 1991. Estonia's participation in the 1992 Winter Olympics holds historical significance as it demonstrated the nation's regained sovereignty and the ability to compete under its own flag. Estonia sent a team of 13 athletes to take part in various disciplines like Alpine Skiing, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing, Figure Skating, and Nordic Combined. However, despite their best efforts, Estonian athletes didn't manage to secure any medals at this particular edition of the Winter Olympics. An interesting note about Estonian history in the Olympics is that during the Soviet era, between 1952 and 1988, Estonian athletes were representing the USSR team in the Olympic Games. Some of them had remarkable successes and contributed to Soviet Union's medal tally. In conclusion, \\"Estonia at the 1992 Winter Olympics\\" signifies the reintroduction of Estonia as an independent nation on the Olympic stage. The event marked the beginning of a new chapter for Estonian athletes who, after regaining their independence, could represent their country with pride and compete under the Estonian flag.

Context: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" Question: When did Obama announce his donation for a summer jobs program?

Answer with \\"True\\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \\"False\\" Input: Review: I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \\"dust\\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

Add spaces: 2.Usefewerwordsthataremoregeneric.","output":"Here is the sentence with spaces added for better readability: 2. Use fewer words that are more generic. This statement suggests that when communicating or writing, it is better to opt for a concise approach by using fewer words to convey the same meaning. The idea is to select more general or all-encompassing terms instead of using an excessive number of specific or detailed words. Although every writing and communication style has its merit, using fewer words with more generic meanings can help make the message or information easier to understand. This is especially important when addressing a broader audience, as the diversity of the readers or listeners may lead to individual interpretations of the message. Using more generic words also helps in minimizing confusion and improving overall comprehension. It encourages the reader or listener to focus on the main point of the message, rather than getting lost in the intricate details and nuances of the words. Additionally, this method can save time and energy, both for the writer or speaker and the audience, since less time and effort are required in decoding complex information. To put this advice into practice, consider the following steps: 1. Analyze your message - Determine the main point and ensure that it is the focus of your communication. 2. Omit unnecessary words or phrases - Remove any words that don't contribute directly to the central idea or might even obstruct it. 3. Replace specific words with general terms - Consider using broader, more inclusive language that can effectively convey the message without relying on technical jargon or overly complex terminology. 4. Review and revise - After you have applied the suggestions above, read your message again to make sure that it is clear, concise, and understandable while still reflecting your intentions. Overall, using fewer words that are more generic can lead to more effective and efficient communication by simplifying the core message and making it more accessible to a wider audience. However, it is essential to strike the right balance between simplicity and clarity to avoid oversimplifying the information to the point where it loses its intended meaning or purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \\"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970.

News article: Should You Name Your Startup After a Meme? What do you do when you want to build up buzz for your startup without revealing an iota of what its purpose is? Name it after one of the most divisive memes on the Internet, of course: Hipster. So what is Hipster? We don’t know. The service is currently in stealth mode, the only info available being a “Coming Soon” page featuring a picture of your city and a call to sign up for more information. One is also asked to refer the service to three friends in order to gain swifter access. According to founder Doug Ludlow (who we wrote about four years ago for creating GroupMe predecessor Zemble), Hipster had been in a small closed alpha in Boulder, Colorado up until yesterday. (If you do a bit of digging on Hacker NewsHacker News you’ll see folks commenting on the alpha, which they liken to “Quora meets Foursquarefoursquare” — so there you go.) Ludlow wouldn’t tell us any more about the startup yet — he has applied to Jason Calacanis’s Launch Conference, and can’t say anything until he knows whether he’s made the cut. However, he has agreed to fill us in when he can, so stay tuned. Putting functionality aside for a moment, let’s focus on the name, which came to my attention after TechCrunch discoursed on the matter the other day. “Hipster” is an extremely controversial term in some respects (believe me, I’m supposed to be an expert on it, apparently) — as Ludlow says, “Some people hate the name, some people laugh when they hear it” — but it is also representative of a rather popular InternetInternet meme. Remember, we named “Hipsters” one of our favorite memes of 2010. And memes — of late — have spelled money for many companies. In recent months, we’ve seen several companies hitching their wagons to the meme/viral culture train — the Travelocity Gnome appeared on Chatroulette, as did that Last Exorcism chick, the Double Rainbow Guy shilled for Microsoft, and, most recently, golden-voiced homeless man Ted Williams was in a commercial for Kraft. “Hipsters,” for their part, have most notably shown up in a commercial for Honda. The adoption of the term by companies makes sense; “hipster,” as a word, has had a steadily growing presence on the web in the past year or so — take a look at Google Trends — and we’ve seen a proliferation of humor blogs, videos and parody songs bubbling across the web in the past 12 months as a result (still, the term seems to be plateauing of late, so Ludlow might want to speed up his reveal). For SEO’s sake alone, calling your service “Hipster” is a pretty shrewd move. Case in point, Ludlow says: “[Signups have] been insane over the last 15 hours. We’ve had close to 3,700 signups now. At the rate we’re going, we’re going to hit 10,000 by the end of the day.” While we can’t attribute the growing interest in the startup to the name alone, it’s safe to say it’s providing a goodly amount of the attention — given that no one knows what the startup is. So far, the divisive nature of the name seems to be doing well for Ludlow (aside from the few e-mails expressing broad disdain for hipster culture), but is the assignation of the term a wise choice in the long run when it comes to business? We asked a few experts for their input on this particular memefication: What’s in a name? Well, when you’re a business — everything. Yes, startups with admittedly silly names have more than succeeded (TwitterTwitter, anyone?), but naming your startup after a counterculture, or the meme that it has spawned, seems a little risky. To see how “Hipster” rates when it comes to staying power, MashableMashable turned to Nina Beckhardt, president of The Naming Group (an agency whose employees have crafted names for Walmart, Target and Puma). After being presented with the little information we have and the name itself, she told us that Ludlow is really going to have to amp up the humor of the term if he wants to succeed, playing off of the tongue-in-cheek quality of the word. “From what I can see in terms of their current pre-launch marketing tactics, this attention-grabbing, too cool for school (the categorical summation of most hipsters), just-you-wait-and-see type of witholding strategy, the name has real promise,” Beckhardt says. “That is a strategy that a hipster might choose.” Still, in order for the business to succeed, it has to offer more than the temporal popularity of the word, Beckhardt says. “The offering’s equity must hold strong and grow no matter how the definition morphs or how centrally or peripherally it remains in our lexicon over time. Again, it’s a bold move. The success of the name is ultimately dependent on execution and delivery of the offering.” As we mentioned before, the application of a meme to a marketing campaign is nothing new. Still, we began to wonder how successful these campaigns really were. David Berkowitz, senior director of emerging media and innovation at 360i, tells us that it’s a fine line when it comes to the marriage between marketing and memes. “A lot of marketers can get publicity, but it’s not always good publicity,” he says. “Then there’s the trick of capitalizing on it. Do people remember that Microsoft did the Double Rainbow spot, and then do they know what product Microsoft was promoting? (Answer: Windows Live, which I had to GoogleGoogle –- I didn’t even BingBing it.)” “For Hipster, I’m especially curious if the site is ultimately hip, ironic, snarky, Brooklyn-esque, or in any way remotely related to its name,” he adds. “Hipster will probably do well attracting signups, based on the buzz I’m seeing already. But without any context, who knows if any of these people signing up will actually care about the site once it launches.” So again, it all depends on how the product stacks up against the initial popularity of the meme. So how do the denizens of the counter culture feel about the whole thing? Will they embrace it in the same way many a hipster (and non-hipster) has embraced the similarly monikered Hipstamatic iPhone app? Well, it’s not like I can go downstairs to my local coffee shop and ask one of the “freelance graphic designers” looking at FacebookFacebook on their laptops (because no one would admit to being one), so instead I turned to Carles, founder of Hipster Runoff and the de facto father/mother(?) of the whole hipster blogging movement. (S/he also wrote a post on the service.) “There is no way that this web gimmick service can add any sort of value 2 any1′s life,” s/he tells us via e-mail. “After the success of the hit Mark Zuckerbro mockumentary ‘My Social Network–Plz friend me and Tag Me In Fotos,’ more people than ever are trying to start web startups that will not only make them rich, but also make them global icons. It seems as thought the era of ‘people starting buzzbands’ 2 be relevant, rich, & famous is over, and the era of ‘starting bloggable web startups’ has begun. I am positive that this CEO has visions of a ‘Groupon-like valuation,’ but it is more likely that this initial wave of blog coverage will be the only value that ‘Hipster.biz’ will be able to cultivate.” So that’s a “no,” then. Image courtesy of FlickrFlickr, Jack Newton What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The article discusses the implications of naming a start-up after an internet meme, using the example of Doug Ludlow’s business, Hipster, which is currently in stealth mode.  Naming a start-up after a meme is a calculated move due to the pop culture status of memes. It is a strategy to build interest and intrigue about the company without revealing any specifics about the business. The name \\"Hipster\\" was chosen due to the term’s existing significance as a controversial and commonly used term within internet culture.  Ludlow claims that the response to the name has been heavily divided, with some people laughing while others expressing vehement dislike. This divisive reaction, however, is thought to be contributing to the buzz surrounding the company. Ludlow reports the company has had a substantial wave of sign-ups.  The article also emphasizes the role of memes in modern marketing. In recent times, multiple businesses have leveraged internet memes, viral images, videos, or phrases that people interact with and share, in their marketing campaigns. However, experts suggest that it's a risky line to tread. The key to success when it comes to naming a business after a meme, according to Nina Beckhardt, president of The Naming Group, and David Berkowitz, senior director of emerging media and innovation at 360i, is dependent on the actual offerings of the company, not just the initial popularity brought by the meme. The narrative presents the skepticism from different perspectives, including a comment by Carles, founder of Hipster Runoff, on the value and future prospects of such a start-up. He is doubtful of the long-term viability and significance of such a start-up, viewing it as an ephemeral wave that is currently in trend due to the popularity of web start-ups.    The article raises a contemplative question on whether the association with a meme would be a wise business decision in the long run. However, with no clear answer, the growth and acceptance of the Hipster company remain to be seen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Living a quiet life in a small, remote town, he carefully guards his true identity, fueled by paranoia and a dangerous secret. Little does he know that his past is about to catch up with him. FBI Agent Anna Gallagher is assigned to a series of mysterious threats that are targeting high-profile political figures. The threats seem to be coming from a ghost, leaving no traces behind. As the threats escalate to assassination attempts, Anna's superiors grow desperate to apprehend the mysterious assailant. As Anna digs deeper into the case, she stumbles upon an encrypted document with ties to a secret government project named \\"The Veil\\", which was disbanded several years ago. The project was aimed at creating the perfect assassin, using advanced psychological conditioning and mind-control techniques. Anna learns that Straker was one of the top operatives in the program, now seemingly turned against those who created him. Anna's investigation leads her to the small town where Straker is hiding. The two cross paths, and a cat-and-mouse game of wits begins. Straker attempts to shake her off his trail in a deadly game of deception and manipulation. However, Anna proves to be a formidable adversary and manages to uncover more about Straker's motives and the secrets he holds. As Anna gets closer to the truth, she discovers that Straker is not acting alone but is part of a larger conspiracy to expose and bring down corruption within the highest levels of government. She begins to question her own loyalties and the organization she works for. Meanwhile, Straker deals with a crisis of conscience. Having lived in the small town for years, he has built genuine relationships with the locals. As the FBI closes in, he's forced to confront the possibility of endangering the people with whom he has grown close. In a climactic final confrontation, Anna ultimately decides to team up with Straker, working together to bring the hidden corruption to light. Straker accepts the reality that he must face the consequences of his past actions, while Anna faces the realization that the institutions she trusted are not what they seem. As the credits roll, viewers are left with the lingering question of whether redemption and truth can really be achieved in a world of secrecy, deception, and well-guarded power structures. The future is uncertain for both Straker and Anna, but their actions have opened the door to change and the possibility of a new era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But people who want to rise to the top should concentrate on looking healthy, according to a new study. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion (pictured right) is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent (bottom row). They came to their conclusion after conducting an experiment where participants chose from different faces (shown) to pick the leader of a fictional company. They discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a pay rise or for politicians seeking election. In an experiment by VU University Amsterdam, 148 candidates were asked to select a future leader of a fictional firm by choosing between two digitally manipulated photographs of the same man. One image was altered to make him look healthier and the other manipulated to make him look cleverer. The experiment revealed that seven times out of 10, the man with the healthy complexion was more appealing than the intelligent looking male. ‘Here we show that it always pays for aspiring leaders to look healthy, which explains why politicians and executives often put great effort, time, and money in their appearance,’ said Assistant Professor Brian Spisak from the Department of Management and Organisation at the university. The experts discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a raise (illustrated with a stock image) or for politicians looking to get elected. However, people are more likely to vote for a healthy-looking politician and choose a healthy-looking boss. Office plants help workers be more creative and productive, which could result in promotion, a University of Exeter study claims. At work, humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent, according to a study undertaken in December last year. The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent. Plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals, where patients with potted plants close by said they experienced less pain, anxiety and tiredness, while houses with plant-filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants. ‘If you want to be chosen for a leadership position, looking intelligent is an optional extra under context-specific situations whereas the appearance of health appears to be important in a more context-general way across a variety of situations.’ In the experiment, the participants were given a job description that specified the CEO’s main challenge each time they were asked to choose between the two images. Job descriptions involved driving aggressive competition, renegotiating a key partnership with another company, leading the company’s shift into a new market and overseeing the sustained exploitation of non-renewable energy. The participants chose more healthy-looking faces over less healthy-looking faces in 69 per cent of trials and this preference was equally strong irrespective of the future CEO’s main challenge, according to the study published in the access journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. More intelligent-looking faces were only preferred over less intelligent-looking faces for the two challenges that would require the most diplomacy and inventiveness: renegotiating the partnership and exploring the new market. The aim of the experiment was to explore people’s implicit preferences for traits of leaders, such as health, intelligence, and attractiveness. The researchers focused on facial traits because these provide a wealth of information about individuals. In women as well as men, caring and cooperative personalities are statistically more likely to have a more ‘feminine’ face, due to higher oestrogen levels, while aggressive risk-takers tend to have higher testosterone levels and a more ‘masculine’ face.

SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Suddenly, his reflection cuts its throat with a mirror shard, killing the \\"real\\" security guard. Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.

Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3]  Paragraph: Bob has just graduated from medical school. He went on to serve his community.

The most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the magnetic mariner's compass, which permitted accurate navigation on the open sea regardless of the weather. The magnetized compass needle – known in Chinese as the \\"south-pointing needle\\" – was first described by Shen Kuo in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays and first mentioned in active use by sailors in Zhu Yu's 1119 Pingzhou Table Talks. There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement \\"[made] them more reliable\\" for anchoring ships.","output":"Shen Kuo wrote about the first use of the magnetized compass needle in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a standard game of chess, how many queens does each player start with????","output":"In a standard game of chess, each player begins with one queen. The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, with 64 squares in total, and each player has a total of 16 pieces at the beginning of the game. These pieces include one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are set up in two rows, with the pawns in the second row and the more powerful pieces in the first row. The queen is considered the most powerful piece on the chessboard, with the ability to move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally for any number of unoccupied squares. In other words, the queen can move like a rook or a bishop, combining their abilities. This flexibility allows the queen to control vast areas of the board and threaten multiple pieces simultaneously. The starting position of the queen is determined by her color. For the white pieces, the queen begins on the d1 square (the fourth square from the left on the first row), while for the black pieces, the queen starts on the d8 square (the fourth square from the left on the eighth row). The queen is positioned next to the king, and an easy way to remember her starting position is by recalling the phrase, \\"queen on her color\\" - meaning the white queen is on a white square, and the black queen is on a black square. During the course of a game, it is possible for either player to have more than one queen. This can be achieved through a process called pawn promotion. If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board (the eighth rank for a white pawn or the first rank for a black pawn), the player has the option to promote the pawn to any other piece of their choosing (except for a king). Oftentimes, players choose to promote their pawn to a queen, as it is the most powerful piece. This can result in a scenario where a player has multiple queens on the board, further increasing their attacking capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The number of Scottish boats carrying cameras - which monitor the fish being caught - has halved since the scheme was introduced. New species were added to the ban at the start of January. They include North Sea cod and whiting, which can no longer be thrown back into the sea. Fishermen have traditionally discarded unwanted fish because they carry a lower financial value but, if landed, would count against their quotas. The environmental group says the fall in Remote Electronic Monitoring compromises stock management. Figures from the Scottish government show there are now just 15 boats carrying cameras. When the scheme was first introduced in 2014, there were 32. Until this year, skippers were allowed an additional quota for North Sea cod if they agreed to install the camera equipment, but that incentive has ended. The ban on discards is covered by Landing Obligations which are being phased in over a number of years. They identify which species have to be brought ashore once they are caught. Helen McLachlan, the fisheries governance programme manager at WWF Scotland, said: \\"WWF is supportive of the Landing Obligation because, if implemented, effectively it offers clear opportunities, the most obvious of which is healthier fish stocks and a more resilient, profitable industry as a result. \\"However, with North Sea cod and whiting coming under the discard ban at the start of 2017, we have significant concerns about the levels of monitoring and control of the ban. \\"For this policy to work we need to be confident we know what is happening at sea and how much fish is being removed. Yet, on average, it appears that less than one per cent of fishing trips are being monitored.\\" The fishing industry has been opposed to the \\"inflexible\\" way in which the discard ban has been implemented under the Common Fisheries Policy. They say the regulations are the problem rather than monitoring. Bertie Armstron, chief executive of the Scottish Fisherermen's Federation, said: \\"Everybody's on the same side with reducing discards as far as physically possible. It's just a question of getting the rules right, which is a work in progress. \\"Cameras, frankly, are a little sideshow and the presence or absence of them will not solve or fail to solve the problem.\\" Quota incentives for other species still exist under the scheme, even though the incentive for North Sea cod has ended. By 2019, the disposal of all fish at sea will be banned. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"No-one wants to see dead fish being thrown back into the sea - least of all our fishermen. \\"Our fleet has already made good progress to reduce the level of discarded fish in Scotland and we are working hard to ensure the ban is implemented in a pragmatic, proportionate and phased way. \\"If managed sensibly, the landing obligation will be good for Scotland and help the conservation of fish stocks that offer up dependable and sustainable catches for fishermen.\\"","output":"The number of fishing boats in Scotland that have cameras to monitor fish being caught has reduced by half since the introduction of the scheme in 2014, leading to concerns over proper management of fish stocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jean Marc Gaspard Itard A:","output":"Title: Whispering Wilderness Synopsis: Set in early 19th century France, Whispering Wilderness is an emotive historical drama centered around the lives of Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a passionate and innovative young physician with a background in education for the deaf, and Victor, a feral child found living in the wild. Act I: In 1800, a group of hunters chance upon Victor, a young boy believed to be 12 years old, roaming the dense Aveyron forests in the south of France. He is unable to speak and apparently displays savage, animalistic behaviors. The authorities capture the \\"wild child\\" and bring him to Paris, where he becomes the talk of the city. As debates over nature versus nurture heat up among scholars and the public alike, the government assigns Victor's guardianship to Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, an innovative young physician with expertise in education for the hearing-impaired. Act II: Itard takes Victor to his home and begins the monumental task of 'taming' and educating the feral boy. At first, progress is slow. The wild child's distaste for captivity is apparent, and he frequently breaks out to roam the streets of Paris, only to be retrieved by a determined Itard. Itard introduces different techniques and methods involving patience, persistence, and intricate visual aids. Gradually, the teacher and student develop a bond, and Victor starts to show progress. Under Itard's guidance, he learns to recognize tactile symbols associated with various objects, responds to his own name, begins showing empathy, and manages to acquire basic social skills. Act III: While Itard's work with Victor proves controversial among the high society, some start to question the efficacy of traditional education systems. The scientific community is torn, with some lauding Itard's rehabilitation efforts as revolutionary and others condemning his \\"tampering with nature.\\" Itard becomes increasingly obsessed with teaching Victor to speak, believing it is the key to his full integration into society and a manifestation of his ultimate intelligence. Act IV: Despite Victor's significant improvement in understanding and various skills, his ability to speak remains limited. Itard is disheartened, but the pair's profound connection endures. As they spend more time together, they come to understand the sanctity of wilderness and the beauty of humanity. Realizing that Victor will never speak fluently nor completely integrate into society, Itard accepts his student's unique strengths and limitations. In the end, Victor is taken under the care of Itard's housemaid, Madame Guérin, who holds a genuine affection for the boy. Itard reflects on their journey and the lessons he’s learned about the powerful synergies between nature, nurture, and the value of unconventional teaching methods. Whispering Wilderness ends with Itard, Victor, and Madame Guérin standing at the edge of the Aveyron forest, symbolically recognizing the indefinable bond between the human condition and the untamed world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer seems to have had high expectations for the book \\"The Profitable Retailer\\" based on the positive reviews they had read prior to their purchase. However, upon reading the book, they found it to be lacking in terms of providing insightful information. Instead, they felt that the content mainly covered what they consider to be \\"common sense retail concepts.\\" Their overall disappointment with the book's content is a clear indication of a negative stance towards the product.  Several factors contribute to the negative tone of this review: 1. Unmet Expectations: The reviewer's disappointment stems from the initial expectations they had for the book, perhaps led by previous positive reviews they encountered. When a product does not meet or surpass its expectations, it is usual for the consumer to express dissatisfaction, contributing to a negative tone in their review. 2. Lack of Insightful Information: The reviewer mentions that they were anticipating more insightful content from the book. In this context, the absence of valuable information not only leads to dissatisfaction but also conveys the reviewer's disappointment in the lack of novelty or uniqueness of the book's content, representing a negative perspective on the product. 3. Coverage of Common Sense Concepts: The reviewer suggests that the book's main content could be easily classified as common sense in the retail industry. This sentiment further emphasizes their disappointment, as they possibly expected the book to provide new information that might be unknown to them or require more profound analysis and understanding. 4. Overall Disappointment: The review ends with the statement that the reviewer was disappointed with the content. This conclusive remark sets a strongly negative tone for the review, as the reviewer is left underwhelmed by the product despite their initial interest based on other reviews.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. For every four inches (10cm) above five feet a person was, the researchers said they had a 16% increased cancer risk. The study of more than one million women, published in The Lancet Oncology, suggested chemicals that control growth might also affect tumours. Cancer Research UK said tall people should not be alarmed by the findings. The study followed 1.3 million middle-aged women in the UK between 1996 and 2001. It linked 10 cancers to height - colon, rectal, malignant melanoma, breast, endometrial (uterus), ovarian, kidney, lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia. Those in the tallest group, over 5ft 9in, were 37% more likely to have developed a tumour than those in the shortest group, under 5ft. Although the study looked only at women, the researchers said the height link was also present in men. They combined 10 other research studies which showed a similar link in men. Dr Jane Green, lead researcher and from the University of Oxford, told the BBC: \\"Obviously height itself cannot affect cancer, but it may be a marker for something else.\\" By James Gallagher, Health reporter. Overweight patients may have been told to lose a few inches for the good of their health in the past - this time there's nothing anyone can do about it. Height, however, is not a universally bad thing. It is believed people are becoming taller due to better nutrition and fewer diseases in childhood. Being tall has also been linked to reduced rates of heart disease. It is also not the biggest contributor to cancer. A height link was greatly reduced or eliminated for some cancers in smokers - researchers said the effect of height had been \\"swamped\\". Obesity is also a big factor, a 10 point increase in Body Mass Index increases the risk of breast cancer by around 40%. Height might one day help doctors screen for cancer risk and it is hoped, that by furthering the understanding of cancers, the study will help researchers discover treatments. Scientists believe that as there is a link across many cancers there \\"may be a basic common mechanism\\". They think, but have not proved, that growth hormones - such as insulin-like growth factors - may be the explanation. Higher levels of growth factors could do two things. They could result in more cells - taller people are made of more stuff so there are more cells which could mutate and become tumours. Alternatively, they could increase the rate of cell division and turnover, increasing the risk of cancer. But as Dr Green admitted: \\"The point is we don't know.\\" Cancer Research UK's Sara Hiom said: \\"Tall people need not be alarmed by these results. Most people are not a lot taller, or shorter, than average, and their height will only have a small effect on their individual cancer risk.\\" Dr Caitlin Palframan, policy manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: \\"The big question is why this connection exists. If we can unravel why height affects the risk of cancer it will lead us closer to understanding how some cancers develop.\\" The researchers suggested that height could also have contributed to increasing cancer incidence. In Europe, average height is thought to have increased by around 1cm every decade during the 20th Century. They argued that the height increase in that time could have resulted in a 10-15% more cancers than if heights had remained the same. This article was about:","output":"This article talks about a study that found a connection between being tall and having a higher chance of getting cancer.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer these questions, let's take a step-by-step approach to analyze and understand the motivations behind patriotism and the slight differences between the questions. 1. Define patriotism: Patriotism is a strong emotional attachment to one's country and its values. It often involves a sense of pride, loyalty, and deep love towards the nation. 2. Identify common reasons for patriotism: People may be patriotic due to a variety of factors such as cultural connections, shared historical experiences, social belonging, and personal upbringing. Patriotism can also be promoted by national symbols, anthems, and rituals that create a sense of unity among individuals. 3. Compare the questions: The first question is asking about the reasons behind some people's patriotism, while the second question is emphasizing the intensity of patriotism in people. Both questions are related, but they approach patriotism from different angles. 4. Are the questions the same? Not entirely. While both questions are asking about the reasons for patriotism, the first question is more focused on why some individuals exhibit patriotic feelings, while the second question is asking why people express strong levels of patriotism. The essence of both questions is similar, but they highlight different aspects of the same topic. In conclusion, while both questions relate to the concept of patriotism, they are not entirely the same as they emphasize different aspects of it. People may be patriotic for various reasons such as shared cultural bonds, historical experiences, social connections, and personal upbringing. The intensity of patriotism varies among individuals and is influenced by the factors that contribute to their attachment to their country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In 1767, the whole of Malabar again revolted Mysore's army of 4,000 men, who were defeated by 2,000 Kottayam Nairs in Northern Malabar. All baggage, arms and ammunition of army was looted by the Nair rebels. Mysorean garrisons were trapped by Nair rebels who seized the countryside and ambushed Mysore convoys and communications with great success. The following year, the English East India Company, under Captain Thomas Henry, sieged the Sultan Bathery Fort  to interrupt the supply of arms to Arakkal Kingdom, with a promised help from local kingdoms. But the British were forced to retreat in the retaliation. Mysore army retreated from Malabar temporarily in 1768, successfully crushing the uprisings and building the strategic Palakkad Fort. The authority over Kolathunad was now given to the Arakkal Kingdom. Skirmishes between Arakkal and the Company continued, and in 1770, the Company reclaimed Randattara. In 1773, Mysore forces under Said Saheb and Srinivasarao marched to Malabar through the Thamarassery Pass, since the Hindu rulers had broke the earlier treaties on paying tributes.

Ben Richards (Ayres) of the Air Force Space Command insists that Dan is their best pilot, even though when piloting the Y-12 into the ionosphere, he began experiencing flight difficulties. Upon landing, Dan broke flight regulations by going to see his girlfriend (Landi), rather than immediately filing his flight report. Despite these concerns, Capt. Richards insists that Dan pilot the Y-13 after a thorough check-out and briefing by Dr. Paul von Essen ([Jaffe). The Y-13 takes off, and at 600,000 feet, Dan is supposed to level off and begin his descent. But he continues to climb, firing his rocket emergency boost for more speed. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the Y-13 while passing through a dense cloud of unknown material, which forces him to eject. The New Mexico State Police later send a report that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute, attached to some sort of aircraft, land near his farm, 10 miles south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets with Cmdr. Prescott, showing him the wreckage. Tests later show that the automatic escape mechanism and braking chute operated perfectly.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Nothing I can think of. I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little. I tried to hide this but my husband blurted out “You aren't crying, are you” like it was the dumbest thing to do and for the entire movie going audience to hear. Sheesh! After the mom dropped off groceries, why did the daughter complain about having too much clothes? - She didn't enjoy going to the movies with her mom - not enough information - She didn't like her mom doing canon balls in the pool - She was embarrassed by her mom dropping by so often The answer is:","output":"She was embarrassed by her mom dropping by so often. The daughter complained about having too many clothes when her mom would try to surprise her with something new, which also made her feel like she was being treated like a kid. These frequent visits and actions, although well-intentioned, were seen as overbearing by the daughter and made her feel embarrassed."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

It was not until in my late thirties that I made this important discovery: giving-away makes life so much more exciting. You need not worry if you lack money. This is how I experimented with giving-away. If an idea for improving the window display of a neighborhood store flashes to me, I step in and make the suggestion to the storekeeper. One discovery I made about giving-away is that it is almost impossible to give away anything in this world without getting something back, though the return often comes in all unexpected form. One Sunday morning, the local post office delivered an important special delivery letter to my home, though it was addressed to me at my office. I wrote the postmaster a note of appreciation. More than a year later I needed a post-office box for a new business I was starting. I was told at the window that there were no boxes left, and that my name would have to go on a long waiting list. As I was about to leave, the postmaster appeared in the doorway. He had overheard our conversation. \\"Wasn't it you that wrote us that letter a year ago about delivering a special delivery to your home?\\" I said yes. \\"Well, you certainly are going to have a box in this post office if we have to make one for you.

Frequent fliers have some tips By Gary Stoller, USA TODAY To avoid congested roads and crowded airports, frequent traveler Rip Russell will fly home on Thanksgiving morning and fly back to his job in Russell, a production accountant working on a movie, says flying on those days to and from Atlanta shortens his holiday but reduces stress. \\"By traveling on the shoulders of these megapeak days, I'm far less likely to arrive stressed from the in-bound trip and the anticipation of the dreaded Sunday-after airport pressure cooker,\\" Russell says. About 24 million air travelers — nearly 4% more than last year — are expected to fly on U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, estimates the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers. Many travelers will be amateurs by the standards of Russell and other frequent fliers. They'll not have flown since this time last year or maybe two or three years ago, when planes and airports weren't as crowded as they'll be this month or next for the Christmas holiday. They lack the strategies that people who put in 50, 100 or more days on the road each year use to avoid hassles and stay cool, calm and collected while trying to get to their destinations. For those infrequent travelers, Russell and other frequent fliers from USA TODAY's panel of Road Warriors, who log millions of miles a year in the sky, offer some tips to ensure holidays aren't spoiled by the rigors of travel. Russell, for instance, suggests avoiding connecting flights on small regional jets in addition to avoiding peak travel days. Instead, he says, he drives the 2½ hours from Atlanta to his cabin in Waynesville, N.C. \\"I avoid the overpriced and cramped regional jet experience,\\" Russell says. \\"The cost savings is significant, and there are fewer headaches and opportunities for flight-related delays or lost luggage.\\" •Jeff Jones, a manager for a food industry manufacturer, says he books an early-morning flight, because airport traffic is lighter, and he has more flight options if his morning flight is canceled or delayed. He also checks in ahead of time online to avoid a wait at the airline counter. \\"I always allow more time for everything,\\" says Jones of Madison, Wis. \\"I double the amount of time I usually plan for getting through security.\\" •Christian Johnson, a vice president for a gaming company, says he books only non-stop flights. \\"Connections domestically are very difficult and unpredictable in the best of times,\\" says Johnson of Las Vegas. \\"During holidays, it's a crapshoot.\\" •Tony Goddard, COO of a company in West Seneca, N.Y., that manufactures equipment for the aviation industry, recommends that fliers without elite frequent-flier program privileges book higher-priced tickets. \\"If a flight is oversold or canceled, and you are fighting for a seat on the next available flight, a higher fare will put you much higher up on a standby list,\\" Goddard says. •Bob Bender, an architect in Lenexa, Kan., says holiday travelers should pack light but make sure necessary items such as prescription medicine and phone numbers are available if a flight is delayed. Bender and other frequent fliers advise travelers to not carry Christmas presents through security but instead ship them or put them in checked bags. Security screeners at passenger checkpoints \\"like boxes that are wrapped,\\" Bender says. Maybe the most important advice, some veteran travelers say, is to be at ease and have a positive mind-set when navigating through even the most crowded of airports, such as Atlanta's Hartsfield or Chicago's O'Hare, the nation's two busiest, respectively. \\"Relax and give yourself time to take in the displays that most large airports have available,\\" Bender says. \\"Atlanta has a great display of African art in the tunnel under the concourses. Chicago has the airplane flown by Lt. Cmdr. Edward O'Hare. And Denver has a great art display on the bridge between the main terminal and Concourse A.\\" Kevin Korterud, a consultant in New Albany, Ohio, says he enjoys flying just before Thanksgiving. \\"I feel a collective experience with so many people headed to destinations anticipating happy times,\\" he says. Korterud says he goes out of his way to help military personnel flying home. Several times, he has given them, \\"as a sign of appreciation,\\" his first-class seat or made them guests at an airline club, he says. Korterud, who travels on business four days a week, says it \\"may sound corny,\\" but he tries \\"to embrace the holidays\\" when traveling. \\"Put some old Christmas music on the iPod and look for large holiday lighting displays when flying at night,\\" he says. \\"Think about all of the people who are not able to travel before the holidays, especially those who are not with us.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis?  On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called & sounded for an hour. Read the... Answer:","output":"The name of the person who could not see Ninnis is Mertz."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Erin, on the other hand, was fluent in English even though it wasn't her native language. Over time, Erin had invested significant time and effort to learn English, attending classes, and practicing with native speakers in order to become proficient. The child, being a native English speaker, found it easier and more comfortable to converse with Erin as they were able to communicate effortlessly and understand each other perfectly. On the contrary, Tanya, despite her warm and friendly nature, faced linguistic challenges that made it difficult for her to communicate with the child. She had only started learning English a few months ago and hadn't yet achieved a level of fluency to engage in a meaningful conversation. The language barrier between Tanya and the child made it almost impossible for them to connect and share their thoughts, feelings, and ideas with each other. The child, being relatively young, hadn't yet developed the necessary patience and understanding to facilitate communication with someone who didn't speak their language proficiently. As kids often prefer engaging with others who can easily understand them and respond, the child felt more at ease while talking to Erin. This natural tendency played a significant role in their decision to engage more with Erin than with Tanya. It was quite apparent that Tanya wanted to engage with the child as well; she often tried to learn new words and phrases in order to be a part of their conversations. However, her limited vocabulary, coupled with her struggle to comprehend and construct sentences with appropriate grammar, prevented her from participating in deeper conversations. As a result, the child felt inclined to stick to communicating with Erin, who could easily grasp and participate in discussions without needing any additional assistance. This situation, however, also provided an invaluable learning opportunity for Tanya. Her interaction with the child motivated her to enroll in more advanced English courses and actively seek out conversation partners to improve her language skills. Over time, she became more fluent in English and eventually managed to bridge the communication gap that once existed between her and the child. In conclusion, the child talked to Erin but not to Tanya because Tanya didn't speak English very well, making communication difficult. This language barrier deterred the child from engaging with Tanya, while Erin's fluency in English contributed to a smoother and more natural interaction. While the situation might seem unfavorable at first, it eventually became a means for Tanya to further her language-learning journey and effectively enhance her communication skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: +0; +1; +2; +3; +4; +5;","output":"The two given sentences are: 1. \\"Someone pours olive oil into a bowl of tomato wedges.\\" 2. \\"The man poured oil on the tomato slices.\\" These two sentences are indeed quite similar in their overall meanings. However, they are not identical due to a few differences which can be noted.  First, the subject in the two statements is not the same. In the first sentence, the subject is vague and generalized as 'someone', which doesn't specify who is performing the action. On the other hand, the second sentence precisely identifies the subject as 'the man'.  Secondly, their tense is also different. The first sentence is in the present tense, depicting a current action, whereas the second sentence is in the past tense, referring to an action that has already occurred. The type of oil mentioned also varies. The first sentence explicitly mentions 'olive oil' while the second sentence is generic, simply referring to 'oil' without specifying what type which leaves it open-ended. The form of tomato is slightly different as well. 'Tomato wedges' in the first sentence suggest tomatoes cut into thick slices or quarters, while 'tomato slices' in the second sentence could refer to thinner pieces. Despite these differences, both sentences essentially refer to the same basic action, which is the act of pouring oil onto tomatoes. Given these factors, on the scale of 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as +3. This indicates that while there are notable differences, the two sentences do not digress significantly from each other in terms of underlying meaning. They share a common theme of the act of oil being poured on tomatoes, although the subject, tense, type of oil, and form of tomatoes are different. Thus, the rating of +3 accounts for the fundamental similarities while considering the evident disparities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this \\"A website that accused Google of abusing its position in the search market by \\"driving traffic\\" to Google Maps has lost its High Court action.\\" Article:","output":"Title: High Court Rejects Website's Allegation Against Google for Search Market Abuse The High Court has delivered judgment in favor of tech giant Google in a recent lawsuit, where it was accused of abusing its monopolistic dominance in the search market to allegedly steer traffic towards its in-house application, Google Maps. The website that levelled the allegations, whose identity is kept confidential for legal reasons, has seen its case dismissed. The website took the tech giant to court over claims that Google intentionally manipulated its search engine results to favor its own product, Google Maps, over competitor services. The plaintiff claimed this behavior led to a significant and artificial enhancement of Google's online map service's visibility and user-base at the expense of other market players. However, following an intense legal battle, these allegations did not hold up to the scrutiny of the court.  The major point of contention in this case was centred around the assertion that Google was misusing its overwhelming influence in the digital search marketplace. With more than 92% of global search engine market share, the company's position gives it significant sway over which products and services gain online visibility. The plaintiff asserted this influence was being unfairly wielded to drive increased traffic to Google Maps, thereby disadvantaging other online mapping services. Google, on the other hand, steadfastly refuted these claims. The tech leviathan defended its practices, pointing out that its algorithms are designed to offer users the best and most relevant search results. This includes prioritizing Google Maps, which is undeniably a popular and widely-used service, often perceived as more accurate and user-friendly than many of its direct competitors.  The defense further underlined that the algorithms consider multiple variables including relevance, usability, and user satisfaction. Thus, the purported higher traffic towards Google Maps, they argued, was an earned outcome of the service's superior attributes rather than a result of undue preferential treatment.  After a thorough examination of the evidence, the High Court was not swayed by the website’s argument. The court ruling acknowledged Google’s right to improve its own services and noted the lack of concrete evidence to prove the plaintiff's claims of Google biasing search results.  The High Court’s ruling is a resolute endorsement of Google's business practices and a rebuff to accusations of its alleged abuse of power in the search market. The dismissal of the lawsuit reaffirms that, while Google is undeniably a dominant player in the search engine market space, the quality and relevance of its services are significant contributing factors to its leading position.  However, this court decision is unlikely to quieten the ongoing debates about the potential exploitation of dominant market positions by big tech companies. Questions of market fairness, consumer choice, and the balancing act between fostering innovation and preventing domination will continue to shape future discussions and potential litigations.  While the High Court's ruling stands as a notable milestone in favor of Google, it does underline the necessity for clear and comprehensible regulations in this digital era, forming an intersection between user-centric service, fair business practice, and the immense influence of tech giants. These are issues that will continue to occupy legislators, regulators, and industry players in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Gordon Orr, OC (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. By the time Orr turned 16 in 1964, he was still two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was dissatisfied with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed to work with the family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug.  Eagleson was determined to get Orr a top salary. When Hap Emms, the general manager of the Bruins offered a US5,000 (US37,713 in 2017 dollars) signing bonus and US7,000 and US8,000 (US52,798 and US58,715 in 2017 dollars) for his first two years in the league, Eagleson countered with US100,000 (US754,256 in 2017 dollars) for the two years. or Orr would refuse to play with the Bruins and play for Canada's national team instead, like Carl Brewer. Orr wanted desperately to play in the NHL, but he went along with Eagleson's strategy and was willing to play for the nationals. The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US25,000 signing bonus (US188,564 in 2017 dollars), and a salary \\"less than 100,000\\" for the two years, a figure kept secret. Speculation has ranged on an annual salary of US25,000 to US40,000 (US188,564 to US339,415 in 2017 dollars) at a time when the typical maximum rookie salary was US8,000. (US60,341 in 2017 dollars) The official signing ceremony was done on Emms' boat, the Barbara Lynn, where Eagleson and Emms had conferred during negotiations.  At the time, it made Orr the highest-paid player in league history. But beyond that, the signing became one of the most important in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.  Orr joined the Bruins for the 1966-67 season, his first as a professional. The Bruins were not convinced Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation.  In that first season, Orr was challenged by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees for the first time in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17-43-10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.  For the season, Orr scored 13 goals and 28 assists, one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history to that point by a defenceman. Orr won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's outstanding rookie and was named to the NHL's Second All-Star team. New York Rangers defenceman Harry Howell won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenceman that year. In accepting the award, Howell said he was glad to win when he did, predicting \\"Orr will own this trophy from now on.\\" Orr was runner-up in voting.  In 1969-70, Orr almost doubled his scoring total from the previous season, to 120 points, six shy of the league record (which had been set by his teammate Phil Esposito the previous season), leading the league in scoring. As of 2016, Orr is the only defenceman in history to win the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer, which he also achieved a second time, in 1974-75. In addition to the Norris and the Art Ross, Orr captured the first of three consecutive Hart Trophies as regular-season MVP and later won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his playoff performance, becoming the only player in history to win four major NHL awards in one season.  Orr went on to lead the Bruins in a march through the 1970 playoffs scoring nine goals and 11 assists. The march culminated on May 10, 1970, when he scored one of the most famous goals in hockey history and one that gave Boston its first Stanley Cup since 1941. The goal came off a give-and-go pass with teammate Derek Sanderson at the 40-second mark of the first overtime period in the fourth game, helping to complete a sweep of the St. Louis Blues. According to Orr:  If it had gone by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really trying to get the puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.  The subsequent photograph by Ray Lussier of a horizontal Orr flying through the air, his arms raised in victory - he had been tripped by Blues' defenceman Noel Picard after scoring the goal - has become one of the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time--and today is highlighted in the opening sequence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Hockey Night in Canada telecasts. Did he get a large salary?","output":"Yes, Bobby Orr received a large salary. According to the article, \\"The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US25,000 signing bonus (US188,564 in 2017 dollars), and a salary 'less than 100,000' for the two years, a figure kept secret.

Q: I heard that Remy was ready to take the walk on the trail. Remy mounted their horses and galloped off.  And I was wondering What does Remy need to do before this? A:","output":"Before Remy is ready to take the walk on the trail and gallop off on their horse, they need to do the following steps: 1. Choose the right horse: Remy must first select a suitable horse that matches their riding ability, experience level, and that is physically capable of undertaking the trail. 2. Check equipment: Remy should inspect their tack (saddle, bridle, reins, etc.) to ensure that everything is in good condition and fits their horse properly. This will help prevent discomfort for both Remy and the horse during the ride. 3. Groom the horse: Grooming the horse is essential to maintaining its health and well-being. Remy should clean the horse's coat, mane, and tail, as well as check the hooves and pick out any dirt or debris. 4. Saddle and bridle: Once the horse is groomed, Remy needs to place the saddle pad and saddle on the horse, ensuring it's secured tightly. After that, they need to put the bridle and reins on the horse, making sure that every part is adjusted correctly. 5. Warm-up: Remy should spend some time warming up the horse before hitting the trail. This may include walking, trotting, and cantering in circles or other patterns to help loosen the horse's muscles and tendons. 6. Map out the trail: It's important for Remy to know the route they are taking so they can plan accordingly. They should study a map of the trail and take note of any particular challenges or hazards they might encounter. 7. Prepare safety gear: Remy should gather any safety gear they might need during the ride, such as a helmet, reflective clothing, and a cell phone. 8. Pack essentials: Depending on the length and remoteness of the trail, Remy might also need to pack some essentials like water, snacks, a small first aid kit, and any necessary tools for their horse or equipment. 9. Check weather conditions: Before setting out, Remy should check the weather forecast for the duration of the ride. Knowing the expected weather conditions can help them prepare for any challenges they might face. 10. Review the plan with others: If Remy is riding with others, they should all review the plan together and make sure everyone is on the same page. If riding alone, Remy could let someone know their intended route and estimated duration of the ride for safety reasons. Once all these steps are completed, Remy can confidently mount their horse and head out on the trail."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

They lost 1-0 at Carmarthen Town on Saturday while rivals Bala Town beat Cardiff Met 3-1 having on Friday. That meant TNS failed to win the title earlier than any other side since the league switched to 12 teams in 2010. The defeat by Carmarthen also means the Saints' 31-game unbeaten run in all competitions came to an end. After setting a new world record of 27 consecutive wins earlier in the season, TNS retained the Nathaniel MG League Cup with victory over Barry Town in January and manager Craig Harrison now wants the league secured as soon as possible. \\"You want to win every single game,\\" Harrison said before their defeat at Carmarthen. \\"Winning football games is enough to motivate me and I've got a likeminded group of staff, a likeminded chairman and likeminded players.\\" \\"I certainly don't get bored of winning and it's something I came into football for.\\" Saints' domination of Welsh football has seen them winning the domestic Welsh treble of the league, Welsh Cup and League Cup for each of the previous two seasons. Despite their unprecedented success and having won the league by a clear seven points in 2015-16, Harrison was not afraid to make changes to his playing squad last summer. \\"A lot of people said it was going to be the hardest season we were going to have,\\" Harrison told BBC Radio Wales Sport. \\"People said we weren't going to win the league at a canter this year and maybe not even at all. \\"A lot of clubs invested heavily and bought some very good players - Connah's Quay, Bangor City and Bala strengthened. \\"It was important that we went out and that we recruited players of a very high standard. \\"We had a bit of a turnaround with the squad with three or four going out and three or four coming in and it's been fantastic. \\"The players have been fantastic from the first game of the domestic season.\\" Saints had come into the current Welsh Premier League season after losing to Apoel Nicosia of Cyprus in the Champions League. They have not progressed beyond the competition's second qualifying round during Harrison's time in charge and the manager wants emulate domestic wins in Europe. The 39-year-old is inspired by the achievements of League of Ireland sides Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, who have reached the Europa League group stages during the past six seasons. \\"We're certainly not going to take our eye off the Welsh Premier League because you've got to win that to get into the Champions League,\\" Harrison said. \\"You don't want to take your eye off the here and now and winning domestic titles because that's your bread and butter and it get you into the Champions League. \\"But we all know that we need to start trying to get to the third and fourth qualifying round or even the Europa League group stages. \\"You look at Dundalk, who are a huge inspiration for a club like ours and are probably not much bigger. \\"It's probably the same budget and they got to the group stages of the Europa League. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"Shamrock Rovers did the same thing five or six years ago so it's something that certainly is our next step.\\" Saints have already gained international recognition for their achievements this season. In December the Oswestry-based club broke a 44-year-old world record held by Dutch giants Ajax for the longest winning streak in top-flight football. \\"Breaking the world record put us on a global scale,\\" Harrison added. \\"We weren't taking it as seriously as what people were making it out to be. You can't compare TNS to Johan Cruyff's Ajax team and all those top drawer players. \\"But in our own way we're very proud of that of record. To win 27 games in a row in any standard is a huge achievement and a huge feat.\\" Harrison's successful five years at Park Hall - in which he has guided the club to 12 domestic trophies - has seen his name linked with clubs in the English pyramid. The former Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace player admits there has been interest from elsewhere, but for now he is fully focused on achieving further glory with Saints. \\"At this moment in time I'm very happy but I am an ambitious manager. I want to manage as high up as I can,\\" Harrison added. \\"We've won one trophy (Nathaniel MG Cup) and we're in a great position to win the Welsh Cup with a quarter final against Bangor City. \\"And in a week's time we're in the semi-finals of the Irn-Bru Cup against St Mirren. \\"The Irn-Bru Cup has been fantastic for TNS because it's almost been like a European experience every other month. \\"We've had something to prepare for, in and out of the Welsh Premier League.\\"","output":"TNS failed to clinch the Welsh Premier League title early after losing 1-0 to Carmarthen Town, ending their 31-game unbeaten run in all competitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
