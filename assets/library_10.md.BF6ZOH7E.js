To determine if he was born within the past 150 months, we must first convert 150 months into years.  150 months ÷ 12 months/year = 12.5 years Now, we need to calculate the time elapsed since Paul Hausser's birth in years: 2022 (current year) - 1880 (Hausser's birth year) = 142 years As we can see, 142 years have passed since Paul Hausser's birth, which is considerably more than the 12.5 years specified in the hypothesis.

Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949.

Help as much as you can. Q:At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

Officers say the operation was not connected to an arrest near Parliament on Thursday, when a man was detained on suspicion of terror offences. The house in Harlesden Road, Willesden, which was raided on Thursday evening, had been under observation by police. Those arrested included a 16-year-old boy, a man and woman, both aged 20 and another man and woman both aged 28. A 43-year-old woman was also arrested in Kent.  All of them were detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts. The woman who was shot is under police guard in hospital but has not been arrested \\"due to her condition\\", Alex Paton, 50, who lives in Harlesden Road, said he saw a woman \\"getting all cuffed up and put in a white suit\\". He described seeing \\"coppers and masked men with guns\\". Another resident said she had heard the \\"bang, bang, bang\\" of shots. A neighbour of the raided property suggested the shot woman had suffered injuries to her left arm and stomach. He said the family who lived there were from Somalia. Ruth Haile, who lives in the road, said she heard shots and the woman on the ground shouting: \\"Don't touch me, my body, don't touch my dress.\\" It is believed to be the first time a woman has been shot by police in 10 years. The last time was in 2007 when Ann Sanderson was fatally shot in Kent. Police said searches had taken place at \\"linked addresses\\", as well as where the arrests took place.

That means they feared there was some kind of threat that needed to be contained - a threat that required a large team of the most highly-trained available officers.

The 21-year-old woman who was shot is not one of those under arrest - but has been described by police as one of the \\"subjects\\" - security services speak for someone at the heart of an operation.

The IPCC said it was gathering evidence but that no officers were under investigation. On Thursday, police arrested a 27-year-old man at the junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square, in London, as part of an intelligence-led operation. He was identified on Friday as Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, a British national who is believed to have gone to school in Tottenham, north London, but was not born in the UK. The Met said he had been detained on suspicion of terrorism offences and that knives were recovered from the scene. He had been on the force's radar for some time and it is thought police acted after a concerned family member contacted them. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she had spoken to the Met about both incidents and thanked them for their actions. \\"I would like to reinforce my gratitude to the police and security services, who work tirelessly around the clock to keep the people of this country safe,\\" she said. \\"They carry out their duties with calmness and professionalism, and we are all grateful for their dedication.\\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning A summary of the above article is?","output":"A 21-year-old woman was shot and six people were arrested in anti-terror raids in north-west London and Kent by the Metropolitan Police.

To set up an eBay account, click on the blue “register” hyperlink in the top left corner of the homepage. You’ll be asked to provide basic personal information, a method of payment for your seller’s fees, and a username. Think of your username as the company name of your online store. Make it a personal brand that is appealing and catchy without sounding too obscure or awkward. You’ll receive payments from any clothes you sell through PayPal. A verified account is easy to set up, allows to you sell internationally, and gives you more credibility on eBay. You’ll find a link to PayPal setup on your eBay account page. To begin, click on the “Sell” link on the top left-hand side of the eBay homepage. After choosing “Create a listing,” you’ll be asked to type in a description of the item. Follow the example provided, listing at least of few characteristics of the item, including gender, size, color, and style. A category will then be suggested for you, and if it seems accurate, click on “Create Listing.” For example, a search for “women’s gray LL Bean capri pants size 10\\" will recommend the category of \\"Pants.\\" Include basic elements such as brand name, style, color, and material. The more descriptive your title, the more often the item will show up in shoppers' search results. For example, an appropriate title for a pair of jeans is something like, \\"Ralph Lauren Polo Jeans Black Classic Boot Cut Size 8.\\" Be as descriptive as possible, including the brand name, material, size, color, and any pattern or embellishments. Use adjectives such as “dark” and “light” for colors, since the photo won’t appear the same on all screens. For women’s dresses give waist size and dress length, and for men’s shirts give armpit-to-armpit length, plus sleeve length.  For example, a good description of a vintage blouse would be, \\"Vintage 70's Pat Argenti sheer ruffle front blouse. Small black buttons in back, faux button front. No size tag so please check measurements for fitting. Measures unstretched  approximately:  40\\" (102cm) bust, 40\\" waist, 23\\" (58cm) shoulder to hemline. Dark green velvet ribbon detailing. Please note ribbon coming apart near the neck, also separating near the underarm & bust seams.\\" Give all measurements in both inches and centimeters for the convenience of international shoppers. Other helpful measurements include bust/chest, waist, hips, inseam, pant length, and bell width (for skirts or dresses). You have the option of selling the item at a price that you set, or putting it up for bid along with the option of a fixed-price sale (“Buy it Now”). If you’re concerned about your auction item selling at a really low price, you can set a reserve price under which it can’t be sold. Otherwise, for less valuable items, setting a low starting bid at 1 or lower can attract a high volume of bargain hunters. The greater the number of bidders, the better the chance for bidding competition that elevates selling prices. On the \\"Create Your Listing\\" page, in the section titled \\"Bring your item to life with pictures, click on \\"Add Pictures.\\" You can add one photo for free, but additional shots will cost a little extra. It's worth paying this extra price, especially for the more valuable items, to add several pictures for the the customers' convenience. You can make three shipping price options available to potential customers: free shipping, flat fee shipping, and calculated cost shipping. Offer at least one other method besides free shipping in case the customer needs expedited shipping.  For flat fee shipping, you set the shipping price when listing the item, based its packed weight. Use eBay’s shipping cost calculator to help estimate a cost for your item.  With calculated cost shipping, the shipping cost will be calculated for your customers at check out, based on your zip code, the customer’s zip code, and the weight of the packed item. You’ll be given the option to choose mail carriers and shipping speeds to offer to potential buyers. Make as many shipping methods available as you’re willing to accommodate, but try at least to offer several expedited shipping options, since some customers might decide not to buy your item if they can’t get it promptly. Strongly consider offering free shipping: it’s an incentive to buyers, you’ll get an automatic 5-star seller rating for shipping, and you’ll show up higher on the list of shoppers’ searches for your items.

The premise and the hypothesis contradict each other, as the premise states there is a home theater room being showcased, while the hypothesis states that there are no home theater rooms being showcased. In order to better understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's briefly define them: 1. Premise: A statement or proposition that serves as a basis for an argument or inference. In this case, the premise is that there is a huge electronics and computer selection featuring a home theater room and a classical listening room. 2. Hypothesis: A tentative assumption or supposition put forward to explain a phenomenon or form a basis for further investigation. In this case, the hypothesis is that there are no home theater rooms being showcased here at all. When analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, it is important to determine whether the hypothesis is logically consistent with the premise. In this case, the premise clearly states that there is a home theater room being showcased, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that states there are no home theater rooms being showcased. As a result, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, as they are contradictory statements. Instead, if the premise is true, it would indicate that the hypothesis is false because it contradicts the information presented in the premise. Conversely, if the hypothesis is true, then the premise would be false, indicating that there is no home theater room being showcased. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis would require further investigation, but it is not possible to conclude that they are both true based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Dracula Movie plot: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride.

So, she quickly ducked down to avoid getting hit by the smelly poo. However, poor Tanya did not know what was going on, and she couldn't react fast enough. The flying poo landed on her, covering her from head to toe in smelly brown goo. She was shocked and upset by the smelly surprise.

Determine the sentiment: This movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys, chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society, specifically when that technology is used for warfare. This movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology, but as the circle completes itself, familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology. Brilliant for it's time, the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some, but as a landmark in the history, development, and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. In the end, free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed, the state of society itself, as shaped by world events. Those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so, but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film posits. As far as qualifying as sci-fi, one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature. It asks us the questions, what if these events happened this way, and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? How would we react?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ted Thornhill. Smog and air pollution are lingering environmental problems in China. But a city in the northwestern region is determined to fight against dirty air using nothing more complicated than plain old tap water. Recently, local residents in Lanzhou, capital of northwest Chinas Gansu province, found that two giant sprayers had been set up at the Dongfanghong Square where a subway station of the city's Metro Line 1 is under construction. Will they see clearly now? The water sprayers will throw pulverized water 2,000 feet into the air to dispel pollution. Grand cannon: The sprayers have been placed next to construction works for a new subway station. Size matters: The cannons are enormous and have been getting a lot of attention from passers-by. The two long-range sprayers are able to pulverize and spurt out tap water to wipe out dust and smog within a radius of 600 meters to reduce air pollution caused by the metro construction. Martyn Chipperfield, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Leeds, said the water will cling on to the pollutants and bring them back down to earth. He told MailOnline: 'Lanzhou has a big problem with smog, like lots of Chinese cities. This is a small-scale effort to damp down the dust. The water will go up as a fine mist, and stick to the dust and form larger particles - and fall back down to the surface under gravity. It's basically replicating rain on a local level.' This does of course mean that anyone in the vicinity is likely to get quite mucky. However, Professor Chipperfield said that 'it will stop dust spreading over a wider area'. It won't stop pollution elsewhere, though, he added. Earlier this year Chinese scientists said that pollution 900 miles away in Beijing was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter. It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. Issue: Pollution is a major problem in many Chinese cities. Calamity: Earlier this year the pollution in Beijing was said by one expert to be having a similar effect to that of a nuclear winter. This process was under way in China’s capital city and six northern provinces, according to He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering.She warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian. Pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing in February had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, which is 25. Authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased. It remains to be seen whether the water sprayers can form part of a long-term solution. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a city in China that is trying to fight air pollution using giant sprayers that shoot tap water into the air. The city is called Lanzhou, and they have set up these big water sprayers near a construction site to help clean the air.

In the first sentence, it's talking about the actual route that a meteor, a caravan, or a storm is taking. Imagine it like the road they are following. In the second sentence, it's talking about the way a genius thinks or does things that is different from others. In this case, \\"path\\" is more like the choices a genius makes.

Options:  A. carrying things  B. coffee cup  C. iron  D. frying pan  E. briefcase Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the items most likely to have a hot handle are the coffee cup, iron, and frying pan. Each of these items typically involves exposure to high temperatures, which can make their handles hot to touch. Option B: Coffee Cup - Coffee cups often contain hot beverages, such as coffee or tea. These cups are designed to hold high-temperature liquids, and some heat can transfer from the contents to the handle, making it warm or hot to touch. However, many coffee cups have ergonomic handles specifically designed to stay relatively cool even when the cup is filled with boiling water. This option, while plausible, might not be the most accurate in comparison to the other choices. Option C: Iron - Irons are appliances explicitly designed to heat up for the purpose of pressing and smoothing out clothes. The heat produced by the iron usually comes from its flat, metal base, and it is not uncommon for the heat to transfer to its handle, especially after extended use. As a result, the handle of a hot iron can become hot, sometimes even requiring the use of a glove or cloth for protection when handling. Option D: Frying Pan - A frying pan is also used to cook food at high temperatures, which means that its handle is prone to becoming hot. The materials used in manufacturing frying pans and the thickness of the handle can determine just how hot the handle gets when in use. Some frying pans have handles made from heat-resistant materials or have silicone coverings to help minimize heat transfer. Nevertheless, the handle on a frying pan can still get very hot, especially when cooking for an extended period or on high heat. In conclusion, the most accurate answer based on common sense would be option D, the frying pan. While the other options mentioned can have hot handles, the frying pan is more consistently exposed to high temperatures and direct heat, making it the item most likely to have a hot handle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Engineers George Melton and Allan Chadwick work furiously to complete a design on time, even though it is Christmas Eve. Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet. However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston and teacher Jean Lawrence. They stay for dinner and soon become good friends with the three men and Madame Tanya. James and Jean also fall in love with each other, delighting the three men. When the engineers have to travel to another city on business, Madame Tanya begs Michael to take the train rather than fly. He assures her it is perfectly safe, but Madame Tanya's premonition proves tragically correct when their aircraft crashes in a storm, killing all three.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which planet has a higher internal heating?\\" is in \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Which planet has a higher internal heating?\\" is Neptune. This is because, as mentioned in the passage, Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, while Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. The higher internal heating of Neptune contributes to its more varied weather when compared to Uranus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Key points in the review that indicate a negative experience are: 1. Length of the visit - The reviewer states that they spent three and a half hours at the facility, which is a substantial amount of time that may have contributed to their frustration. 2. Cost of the service - The reviewer mentions that they paid nearly 500 for the visit, which is a significant amount of money, especially considering the outcome of the visit. 3. Pet's worsened condition - The most crucial point in the review is that the reviewer's puppy was returned in a worse state than when it was brought in. It is evident that the reviewer expected their pet to be cared for and treated appropriately, but instead, the puppy sustained an additional injury while at the facility. 4. Lack of resolution - The reviewer emphasizes that they left the facility without any better understanding or treatment for the initial issues (seizure and vomiting) that prompted the visit. This indicates a lack of effective communication and proper care for the pet. 5. Tone - Throughout the review, the tone remains negative and critical. The reviewer uses phrases such as \\"Thanks for nothing,\\" which emphasizes their dissatisfaction and anger with the service provided. Overall, the review paints a picture of a negative experience at the facility, and the reviewer does not recommend it based on the lack of resolution for the initial health issues and the additional injury the pet sustained while in their care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces o2 and H2O.\\"?

Answer this question: who invented slide rule and in what year??","output":"The slide rule, an analog calculating instrument, was invented by British mathematician William Oughtred in 1622. However, its development can be credited to several key historical figures and their contributions. The device could trace its roots back to the invention of logarithms by Scottish mathematician John Napier in 1614. Napier's invention of logarithms allowed for complex multiplication and division problems to be transformed into more manageable addition and subtraction tasks. It was a substantial breakthrough, as it simplified calculations considerably for scientists and mathematicians of the time. In 1617, an English mathematician named Edmund Gunter further refined Napier's logarithms, creating logarithmic scales that were inscribed on rulers. Gunter's rulers were the precursor to the modern slide rule design and were valuable tools for scientific and engineering work. William Oughtred then capitalized on the ideas of Napier and Gunter and invented the first circular slide rule in 1622. Oughtred's circular slide rule enabled more accurate and precise calculations than Gunter's linear logarithmic scales. The device used two concentric circles with logarithmic scales, and a user could rotate one circle around the other to perform calculations. Later, in 1632, Oughtred improved his design and developed the more familiar linear slide rule, which featured two logarithmic scales held together by a sliding component. This innovation paved the way for modern slide rule designs, and its usage for calculations became widespread among scientists, engineers, and navigators through the centuries. The slide rule remained a popular calculation tool until the 1970s when electronic calculators rendered them obsolete. While few people use slide rules today, their impact on advancements in science, engineering, and navigation was undeniably significant. The invention of the slide rule by William Oughtred in 1622 was a pivotal moment that revolutionized the way calculations were made, laying the groundwork for future innovations in these fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had heard so much about its exceptional service, beautiful landscapes, and welcoming atmosphere, but my recent experience was far from what I had ever expected.  Upon arrival at the resort, we were greeted with disorganized chaos which, to my dismay, set the tone for our entire stay. The check-in process seemed to take an eternity, with the front desk staff appearing unfazed by the long lines and visibly irritated customers. The employees were unprofessional and unapologetic, making me feel as though I was imposing upon them rather than being warmly welcomed as a paying guest. Our room, while spacious, was surprisingly unkempt. The bed linens were visibly wrinkled with suspicious stains, causing us to question whether they had been cleaned after the previous guests' stay. The bathroom had a musky, damp odor, and there was mold growing in the grout between the tiles. The air conditioning unit, despite our multiple attempts to repair it, seemed incapable of cooling the room sufficiently, causing sleepless, uncomfortable nights. The dining options at The Azure Resort were lackluster, to say the least. The on-site restaurant had a limited menu which failed to cater to various dietary preferences. As vegetarians, we found it difficult to find filling and appetizing options beyond basic salads and a small variety of unremarkable side dishes. The breakfast buffet, a crucial aspect of any resort, was underwhelming and looked as though it had been sitting out for far too long. The lack of freshness was abundantly clear, both in taste and presentation. Unfortunately, the resort's overall atmosphere did not compensate for its many shortcomings. The pool area was consistently crowded, with insufficient loungers for the number of guests. Consequently, we were forced to spend our relaxation time at the less-than-pristine beach, which was strewn with litter and sharp debris - quite a disappointing sight given the promising online photos of the resort landscape. Activities offered by The Azure Resort were few and far between, with the majority seeming unexciting and poorly organized. We attempted to participate in a yoga class, only to find that the room had not been prepared, and the instructor arrived late and frustrated. The resort's lack of attention to detail and guest experience made it difficult to find enjoyment in their offerings. Overall, our stay at The Azure Resort was a deeply disappointing experience. For a place that is supposed to be renowned for its exceptional service and stunning surroundings, it seemed as though management had become complacent and no longer concerned about the satisfaction of their guests. The disorganization, unkempt facilities, uninspired dining options, and lackluster activities made it difficult to find any redeeming qualities in our stay. I fear that The Azure Resort's days of glowing reviews may be waning, and unless drastic improvements are made, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this location to fellow travelers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: A Shine of Rainbows Movie plot: Young orphan TomÃ¡s (John Bell) is harassed and ridiculed for his small size, timidity and stuttering by the other children in his orphanage. Just after freeing a pigeon from his classroom, he is called to the headmasters' office to be greeted by Maire (Connie Nielsen), who has adopted him, and takes him back to her island home, where TomÃ¡s is greeted somewhat coldly by her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), a fisherman, who had expected someone older and perhaps more confident, and TomÃ¡s is intimidated by Alec. TomÃ¡s makes friends with Nancy (Tara Alice Scully) and is greeted tepidly by Seamus (Jack Gleeson). They take him to their 'secret' cave, inhabited by bats. There, TomÃ¡s runs away, scared, after which his two friends chase after him and console him. TomÃ¡s is introduced to his new school and, unlike at his previous school, here he is generally accepted by the pupils. As Maire's influence on him begins to shine through, he starts to gain in confidence and become drawn to wildlife. Soon thereafter, Alec and TomÃ¡s get a little closer, and when Maire has to go to the mainland for some shopping, Alec and TomÃ¡s go fishing. Together they find a young seal, apparently abandoned, on the beach. Christened 'Smudge' by TomÃ¡s, he wants to care for it and feeds it regularly for the next many days. For TomÃ¡s' birthday, the couple give him a new fishing rod &amp; reel. Maire suggests that the two guys go fishing, Alec to teach TomÃ¡s how to use the tackle, and the plan is set.

Augusta Jane Evans, or Augusta Evans Wilson (May 8, 1835 - May 9, 1909), was an American author of Southern literature. She was the first woman to earn US100,000 through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young. She was born Augusta Jane Evans on May 8, 1835, in Columbus, Georgia, the eldest child of the family. The area of her birth was then known as Wynnton (now MidTown). Her mother was Sarah S. Howard and her father was Matthew R. Evans. She was a descendant on her mother's side from the Howards, one of the most cultured families of Georgia. As a young girl in 19th-century America, she received little in the way of a formal education. However, she became a voracious reader at an early age.  Her father suffered bankruptcy and lost the family's Sherwood Hall property in the 1840s. He moved his family of ten from Georgia for Alabama, and scarcely ten when they moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1845. When the Mexican-American War had ended, and everything was in a disorganized condition, consequently there were no schools of any prominence. Had her mother not been cultivated and literary, Evans could never have obtained the education which fitted her for the work she later accomplished. During the Mexican war, San Antonio was the rendezvous for the United States troops sent to assist General Zachary Taylor, and the brilliant uniforms of the soldiery, the martial music, and the exciting events that accompany war, combined with the picturesque, enchanting scenery around San Antonio, furnished an excellent theme for Evans' first novel. In 1850, at the age of fifteen, she wrote Inez: A Tale of the Alamo, a sentimental, moralistic, anti-Catholic love story. It told the story of one orphan's spiritual journey from religious skepticism to devout faith. She presented the manuscript to her father as a Christmas gift in 1854. It was published anonymously in 1855.  However, life in a frontier border town like San Antonio proved dangerous, especially with the Mexican-American War. By 1849, Evans' parents moved the family to Mobile, Alabama. She wrote her next novel, Beulah, at age 18; it was published in 1859. Beulah began the theme of female education in her novels. It sold well, selling over 22,000 copies during its first year of publication, a staggering accomplishment. It established her as Alabama's first professional author. Her family used the proceeds from her literary success to purchase Georgia Cottage on Springhill Avenue.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was she poor growing up?","output":"Yes, Augusta Jane Evans experienced financial struggles growing up.

The car was likely to freeze that winter but the house was not because the  Available options: (A). house had poor heating.; (B). car had poor heating.;","output":"(B). car had poor heating. Living on the outskirts of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, lifelong residents Walter and Clara were no strangers to the harsh winters the Northland was notorious for. Their home, a charming farmhouse built in the 1920s by Walter's great-grandfather, was one of the few remaining original homesteads. The structure, as antiquated as it might be, proved itself impenetrable to the frosty onslaught year after year owing to the meticulous maintenance efforts by the couple. On the other hand, their car, an old patrol blue 1970 Chevy Impala, purchased by Walter in his youth, was not as resistant to the harsh freeze. Despite its strong American build and powerful engine, its heating system had been faltering over the years. Walter had been putting off fixing the car's heating for quite a while now. It was one of those tasks that always seemed to drown in the bucket of imminent chores. As another winter approached, the couple prepared their home and surroundings for the snowfall and icy temperature that were the hallmarks of a Minnesota winter. The radiators were refilled, and the fireplace was cleaned for the countless fires it would hold, emitting an ember glow amidst the cold sleep of winter. Clara made sure the woodshed was full to last them until spring. Stacks of logs were cut, dried, and stored. Each room had thick curtains to trap the heat, preventing it from gushing out the windows. When it came to the car, however, the task proved more daunting. The heaters had been showing signs of poor performance during the last winter and completely failed once the spring thaw had arrived. Neither Walter, with his handyman skills, nor Clara, with her relentless internet research, had been able to determine the root cause of the heat failure. They both knew that without a functioning heater, the car would likely freeze solid in the biting Minnesota winter. They feared the freezing of the car for many reasons. Despite its lack of modern creature comforts, the Chevy held sentimental value for Walter. Furthermore, it was a crucial asset for the retired couple. Trips to fetch supplies, visits to the doctor, and the occasional outing to the local saloon, all hinged on the operative state of their sturdy old Impala. Lastly, and more importantly, the car acted as a lifeline in many ways, especially during the winter months, when snow storms could make their home seem remote and desolate. As days passed, Walter and Clara noted with despair the falling temperatures, each day colder than the last. They knew they were racing against time. They reached out to family, friends, even mechanics across the country through phone calls, but despite numerous attempts, the Mystery of the Malfunctioning Heater carried on unsolved. Just as hope was on the verge of fading, the answer came from an unexpected source. Their ten-year-old grandson, who had learned about car engines in his remote school lessons, suggested that the problem might lie with the heater core, a critical part of the car's heating system. His theory was that the heater core, being clogged or leaking, might not be effectively transferring the engine's heat to warm up the car's interior. And so, they found their task for the remaining fall days before the freeze: cleaning and, if needed, replacing the heater core. As their handyman skills and hardness of resolve proved yet again, they restored the car heater to its original functioning just as the season's first snowflakes began to fall. Thus, as winter enveloped their world in white, the sturdy brick house and the old patrol blue Chevy stood, pushing back the frost. The house, with its reliable heating system, and the car, now boasting a fully functional heater, were ready to take on the icy cold breath of the Minnesota winter. They were a testament to human endurance and resilience in the face of elemental adversity. Both home and car – silent, steadfast warriors of the winter stood undeterred, unwilling to yield or freeze."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Drexler won an Olympic gold medal in 1992 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\\"The Dream Team\\") and an NBA Championship in 1995 with the Houston Rockets. He is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee (being inducted 2004 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the \\"Dream Team\\") On February 14, 1995, with the Blazers out of serious contention for a championship, Portland honored Drexler's request to be traded to a contender and sent the Blazer great back home to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Otis Thorpe in mid-season, right before the trade deadline. Despite finishing the regular season with a record of 47-35, which placed the Rockets 6th out of 8 playoff teams in the Western Conference, Drexler and long-time friend Hakeem Olajuwon helped propel them to an improbable second consecutive championship in 1995, sweeping the Orlando Magic. In his third and final NBA Finals appearance, Drexler averaged 21.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game.  During the 1995 NBA Playoffs, Drexler was ejected during a game between the Rockets and the Phoenix Suns by referee Jake O'Donnell, which allegedly stemmed from a personal feud between the two at the time. This would turn out to be the last NBA game O'Donnell would referee, as he was not assigned any further games in the playoffs that year, and eventually retired a few months later. In 1996, on ESPN's NBA Today, O'Donnell commented, \\"I wouldn't give Clyde Drexler much leeway because of the way he reacted with me all the time. I thought at times he would give cheap shots to people, and I just would not allow it.\\"  On February 13, 2009, Drexler participated in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Celebrity Game.

Paragraph: General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some only offer take-out and delivery. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.   - Object manipulation is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose.  - Philip Astley (8 January 1742  27 January 1814) was an English equestrian, circus owner, and inventor, regarded as being the \\"father of the modern circus\\". The circus industry, as a presenter of an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of his invention of the circus ring in 1768.  - Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.  - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Dinner theater (sometimes called dinner and a show) is a form of entertainment that combines a restaurant meal with a staged play or musical. Sometimes the play is incidental entertainment, secondary to the meal, in the style of a sophisticated night club, or the play may be a major production with dinner less important, or in some cases, optional. Dinner theater requires the management of three distinct entities: a live theater, a restaurant, and usually, a bar.  - A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists, as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.  - A trapeze is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Introduces possible negatives for children to expect Product review: This is a lovely book until you get to the part that tells the child what negatives to expect and that the parent will always be there to help with negatives. It's enough with the targeted age group just to say, as the book does in the beginning, that you and God are there to guide and love him or her. But laying the ground to expect bad grades and mean teachers (just one example) is not productive. And saying that you will \\"always be on the child's side\\" sets the child up to believe that you don't think he or she will ever make a mistake or be wrong or deserve punishment or correction from you! Better just to say that you will be there to help. I was disappointed because this book has some very nice parts, but I would not read it to my grandchildren. Life is hard enough without setting them up to fail. Two thumbs down on this one. Good Night God is a much better book. Answer:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for various reasons. Firstly, the reviewer highlights an issue in the content of the book, stating that it introduces potentially negative scenarios for children to expect in their lives, which may not be developmentally appropriate or necessary for the target age group. The reviewer emphasizes that they believe it would be more suitable to focus only on the guidance and love aspects rather than introducing negative themes such as bad grades and mean teachers. This critique suggests that the book might not be an ideal choice for someone looking for an uplifting and positive story to read to children. Moreover, the reviewer expresses disappointment concerning the message of the book, stating that it could lead children to believe that they will never make mistakes or be wrong. This point indicates that the book might not be effective in promoting personal growth and self-awareness, which could be crucial for a young audience. Additionally, the reviewer shares their personal experience by stating that they would not read this book to their grandchildren, suggesting that it might not be appropriate for other families as well. This subjective perspective adds an extra layer of caution for potential buyers who may be considering this book for their own children or grandchildren. Lastly, the reviewer offers a comparison by mentioning an alternative book – \\"Good Night God\\" – as a much better option. By providing a concrete suggestion for another, more suitable book, the reviewer might further discourage potential buyers from purchasing the original product. In conclusion, this review would decrease the chances of someone buying the product due to its focus on potentially inappropriate content, criticism of the book's messages, personal experience of the reviewer, and suggestions for an alternative. The review brings the negative aspects of the book to light and warns potential purchasers about its potential pitfalls in raising and educating children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Tinariwen (Tamasheq: , with vowels , pronounced tinariwen \\"deserts\\", plural of tenere \\"desert\\") is a Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band was formed in 1979 in Tamanrasset, Algeria, but returned to Mali after a cease-fire in the 1990s. The group first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of The Radio Tisdas Sessions, and with performances at Festival au Desert in Mali and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Their popularity rose internationally with the release of the critically acclaimed Aman Iman in 2007. Context: Tinariwen was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who at age four witnessed the execution of his father (a Tuareg rebel) during a 1963 uprising in Mali. As a child he saw a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar. Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a tin can, a stick and bicycle brake wire. He started to play old Tuareg and modern Arabic pop tunes. Ag Alhabib first lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he received a guitar from a local Arab man. Later, he resided with other Tuareg exiles in Libya and Algeria.  In the late 1970s, Ag Alhabib joined with other musicians in the Tuareg rebel community, exploring the radical chaabi protest music of Moroccan groups like Nass El Ghiwane and Jil Jilala; Algerian pop rai; and western rock and pop artists like Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Boney M, and Bob Marley. Ag Alhabib formed a group with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden Ag Ablil and Liya Ag Ablil in Tamanrasset, Algeria to play at parties and weddings. Ag Alhabib acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as \\"The People of the Deserts\\" or \\"The Desert Boys.\\"  In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of the best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region.  In 1989, the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib's home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some members of Tinariwen participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the military and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1992 some of the members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to record a cassette at JBZ studios. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people. Question: Were there other members in the group or was it a solo act? Answer:","output":"Tinariwen was founded as a group, not a solo act. It was formed by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who later joined forces with other musicians such as Alhassane Ag Touhami, Inteyeden Ag Ablil, Liya Ag Ablil, Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. These musicians came together in a collective to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people. Throughout the years, Tinariwen has had a fluid lineup consisting of various members who contributed to their music and performances. So, Tinariwen was not a solo act but rather a collective group of Tuareg musicians working together with a shared goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A: Answer:","output":"The most efficient possible engine is called the Carnot Engine, named after its inventor, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, a French physicist and engineer. The Carnot engine is a theoretical, reversible heat engine that operates using the principles of the Carnot cycle and achieves the maximum efficiency determined by the temperature difference between its heat source and its heat sink based on the laws of thermodynamics. Carnot's theorem states that the efficiency of any heat engine is always less than or equal to the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between the same temperature limits. This means that the Carnot engine serves as an ideal standard against which the performance of real engines can be compared. The efficiency of the Carnot engine can be represented by the equation: Efficiency = 1 - (T_c / T_h) Where T_h is the temperature of the heat source (the hot reservoir) and T_c is the temperature of the heat sink (the cold reservoir), measured in Kelvin. This equation shows that the maximum efficiency depends only on the temperature difference between the input (heat source) and the output (heat sink) of the engine. However, it's important to note that the Carnot engine is an idealized and theoretical concept, and it is not possible to create a real engine that would reach this perfect efficiency. This is because actual engines are subject to various sources of dissipation and energy loss, such as mechanical friction, heat conduction, and other irreversible processes. Despite its theoretical nature, the Carnot engine plays a crucial role in the study and development of more efficient engines, as it represents the upper limit of efficiency that any heat engine can ever achieve. Engineers and researchers use the principles of the Carnot cycle and the concept of the Carnot engine to improve the performance and efficiency of real-world engines, such as internal combustion engines and steam turbines, ultimately working towards creating more sustainable and energy-efficient technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favored Robert B. Anderson, a Democrat, who rejected his offer; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party. In 1956, Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6% of the popular vote.

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music.  - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.  - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927  June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961.  - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928  April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971.  - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song.  - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.  - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917  June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.  - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally.  - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the \\"Poet Laureate of Jazz\\", while \\"Time\\" dubbed him the \\"James Joyce of Jive\\". Al Jarreau has called him \\"pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planetmaybe that's ever been\\".  - The Composer of Desafinado , Plays is the debut album by Antônio Carlos Jobim , released in 1963 .

Fact 2: For flowering plants, the answer is the Flower.  Given the two facts above, what do flowers respond to? Answer:","output":"Flowers respond to a variety of environmental cues and internal signals, including daily and seasonal cycles, as well as diseases. These factors play a crucial role in the growth, development, and reproductive success of flowering plants. Some of the key factors that flowers respond to are: 1. Photoperiodism: Flowers are sensitive to the length of day and night, which change with the seasons. This is known as photoperiodism, and it is a crucial factor in determining the timing of flowering. For example, some plants, known as long-day plants, flower when the day length is longer than a critical threshold, whereas others, known as short-day plants, flower when the day length is shorter than this threshold. 2. Temperature: Flowers respond to changes in temperature, which can also be influenced by the seasons. Temperature has a direct impact on the rate of plant growth and development. Some plants require a period of prolonged cold (vernalization) before they can flower, while others need warmer temperatures to initiate flowering. 3. Hormones: Flowers respond to internal hormonal signals, which play a crucial role in plant growth and development. One hormone called gibberellin stimulates flower initiation, while another hormone called abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits flowering. Additionally, a hormone called florigen has been proposed to serve as the long-range signal that triggers flowering in response to photoperiodic cues. 4. Disease: Flowers can also be affected by diseases, which can interfere with their normal growth and development. Pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, can attack floral tissues, leading to loss of reproductive potential. In response to disease, plants can activate defense mechanisms that limit the spread and impact of the pathogen. Overall, flowers respond to a complex combination of environmental and internal factors, including photoperiod, temperature, hormonal signals, and disease. This enables them to maximize their reproductive success and adapt to the ever-changing environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As a speculative piece of fantasy and warily somber mood piece, this erotically charged thriller recalls Philip K. Dick, but in its finely calibrated formalism and vivid atmospherics, it’s pure Glazer. The story of “Under the Skin” — which was adapted from a novel by Michel Faber — doesn’t amount to all that much. But, true to its title and thanks to Glazer’s superb control and a mesmerizing performance by Scarlett Johansson, this creepy-cool exercise possesses a sinuous, insinuating power to burrow into the viewer’s consciousness and make itself felt for days on end. Felicitously enough, Johansson is already in theaters as the Marvel action heroine Black Widow; her character in “Under the Skin” could be called the same thing, albeit of an intergalactic provenance. After a prologue involving mysterious spheres, orbs and a whispered soundtrack of Johansson apparently practicing English phonetics, the film cuts to a lonely road in Scotland, where a leather-clad motorcyclist retrieves a female body from an isolated ditch. What this has to do with Johansson will all be made clear in “Under the Skin,” which will spend most of its time in the Scottish countryside, filmed by Glazer to maximize its inherently supernatural beauty; when Johansson’s character — let’s call her the Girl Who Fell to Earth — encounters a succession of local men in her generic-looking white van, the local accents begin to sound like their own alien tongue. As the ultimate fembot-fatale, Johansson is deceptively good in a role that demands sparkly, seductive animation one moment and dispassionate blankness the next. Just what her character is doing, and how that will or will not change her, provides the bare bones of a narrative that, while thin, can still be exploited for maximum aesthetic and even intellectual impact. With long, quiet takes in which he simply observes Johansson wordlessly taking in the world around her, Glazer infuses the everyday modern world with a surpassing sense of strangeness and doom. Even more fascinating is an emotional journey on the part of a heroine whose indifference to such feelings as pain, fear and empathy can be callous (witness an excruciating scene on a windswept beach) but, in another context, allows her to be non-judgmental of even the most dramatic human flaws. That encounter will propel the otherwise one-note plot of “Under the Skin” in a surprising and much more thoughtful direction. Once “Under the Skin” reaches its surprisingly affecting conclusion, it feels less like a cinematic novel than a well-executed short story. Viewers are likely to emerge from the film thinking, “More, please,” in the best sense of that phrase. It has taken almost ten years for Glazer to get from “Birth” to “Under the Skin”; with luck, he’ll be back sooner with his next film.

By explicitly stating that they asked officials in each agency, it demonstrates their commitment to ensuring the accuracy and credibility of the information presented. This active approach reinforces the hypothesis that they indeed talked to officials in each agency. Second, the premise establishes the specific purpose of communicating with the officials in each agency—verifying the accuracy of the information. This specificity aligns with the hypothesis that the focus of these conversations was on fact-checking and ensuring that the information presented was accurate. It demonstrates a strong connection between the researchers' actions and the hypothesis. Third, the use of the term \\"case illustrations\\" implies that these agencies were selected for profiling and were not a comprehensive list of all agencies. This suggests that the researchers or individuals involved were thorough in their investigation and selection process and chose these specific agencies for a reason. The hypothesis, \\"We talked to officials in each agency to verify information,\\" further emphasizes this point by showcasing their dedication to obtaining accurate information for each selected agency. Furthermore, the premise indicates a level of trust and cooperation between the individuals involved in creating the case illustrations and the officials in each agency. The willingness of officials to verify the accuracy of the information they presented demonstrates that they acknowledged the importance of portraying their agencies accurately. Consequently, this supports the hypothesis that they communicated directly with officials from each agency to achieve this goal. Lastly, the premise implies that the information was based on direct conversations with knowledgeable insiders from each agency. This direct interaction lends additional support to the hypothesis that they talked to officials to verify information, as it suggests that interacting with agency officials was an essential step in collecting and validating the data. In conclusion, if the premise \\"We also asked officials in each of the agencies profiled as case illustrations to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their respective agencies\\" is true, it strongly supports the hypothesis that \\"We talked to officials in each agency to verify information.\\" It demonstrates the researchers' active approach, purpose-driven communication, trust and cooperation with agency officials, and reliance on insider knowledge to gather and verify accurate information for the case illustrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body.  Question: suppose Having a healthy body happens, how will it affect If kidneys lower their effectiveness.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the process The given process describes how the kidneys filter waste products out of the blood and make urine, which is then stored in the bladder. Clean blood is returned to the body. Step 2: Identify the effects The question consists of two parts: first, having a healthy body; second, kidneys lowering their effectiveness. Step 3: Analyze the effects 1. Having a healthy body signifies that all organs and systems are working efficiently and properly. 2. Kidneys lowering their effectiveness implies that they won't be able to filter waste products as effectively as they should, leading to the accumulation of these waste materials in the blood. Step 4: Determine the influence of the first effect on the second effect If having a healthy body happens, it means the kidneys are supposed to function properly. In this case, lowering their effectiveness will have a negative impact on overall health. Step 5: Assess the impact of the perturbation on the second effect The question asks how the supposed perturbation (having a healthy body) influences the second effect (kidneys lowering their effectiveness). Step 6: Choose the appropriate response A healthy body means that the kidneys should be working effectively. Therefore, if the kidneys actually lower their effectiveness in a healthy body, this will have some negative effect on the overall health. So, the influence on the second effect will be more effect, meaning that the decrease in kidney efficiency will make a more significant impact on the body's health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: May Day: workers of the world unite and take over - their factories A 19th-century slogan is getting a 21st-century makeover. The workers of the world really are uniting. At least, some of them are. The economic meltdown unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis hit southern Europe especially hard, sending manufacturing output plunging and unemployment soaring. Countless factories shut their gates. But some workers at perhaps as many as 500 sites across the continent – a majority in Spain, but also in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey – have refused to accept the corporate kiss of death. Related: May Day 2015: share your photos and videos By negotiation, or sometimes by occupation, they have taken production into their own hands, embracing a movement that has thrived for several years in Argentina. In France, an average of 30 mostly small companies a year, from phone repair firms to ice-cream makers, have become workers’ co-operatives since 2010. Coceta, a co-operative umbrella group in Spain, reckons that in 2013 alone some 75 Spanish companies were taken over by their former employees – roughly half the total in the whole of Europe. A gathering in Marseille last year of representatives from worker-controlled factories drew more than 200 delegates from more than a dozen countries – including pioneers from Argentina, whose turn-of-the-century economic crash sparked a wave of fabricas recuperadas that today has left around 15,000 workers in charge at more than 300 workplaces. The fast-developing phenomenon is now a field of academic study; there are websites, such as workerscontrol.net and autogestion.coop, dedicated to it. No two self-managed ventures launch in the same circumstances, and many face daunting obstacles: bureaucratic inertia and administrative red tape that can delay or even prevent production; legal opposition from former owners; a still-chilly economic climate; outdated machinery, or products no longer in demand. Lifelong union militants can find themselves, for the first time in their lives, making tough commercial decisions. But many – for the time being at least – are making it work. Twenty minutes’ drive from the old port of Marseille, on a green and well-groomed industrial park outside the Provençal village of Gémenos, is Fralib, the largest tea factory in France. Every year, 250-odd workers here turned six tonnes of carefully cured leaves into more than 2bn sachets of Lipton and Eléphant brand flavoured and scented teas – lemon, mint, Earl Grey – and soothing herbal infusions: linden, camomile, verbena. But in September 2010, having spent five years steadily shifting half the factory’s production to Poland, its owner, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever, summarily announced it was closing the site. “It was … shocking,” said Olivier Lerberquier, a CGT union convenor at the factory. “Unilever France had just paid a huge dividend to shareholders. Fralib, this place, was profitable, even at half capacity. We decided to fight.” It has been, by any standards, a long battle, but it seems nearly over: next month, 57 ex-Fralib employees, now reformed into a self-managed workers’ co-op, will switch on their machines again, and a factory silent for half a decade will once more produce tea. Standing four-square in the cavernous main production hall at Gémenos, as long-underemployed operators checked pristine machinery and freshly trained technicians tested new quality-control equipment, Leberquier said few in France would have bet on the factory’s remaining workers getting this far. “In the end, though, the length of the fight – 1,336 days, it was – almost helped us,” he said. “We got time to build solidarity, and a solid business plan. And even if, like our lawyer says, we’re now ‘condemned to succeed’, at least we know, for sure, that we have as good a chance as anyone.” The workers also got money. Unilever submitted four successive redundancy plans for the 182 people still employed at Fralib in 2010. All – including one proposal to relocate to Poland on an annual salary of €6,000 – were thrown out by the employment tribunal in Marseille. While more than half the workers, exhausted, eventually accepted a payoff, those who held out to the end were rewarded: first, the greater Marseille authority, keen to preserve jobs, agreed to buy the factory site from Unilever for €5m and pay a symbolic extra euro for the machinery. Then in June last year, the company agreed a remarkable €20m settlement to cover compensation for all unpaid wages, retraining, market research, brand promotion – and €1.5m of startup capital for the new business. “I won’t lie – it was hard,” said Xavier Imbernou, a machine operator retraining in quality control and food safety. “We went months without pay; dug deep into our savings. Whole families suffered. But we had such support, from around the country. Our struggle became symbolic.” Marie Sasso, who has been filling little sachets with Eléphant tea – the brand was first made near Marseille St Charles station in 1896 – since she was 17, said she never expected to find herself without a job at 55, “and never for a moment considered not fighting for it”. She said she was “counting the days till the machines restart. All this time we’ve been maintaining them, running them once a month to see they’re working. This time, when they start, it’ll be for us. No bosses. That’s what kept us going.” The Société Coopérative et Participative Thés et Infusions, or SCOP-TI, as the new venture is known, failed in two of its early objectives: Unilever rejected its suggestion that the factory continue to supply it with bulk tea on contract, and it refused to surrender the Eléphant brand. “We had to rethink, radically,” said Leberquier. The co-op’s new plan has it processing 350 tonnes of tea and infusions this year and 500-600 tonnes by 2017: enough to pay its members a fair wage. It is negotiating contracts with French supermarkets to supply fairtrade teas under their own labels, but is also developing a more upmarket own-brand range. “These are premium, organic, local or regional products,” said Leberquier. “The south of France used to produce 400 tonnes of linden a year; now it mostly comes from Latin America and the harvest here is barely 15 tonnes a year. We’ve already signed deals that will bring Provençal orchards back to life.” The former Fralib workers’ road to self-management has involved almost everyone learning something new. “You have to realise: we did production,” said Gerard Cazorla, 57, along with Leberquier a leading light in the struggle, and recently elected president of the co-op. “Purchasing, transport, marketing, sales, distribution – all of that was Unilever’s responsibility.” Roles have been decided “democratically, and actually quite naturally”, he said, through a horizontal structure of frequent general assemblies and an elected (and instantly dismissable) 11-person managing board. Some debates – salaries all equal or reflecting professional expertise? – have been tougher than others, Cazorla conceded. And the more militant members of the new co-operative – among them, he would be the first to admit, himself – have had to adjust to some uncomfortable realities. There was disquiet, for example, at the necessity of working directly with France’s famously ruthless big supermarket chains, and soul-searching at the prospect of a self-employed sales team working essentially on commission. “We have to be pragmatic,” Cazorla said. “Sometimes I have to take my union cap off. We have a big factory to run and 60 salaries to pay. We’re not going to change society. There’s still going to be capitalism. But we try to do what we’re doing as best we can, and according to our values.” In a small green space tucked between tall apartment buildings, two teenage girls giggle self-consciously as they begin singing softly into their microphones. A crowd forms around them, clapping along as the videographer calls out instructions. This hastily formed band is recording a video tribute to their city’s music school, which for five years has offered drum, piano and band lessons, among others, to around 800 students in Mataró, a small city 20 miles from Barcelona. Most music schools wouldn’t elicit a tribute, but Mataró is different. In 2012, the school was on the brink of closure, a victim of changing political priorities and cutbacks driven by Spain’s economic crisis. As the school’s 40 teachers prepared for imminent unemployment, the students and their families took to the streets to demand that local authorities kept the school open. Finally a compromise was reached: the school would continue but its management would be privatised. With little to lose, the school’s teachers decided to bid for the contract. “We just threw it together,” said piano teacher Aradia Sánchez de la Blanca. “The motivation was so pressing and the rage over everything we had been through was so intense that we started going down this path without thinking too much about the next steps.” From this kneejerk reaction Musicop was born, a co-operative that marries together music education and co-operative values. Their elation at winning the tender soon gave way to panic. “We went from basically being teachers to being members in a co-op,” said Sánchez de la Blanca. “All of a sudden we had to think about how we were going to organise ourselves, manage our finances - this was new for most of us.” Most members had no idea what it meant to be in a co-op, said teacher Montse Anguera Gisbert. “The first year involved a lot of swearing,” she said laughing. The co-operative is now in its third year and despite the steep learning curve and the country’s economic crisis, it is growing. Today the co-op offers classes to nearly 2,000 students in seven municipalities, bringing music education to students who range from 36 months old to octogenarians. The backbone of their growing enterprise is their monthly assemblies, where everything from management to expansion opportunities is on the table. To meet their obligation, Musicop has taken on another 40 or so part-time workers. Once there is enough fulltime work for these workers, the hope is that they can become members of the co-operative. As Musicop’s members grapple with the challenges of self-management, they have relied extensively on the resources around them. About a year ago, Musicop set up offices in Can Fugarolas, a repurposed car dealership and repair shop that now serves as headquarters for several other co-ops dealing in everything from solar energy to consumer goods – along with other community groups. The city of Mataró boasts a rich history of co-operatives, said Ignasi Gómez, president of Musicop. “The first co-operative launched here in the late 1800s,” he said, citing a co-op dedicated to construction launched in 1887. “Co-operatives are part of the local culture on many levels.” Spain today is home to some 18,000 co-operatives, a vibrant movement whose international face has often been that of Mondragon, one of the world’s biggest workers’ co-operatives. Founded by local priests in the Basque country in the 1950s, Mondragon today employs nearly 75,000 people and racked up global sales of more than €11.6bn in 2013. “Mondragon offers inspiration on what’s possible,” said Paloma Arroyo, of Coceta, a group that represents co-operatives in Spain. In 2013 alone, she said, some 75 companies across Spain were turned into co-operatives by their workers, out of 150 companies across Europe. On a Friday afternoon, Musicop’s teachers were spread out across Mataró, offering classes in four places. In a quiet primary school, pianos had been crammed into a small room where three girls were learning to play the theme song from Frozen. Elsewhere, another teacher had his hands full with eight pre-schoolerslearning the basics of rhythm in a class called Music and Movement. In an abandoned school that hosts many of Musicop’s classes in Mataró, more than a dozen pre-teens sang and waved their hands in the air as they wandered around a room singing along to Vivaldi. For 16-year-old Aida Garcia, the classes offer a window into a world she would have never known otherwise. “I love being in these classes,” she said, adding that her dream was to play clarinet in an orchestra. Propelled by the enthusiasm of their students, Musicop’s members have pushed forward, even though salaries dropped by 30% initially. They have begun climbing back up, and are now about 12% shy of what they were before, said Gómez. “The salaries we make are respectable, but not ideal,” he added. Even so, few members hesitate when asked if it was worth it. “We’re better off today, because we’re empowered,” said Gómez. Marius Kostopoulos was painstakingly dripping lemon essential oil into the 300-odd plastic bottles that he and his three colleagues had spent the past hour or so filling with all-purpose liquid household cleaner. This was not the job he was taken on to do in 2004 at Viome, a once highly profitable manufacturer of building supplies – ceramic tile adhesives and grouts, to be precise – on the industrial outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city. But Viome no longer really exists. Faced with the near-total collapse of the Greek construction industry, a consequent 40% slump in sales and a 30% increase in energy costs, its parent company, Philkeram-Johnson – majority owned by the local Philippou family– went spectacularly bust four years ago. Kostopoulos and his 45 fellow production workers were already working shorter hours. In May 2011, their pay cheques stopped coming (although they have never officially been made redundant, meaning they are deprived of even minimal Greek jobless benefits). Then in September that year, Philkeram-Johnson simply abandoned the site. So Kostopoulos and 20 of his colleagues are occupying its echoing, increasingly rundown machine halls and warehousing and – for the time being, at least – making a bit of money. “It certainly isn’t enough to survive on,” said Kostopoulos, whose wife, a daycare worker, is now at home looking after their 16-month-old son. “I need other work to get by, so I help out on evenings and weekends as a waiter at weddings, bar mitzvahs, that kind of thing. Other people’s festivities … But it’s up to half the €500 or €600 we live on each month. I couldn’t do without it.” When Philkeram-Johnson left, the workers’ first thought was to prevent the machinery and stock being taken by the company. If that disappeared, they feared, there would be no chance of them ever seeing the €1.5m they were owed in backpay and compensation. But what they really wanted, from the outset, was simply to keep working. “No one wants to be unemployed,” said Dimitris Koumatsioulis, 45, another ex-worker and founding co-operative member. “In Greece in particular, here and now, we couldn’t have another 45 workers unemployed, another 45 families deprived of an income.” At the very first of their general assemblies, a proposal to stay on in the factory and run it as a self-managed co-operative won 97% approval. A delegation of workers went to Athens for talks with the employment ministry; the Philippou family, majority owners of Philkeram-Johnson, made it clear they did not envisage restarting production on the site. By mid-2012 the Viome workers had contacted solidarity networks in Greece and abroad, exploring the possibility of producing a range of environmentally friendly soaps, washing-up liquids, softeners and detergents. The products had to be cheap to make, using existing machinery and raw materials that were simple to source. Local citizens’ associations and unions promised to distribute a proportion of the factory’s output, followed by many of the dozens of small co-operative stores and markets then starting to spring up around Greece as the country’s formal economy spiralled downwards. In February 2013, after a three-day solidarity event in Thessaloniki that included a benefit concert attended by more than 6,000 people, production at Viome restarted under the workers’ control, and in April last year a court recognised them as a legally constituted, not-for-profit social co-operative. Viome products are now sold through charity and solidarity networks in Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. Its co-operative statutes, which emphasise the key principles of collective decision-making and ownership, refer to the venture’s “solidarity supporters”: organisations and individuals who have pledged to purchase a percentage of the factory’s output every year. The co-operative has fought a series of court cases against Philkeram-Johnson and the Philippou family, who have repeatedly said they have no plans to use the factory themselves but now want to sell the land to pay off outstanding debts to banks, suppliers and employees. Greece’s new radical left government is considering legislation allowing workers to legally take over factories abandoned by their owners. But ultimately, said Koumatsioulis: “We don’t want to hide it: above and beyond our own jobs and our families’ futures, this is about equality, democracy, the whole employer-employee relationship.” If Viome eventually succeeded in its target of producing up to a tonne a day of soaps, detergents and cleaning fluids, said Kostopoulos, “we’ll be better off here – psychologically, politically, economically – than we ever were when we had bosses. We’re working for each other. That’s the difference”. All his life José Pereyra had been a waiter. For 20 years he served tables at Los Chanchitos (The Little Piggies), an old-style parrila (grill) at a strategic corner in Buenos Aires, on the borderline between two of the most densely populated middle-class neighbourhoods of the city. Specialising in finger-licking grilled pork and generous helpings of homemade pasta, and with a faithful clientele that had kept it in business for three decades, Pereyra expected Los Chanchitos to provide firm job security. But two years ago Pereyra realised its proprietors, who owned four other restaurants, were heading for a crash. “They owed rent on the building, they owed us back wages and had fallen behind on our social benefits payments,” said Pereyra. “I realised they were planning to close Los Chanchitos behind our backs.” In previous decades, there would have been little Pereyra could have done to save his own job and that of his 27 other co-workers. But after Argentina’s cataclysmic economic collapse in 2001, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt and the government impounded all bank savings accounts, so many firms went into bankruptcy that workers were forced to find innovative solutions to save their jobs. “Faced with the closures, instead of folding their arms and going home, many workers took the decision to form co-operatives,” said Andrés Quintana, spokesperson for CNCT, the National Confederation of Work Co-operatives.Worker-managed firms existed before the crash. “There are probably between 5,000 and 6,000 co-operatives in Argentina today,” said Quintana. “The largest growth has been in recent years.” They provide jobs for more than 60,000 people. For many, such as Pereyra, who worked the night shift at Los Chanchitos, forming a co-operative was a matter of survival. “I remember the date, 23 April 2013, I spent all afternoon wandering around trying to figure out what to do,” Pereyra recalled. “The owners were pulling out and we had to take a decision. That night I called together all the waiters and the rest of the staff and proposed forming a co-operative.” The restaurant’s employees kept the takings from that night and the next day, but when the meat and vegetable suppliers arrived, Pereyra took his first brave step. He informed the suppliers that the employees had taken over the restaurant and that daily deliveries would be paid in cash from then on. The switch is not an easy one. “It’s a very difficult process for workers,” said Quintana. “Some are suddenly thrust from behind the counter to putting on a suit and going to work out a deal with the bank.” “The first months were very rough, I was a traumatic wreck,” confessed Pereyra, 50. “But we had no other choice, our jobs were at stake. Many of us were over 45and would have had a hard time finding work again. For the first nine months I had to sleep at Los Chanchitos to get the business on its feet.” On a larger scale, the workers at the large Bernardi oil storage plant in the Dock Sud area of the port of Buenos Aires were forced to take the firm over after it went bankrupt as Argentina’s economy imploded 14 years ago. “It was a typical case of a company that collapsed during the 2001 crisis,” said José Sancha, of Decosur, the 30-member co-operative that now runs the formerly privately owned plant. Decosur stores gas oil, petrol and fuel oil that is unloaded from tankers arriving at Buenos Aires in its 42 tanks with a combined capacity of 39,000 cubic metres.“The first years were very tough,” Sancha recalled. “It’s an activity that requires meeting strict environmental norms, dealing with very diverse clients and securing the necessary concessions with the port authorities.” But once the switch had been completed, business blossomed for the new cooperative. “We have now expanded to include an adjacent lot owned by another firm and we have even put in a pipe that connects us directly to the Dock Sud power plant,” said Sancha. Decosur now pipes liquid fuel to the 775-megawatt plant that feeds electric energy to a large slice of Buenos Aires. Umbrella groups such as CNCT have stepped in to smooth the bumpy transition. “We provide training tools, we set up networks, many firms have fallen by the wayside,” said Quintana. “The most complicated part for us was the legal settlement with the previous owners,” said Pereyra, who continues waiting at tables despite his new business role. A pleasant surprise that followed after the co-operative took over was the return of many clients lost as the quality of the food dropped when the previous owners stopped reinvesting in the restaurant. “If you stop paying your cook on time and you lower the quality of the meat, the client notices straight away. But when they saw that things started improving after we took over they started coming back.” Unlike a normal business, which must turn a profit for its owner, a co-operative run by its workers tends to provide better conditions for its employees. “We don’t retire our older employees, we find other tasks for them,” Pereyera said. “One of us needed surgery which he couldn’t afford, for example. So we got together between us and decided that the co-operative would cover the operation, because he had been working at the restaurant for 20 years. As a matter of fact, he just had the operation yesterday. A normal business maybe wouldn’t have cared, but we did.” At a first glance, the workshop appears to be a run-of-the-mill textile factory. Long lines of knitting and weaving machines dominate the hall, while boxes filled with garments and colourful spindles of yarn are piled up in corners.But Özgür Kazova is not like any other factory in Turkey: the four workers perched over their tables, sewing, ironing and supervising the whirring machinery, do not answer to any bosses. Their struggle began in early 2013, when the owners of Kazova Textiles, Ümit and Mustafa Somuncu, put all 95 workers on leave after withholding their pay for several months, blaming poor business conditions. The workers were told they would receive all back-paylater, but upon their return they were informed by the company lawyer that everyone had been dismissed without compensation for “unaccounted absence from work”. “We were dumbstruck,” said Aynur Aydemir who worked at Kazova Textiles for more than eight years. “Up until then we had been working seven days a week, up to 10 hours a day. Business seemed to be thriving. It was hard to believe that the company was really too broke to pay us.” What was more, the owners dismantled all working machinery overnight and disappeared together with more than 100,000 finished jumpers and 40 tonnes of high-quality yarn, leaving the unpaid and now unemployed workers with knitting machines that were almost half a century old and did not work properly. At the end of April, a handful of the former Kazova Textiles employees set up a tent in front of the old factory in order to prevent the owners taking the remaining valuables inside. Undeterred by what they said were threats and intimidation from the owners and the police, their reluctant struggle grew into a full-blown political movement. “At first we were timid, because we had never been involved in any political movement before,” Serkan Gönüs, 42, explained. “We were scared, but little by little our confidence grew when we saw how much support we had from bystanders during those demonstrations.” In the aftermath of Turkey’s protests in the spring of 2013, the workers decided to occupy and reopen the factory. A court ruled that the machines should go to the workers in compensation for their lost wages, and Muzaffer Yigit, 43, who has worked for Kazova Textiles since 1990, set out to repair them. Using the yarn that the old owners had left behind, the first jumpers, branded Diren Kazova (Resist Kazova), were produced. In September, the group hosted its first public fashion show. But discord led to a split, and four workers decided to found the co-operative Free Kazova. “We found that it was not enough to just talk about workers’ rights and resistance in theory,” Gönüs said. “We wanted to come up with a sustainable model for fairer work, and be able to support ourselves.” The Free Kazova workers have reached out to other self-managed factories and co-operatives worldwide in order to share experiences and expertise. Their aim is to produce high-quality, affordable garments for everyone interested in supporting a labour model that presents an alternative to exploitative wage work, with customers being told exactly how the money paid for each jumper is used. “We don’t want to work for a profit, just enough for all of us to get by,” Aynur Aydemir said. “We work six hours a day, and we like coming to work in the morning now, because we are our own bosses.” She added that Özgür Kazova jumpers were now sold not only in Turkey, but in France, Italy and Poland. “It’s actually hard to keep up with demand,” she laughed. “It proves that we are on the right track, and that many people agree with us and what we are defending.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The article discusses the rising trend among workers across the globe who are taking ownership and control of their factories when corporate owners decide to shut them down. This is a result of a resurgence in workers' cooperatives, which has grown stronger in recent years, especially in southern European countries that were hard hit by the 2008 financial crisis. The phenomenon began to thrive in Argentina and is now spreading to countries like Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. The article details the experiences of several worker-controlled factories and cooperatives, negotiating various obstacles such as bureaucratic inertia, outdated machinery and, sometimes, products no longer in demand. Despite these challenges, many such cooperatives have managed to successfully take over and operate the businesses while adhering to their guiding principles of collective decision-making and ownership."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As in: “I don’t understand. Is it a guy dressed up like a girl? Or a girl dressed up like a guy?” They are obsolete.      (MORE: It’s a Man’s World, and It Always Will Be)      Once upon a time, the men ventured out to hunt bison while the women stayed behind to dust the cave, gather berries and raise the very hairy children. This is the story we have told ourselves for tens of thousands of years to explain why men rule the world while women are relegated to being the second sex, (“physiologically unsuited for leadership” is how the current Australian prime minister put it). Now after more than a century of global economic revolutions and a few decades of recession it’s become obvious that this story is no longer true, if it ever was.

View Sample Sign Up Now      ONE: It’s the end of men because men are failing in the workplace.      Over the last few decades men’s incomes have been slowly declining and women’s have been rising. Last year one in five men were not working, something economists call the biggest social crisis we will face. Party this is because the economy is changing quickly, but men aren’t. As the manufacturing economy gets replaced by a service and information economy, men are failing to adjust or get the skill they need to succeed.      Meanwhile, women are moving in the opposite direction: In 2009 they became the majority of the American workforce for the first time ever. Now in every part of America young single women under 30 have a higher median income than young men, which is really important because that’s the phase of life when people imagine what their future will look like. As one sorority girl put it to me — remember, I said sorority, not someone from the women’s study center — “Men are the new ball and chain.”      It’s the end of men because men are failing in schools and women are succeeding. In nearly every country, on all but one continent, women are getting 60 percent of college degrees, which is what you need to succeed these days. Many boys start falling behind as early as first grade, and they fail to catch up. Many men, meanwhile, still see school as a waste of time, a girl thing.      (MORE: The Real Significance of Mary Barra)      TWO: It’s the end of men because the traditional household, propped up by the male breadwinner, is vanishing.      For the first time in history women all over the world are marrying down, meaning marrying men with worse prospects than they have. We have a new global type, for example, called the alpha wife, a woman who makes more money than her husband or boyfriend. Not that long ago she was exceedingly rare. Now she’s part of about 40 percent of couples in the US. And that does not count the growing number of single moms who head their own families.      Women are occupying positions of power that were once totally closed off to them. The premiers of the Canada’s four biggest provinces, the head of Harvard, the COO of Facebook, the newly appointed chairwoman of the Fed, ruler of the global economy, Janet Yellen, who got the job basically because Larry Summers said women weren’t that good at math. And lets not forget Christine Lagarde, who took over the job at the IMF from another shining example of modern manhood.      And why aren’t there more female CEO’s or heads of state, one of you will ask? To that I have to remind you that women’s ascendance is only about 40 years old, while men have been in power for 40,000 years. So by that standard we are rising at dizzying speeds.      THREE: It’s the end of men because we can see it in the working and middle class.      When I speak at public universities with commuter populations about the disappearance of men, the women find what I am saying to be totally obvious, like the sky is blue and Miley Cyrus is whacked. The working class feels the end of men the most, as men lose their jobs and lose their will to be fathers, and women do everything alone, creating a virtual matriarchy in the parts of the country that used to be bastions of good old macho country music style values. Why don’t these women marry or live with the fathers of their children? As many a woman told me, “He’d be just another mouth to feed.”      (MORE: Sorry, Camille Paglia: Feminism Is the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Men)      FOUR: It’s the end of men because men have lost their monopoly on violence and aggression.      Women are becoming more sexually confident, and something Camille Paglia has been waiting for, more aggressive and violent in both good ways and bad — that is, going to war, going to jail, and in the case of the Real Housewives of New Jersey, beating up anyone who knocks a drink out of their hand.      FIVE: It’s the end of men because men, too, are now obsessed with their body hair.

I mean, he has called the exterminator and made sure the weeds are dead and gone. And if you asked him, “Why are you so shorn, Mr. Weiner?” do you think he would say the matriarchy made me do it? No he would not, and neither should we.      Obsolete does not mean worthless. It means outmoded. The twin combustion engine made the bicycle obsolete but that doesn’t mean we hate the bicycle. We just use it the way we want to, while recognizing the necessity of efficiency and change. We don’t have to turn men into eunuchs. We can keep whatever we like about manhood but adjust the parts of the definition that are keeping men back.      I dedicated my book to my son because he is one of those boys who gets in trouble a lot, who thinks the institutions are rigged against him. I see my job as accepting him as he is, and teaching him how to adapt to the world as it is.      When I think of the world after the end of men, I think of the world my son will inherit, where, if he chooses to take his kids to a playground at 3 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, no one will look at him funny, no one will wonder if he’s out of work, no one will think, “What a loser,” and no one will think he’s from Portland or Toronto, they will just walk on by and not think anything of it at all.

Adapted from her opening statement at the Munk Debate, “Resolved: Men Are Obsolete,” held in Toronto. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the idea that men are becoming obsolete due to various economic, social, and cultural changes happening around the world. The author, Hanna Rosin, presents five reasons to support this claim: 1. Men are failing in the workplace. Men's incomes have been declining while women's have been rising. As the manufacturing economy is replaced by service and information economies, men are failing to adjust or get the skills they need to succeed. 2. The traditional male breadwinner model is vanishing. Women are now marrying down, meaning marrying men with worse prospects than they have. Alpha wives, women who make more money than their husbands or boyfriends, are becoming more common. 3. The end of men can be seen in the working and middle classes. Men lose their jobs and lose their will to be fathers, and women take on all responsibilities alone, creating a virtual matriarchy in the parts of the country that used to be bastions of macho country music-style values. 4. Men have lost their monopoly on violence and aggression. Women are becoming more sexually confident, more aggressive and violent in both good ways and bad - going to war, going to jail, and physically fighting. 5. Men are now obsessed with their body hair. Men have adopted traditionally feminine concerns about grooming and appearance, as seen in the meticulously groomed chest of Anthony Weiner. Rosin suggests that men must adapt to these changes by keeping the aspects of manhood they like while adjusting the parts that are holding them back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder A:","output":"The final step of the process outlined above involves the elimination of the urine from the bladder through the process called micturition or urination. Here's a detailed explanation of the step: 1. Urine storage and preparation for elimination: After urine production in the kidneys, it is transported to the bladder via the ureters, which are muscular tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder. The bladder serves as a temporary storage organ for urine. As the bladder fills up with urine, its walls expand to contain the increasing volume, and specialized nerves in the bladder wall sense the stretching and produce an urge to urinate. 2. Activation of the micturition reflex: This urge to urinate increases as the bladder reaches its maximum capacity, ultimately triggering the micturition reflex. This reflex involves the activation of both the involuntary and voluntary nervous systems. The involuntary nervous system initiates the contraction of the detrusor muscle (a smooth muscle layer in the bladder wall) when the bladder is full and the internal urethral sphincter (an involuntary smooth muscle ring) around the neck of the bladder relaxes. 3. Voluntary control over urination: Alongside the automatic micturition reflex, individuals have voluntary control over urination through the relaxation and contraction of the external urethral sphincter. The external urethral sphincter is a circular ring of skeletal muscle surrounding the urethra and is under an individual's conscious control. Once a person decides it is an appropriate time and place to urinate, the brain sends signals to this muscle to relax. 4. Urine elimination: With voluntary relaxation of the external urethral sphincter and the contraction of the detrusor muscle, urine is forced through the urethra. The urethra is the tube that leads from the bladder to the exterior of the body. In males, the urethra is longer and passes through the prostate gland and the penis, while in females, it is shorter and opens in front of the vaginal opening. As urine flows through the urethra, it carries the waste products away from the body, completing the process. In summary, the final step in this process is the elimination of urine from the bladder through the urethra during the act of micturition or urination. This step involves a combination of involuntary muscle contractions (in the detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter) and voluntary control over the external urethral sphincter, ultimately leading to the expulsion of urine and waste products from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"These are lists of the busiest airports in the United States.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"While the phrase \\"These are lists of the busiest airports in the United States.\\" provides an indication that there are lists available to identify the busiest airports in the US, it does not directly answer the question or provide sufficient information about which specific airport holds the title as the busiest. A more detailed and comprehensive answer would be: The Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is currently considered the busiest airport in the United States. This designation is based on the total number of passengers and aircraft movements. Located in Atlanta, Georgia, it serves as a major hub for domestic and international flights, connecting the US to a multitude of global destinations. In 2020, the airport handled more than 42 million passengers, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a significant decrease in air travel. This figure is based on data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airports Council International (ACI). Moreover, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is not only the busiest airport in the United States but also holds the distinction of being the busiest airport in the world. It has held this title for over two decades, largely due to its strategic location and accessibility, as well as the airline presence. The airport serves as a major hub for Delta Air Lines, which is one of the largest airlines globally, operating more than 1,000 daily flights from Atlanta alone. Despite being the busiest airport in the US, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has consistently demonstrated high efficiency, with its operational system and infrastructure designed to handle a large volume of passengers and aircraft movements seamlessly.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Pain during urination and a need to go frequently and urgently are the main early signs of a UTI. If you notice these symptoms in yourself or someone in your care, schedule an appointment with a health care provider right away. You may feel the urgent need to urinate, but only pass a very small amount. Urine may appear cloudy, pink, red, or dark brown with a UTI. If you notice that your urine, or the urine of someone in your care, has an unusual appearance, schedule a visit with a healthcare provider. If you are using a catheter, hold the bag up to the light to check if it is clear. If you see cloudy residue, this may be a sign of a urinary tract infection in its early stages. If you have a UTI, your urine may smell strong or unpleasant. See a doctor if you notice that your urine smells bad, particularly if the smell is accompanied by other symptoms of infection (such as pain during urination or discolored urine). Some foods, like asparagus, can also affect the odor of your urine. For women, a UTI may cause pain in the center of the pelvis, in the area of the pubic bone. Pelvic pain can also be a sign of some other serious condition. Schedule an appointment with your doctor if you or someone in your care experiences pelvic pain. UTIs in their early stages may cause a variety of other symptoms in the elderly, some of which may mimic other conditions. Schedule an appointment with a health care provider if you notice:  Confusion. Light-headedness. Pale skin. A low-grade fever. For someone using a catheter, do a daily temperature check to catch any signs of infection early.

Tämä tarkoittaa, että ehdotetun laajennuksen loppuminen ajoittuu samaan ajankohtaan, jolloin on odotettavissa, että Euroopan komissio päättää EU:n rahoituksen rokoteohjelmalle, joka pyrkii kitkemään raivotautia villieläimistä tietyissä jäsenmaissa. Näin ollen on järkevää, että nämä kaksi tapahtumaa ovat samankaltaisia ajallisesti, jotta voidaan varmistaa johdonmukaisuus ja tehokkuus taistelussa tätä tautia vastaan. Raivotauti on vakava ja usein kuolemaan johtava virustauti, joka vaikuttaa keskushermostoon ja leviää yleensä syljen välityksellä. EU on sitoutunut torjumaan tätä tautia villieläimissä rokoteohjelman avulla, joka perustuu rokotteiden levittämiseen esimerkiksi riistanruokintapaikoille, jotta mahdollisimman moni eläin saavutetaan ja rokotetaan. Tämänkaltaiset ohjelmat ovat olleet tehokkaita monissa maissa, ja niiden avulla on saatu vähennettyä raivotaudin esiintyvyyttä huomattavasti. Ehdotetun laajennuksen päättymisen ja EU-rahoituksen loppumisen yhteensovittaminen on tärkeää, jotta voidaan arvioida ohjelmien tehokkuutta ja päättää niiden jatkamisesta mahdollisimman hyvin informoitujen päätösten pohjalta. Lisäksi se antaa jäsenvaltioille mahdollisuuden valmistautua rahoituksen loppumiseen ja pohtia vaihtoehtoisia rahoitusmalleja, mikäli tällaiset raivotautirokoteohjelmat osoittautuvat edelleen tarpeellisiksi. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että ehdotetun laajennuksen päättymisen ajoitus on tärkeä osatekijä EU:n pyrkimyksissä torjua raivotautia sen jäsenvaltioissa. Tämä antaa mahdollisuuden arvioida rokotusohjelmien tehokkuutta ja tehdä tarvittavia päätöksiä niiden jatkamisesta, samalla kun jäsenvaltiot voivat valmistautua EU-rahoituksen loppumiseen ja miettiä vaihtoehtoisia rahoitusvaihtoehtoja tulevaisuudessa."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

A hydrocarbon that doubles its carbon atoms will cause an decrease or increase in the amount of isomers? The answer is:","output":"An increase in the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will cause an increase in the number of isomers. To understand this, let us first delve into what hydrocarbons and isomers are, and how they are related to each other. Hydrocarbons are compounds consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds with other atoms, while hydrogen atoms can form one covalent bond. Hydrocarbons are classified into two main categories: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be further divided into three subcategories—alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes—based on the type of carbon-carbon bonds they have (single, double, or triple bonds, respectively). Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, meaning they have the same number of constituent atoms, but with differing arrangements of atoms. There are two types of isomers: structural isomers, which differ in the order that atoms are bonded, and stereoisomers, which contain the same order of atom bonding but differ in the spatial arrangement of the atoms. Structural isomers can be further divided into chain isomers, position isomers, and functional group isomers. As the number of carbon atoms increases in a hydrocarbon, the number of possible isomers also increases. This is because there is a greater potential for different arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms within the molecule. For example, with only one carbon atom, there is only one possible hydrocarbon, methane (CH4). However, when the number of carbon atoms increases to three (e.g., in the case of propane, C3H8), two isomers are possible: propane and cyclopropane. As we go further along the carbon atom chain, the number of possible isomers increases exponentially. When a hydrocarbon doubles its carbon atoms, the increased complexity resulting from the additional carbon atoms allows for more unique arrangements of atoms within the molecule, thereby leading to an increase in the number of isomers. This increase in isomer quantity can have significant implications on the physical and chemical properties of the different isomers, including boiling and melting points, solubility, and reactivity. In summary, as the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon increases, so does the number of possible isomers. This relationship holds true when a hydrocarbon doubles its carbon atoms: there will be an increase in the amount of isomers due to the greater potential for differing arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms within the molecule. Overall, the study of isomers is crucial in understanding the diverse properties and behaviors of hydrocarbons and their myriad applications in chemistry, biology, and industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.  Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.

This condition occurs due to inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes, which is the opposite of Danny's condition, hypercalcaemia, which is characterized by excessive calcium levels."},{"instruction":"A young woman was at the cinema,and she was enjoying the film very much.In the next seat there was an old man,and he began looking on the floor under him.The woman was angry and whispered ,\\"What are you doing now?

Movie plot title: Mysterious Island Movie plot: In 1865 during the American Civil War, a massive storm sweeps through a Confederate prison camp. Union soldiers Cyrus Harding (Michael Craig), Herbert Brown (Michael Callan) and Neb (Dan Jackson) are planning an escape via a gas balloon tethered next to the compound. When a new prisoner, Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet (Gary Merrill), is brought into their cell, they knock out the guards and escape from the prison house. Once they arrive at the balloon, they drag one of the Confederate guards named Pencroft (Percy Herbert) aboard. After he explains that he knows how to pilot the balloon, they let him join the group. The balloon carries them westwards across the U.S., and it isn't long before they discover that they are over the Pacific Ocean. A storm arises; the balloon tears open and leaks a significant amount of gas, forcing it into descending and eventually running aground near the shore of an unknown island. The following morning the men reunite and begin to explore the strange island they find themselves upon. They discover that the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt. When they reach the other side of the island, they encounter a monstrous crab. After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner. Afterwards, the men continue exploring and find a herd of wild goats which they try to catch. Then they find two unconscious English ladies, Lady Mary Fairchild (Joan Greenwood) and her niece Elena (Beth Rogan), who were shipwecked here by the same storm.

Wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the Cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as Wrigley Field. (The ballpark is long gone, but a clubhouse built by Wrigley to house the Cubs exists as the Catalina County Club.) However, by 1951 the team chose to leave Catalina Island and spring training was shifted to Mesa, Arizona. The Cubs' 30-year association with Catalina is chronicled in the book, The Cubs on Catalina, by Jim Vitti . . . which was named International 'Book of the Year' by The Sporting News.

The battle that took place on 26 July 1566 during the Northern Seven Years' War and was a slight victory for a Swedish fleet over a combined Danish and Lübecker fleet. It began just east of Öland and the Allied fleet eventually retreated toward Gotland. Two days after the battle a storm sank fourteen of the Allied ships while they were anchored near Visby, drowning around 5900 men. The Swedish fleet, further out to sea, returned to port with some damage. On 25 July, Horn discovered the Allied Danish-Lübeck fleet at the northern tip of Öland, headed for Gotland. Horn, who had a headwind, decided to avoid battle, but when the wind turned he started the battle on the morning of 26 July. A few more losses did not affect either fleet, when a sudden wind made it impossible for the Swedish navy to continue its pursuit of the Danish fleet, which was anchored to the Gotland coast to bury the Danish vice-admiral Christopher Morgisen on hallowed ground after his death from a cannonball. Shortly after that a sudden storm broke out. The Swedish navy, which was at sea, survived without major losses, other than having had to fell the main mast of the Hector, and was able to flee to Älvsnabben by 6 AUgust. The Allied fleet however was thrown against the coast of Gotland, and 12 Danish and 3 Lübeck vessels were smashed, and most of the ships' crews, numbering around 5000, were drowned, with only around 1400 surviving ashore.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Rarities is a compilation album by Australian rock band The Living End . The album features demos and acoustic versions of songs that were previously unreleased , and was first available on a range of online music stores for 5 days from 15 to 19 November 2008 , at which point it was taken off the stores for no confirmed reason . The album was exclusively released online , until its physical release as part of a 2 × CD deluxe edition of the band 's fifth studio album , White Noise , which was released on 27 February 2009 .  - Scott Bradley Owen (born 14 February 1975) plays the double bass in the Australian punk rock/psychobilly band The Living End.  - The double bass or simply the bass (and numerous other names) is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. It is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than sounding to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E, A, D and G. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family.  - The Living End are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1994. Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and \\"State of Emergency\\" (4 February 2006). They have also gained chart success in the United States and United Kingdom.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Christopher John Cheney (born 2 January 1975) is an Australian rock musician, record producer and studio owner. He is the founding mainstay guitarist, songwriter and lead vocalist of the psychobilly band, The Living End, which was formed in 1994 with school mate Scott Owen. Cheney wrote the group's top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart: \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" (1997), \\"All Torn Down\\" (1999), \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" (2000), \\"Roll On\\" (2001), \\"One Said to the Other\\" (2003), \\"What's on Your Radio\\" (2005), \\"Wake Up\\" (2006) and \\"White Noise\\" (2008). In 2004 Cheney joined the super group The Wrights which put out a cover version of Stevie Wright's epic 11-minute track, \\"Evie\\" as a single. At the APRA Awards of 2009 Cheney won 'Song of the Year' for writing The Living End's track, \\"White Noise\\". In 2005 he married Emma, the couple have two daughters and are co-owners of a recording facility, Red Door Studios. In 2011 the Cheney family relocated to Los Angeles.  - Andrew Douglas Strachan (born 20 August 1974) is an Australian rock musician. In 1994, after growing up in Adelaide, he relocated to Melbourne where in 2000 he became the drummer of alternative rock group, Pollyanna. In 2002, he joined fellow alternative rockers, The Living End, they have issued four Top 5 albums on the ARIA Charts, \\"Modern Artillery\\" (No 3 in 2003), \\"State of Emergency\\" (No. 1 in 2006), \\"White Noise\\" (No. 2 in 2008) and \\"The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating\\" (No. 3 in 2011).  - \\"Prisoner of Society\\" is a song by The Living End. The song was originally released in Australia on the 1997 EP \\"Second Solution/Prisoner of Society\\". It was later released as a single, separate from \\"Second Solution\\", in the United Kingdom in 1998.    What is the relationship between 'rarities ' and 'alternative rock'? A:","output":"The relationship between \\"Rarities\\" and \\"alternative rock\\" lies in the musical genre and context of the compilation album's content. \\"Rarities\\" is a compilation album by The Living End, an Australian band known for their punk rock and alternative rock influences. The album consists of demos and acoustic versions of previously unreleased songs, showcasing the band's alternative rock style. Alternative rock is a genre that emerged in the 1980s and gained widespread popularity in the 1990s, characterized by its diverse range of sounds, subgenres, and non-mainstream approach compared to popular rock music.

Please answer the following question: There used to be a term that was used to describe someone who drove their vehicles down the highway while staring at the scenery. These drivers just drove slowly, taking their own sweet time, as if they had nothing to do and no place in particular to go. Thus, the expression, \\" _ \\", was born. Consequently, a Sunday driver wasn't necessarily someone who was driving on a Sunday. A person could be a Sunday driver any day of the week. _ . The expression probably came about because there was a time when people would often decide to go for a relaxing drive on Sunday afternoons. A Sunday drive was a common occurrence years ago and especially on a nice warm sunny day. There were no stores open on Sunday because of the \\"blue laws\\", so you needed to be sure and fill up the gas tank and make any other needed purchases before Sunday arrived. Some of the states had strict blue laws that even prohibited some activities on Sunday. However, there is still a lot to be said for the slow, gentle life that once existed. It was a time when very few people worked on Sunday except for those professions vital to our well-being such as those in the medical profession. It was a day \\"set apart\\" that was used to rest, visit with neighbors and friends, or maybe go to grandma's house for supper.

Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \\"coalition of the willing\\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \\"smoking guns\\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \\"major combat operations\\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \\"democratization\\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What does WMD stand for?","output":"WMD stands for Weapons of Mass Destruction.

New York (CNN) -- This weekend's Iraqi election is testing the strength of the nation's young democracy and could be a turning point in the history of the Middle East, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In the March 7 election, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition in the Iraqi parliament is seeking to win enough votes to keep him in office for another term. On Thursday, a series of insurgent attacks led to the deaths of 29 people in the city of Baquba. Zakaria said the election could have a lasting impact: \\"It might be the turning point in the rise of Iraq in the Middle East. Iraq is one of the largest, most important countries in the Arab world. It has the third or fourth largest petroleum reserves in the world. Even now it has 40 billion in oil revenues every year; it has a well-trained army thanks to the Americans. So what","output":"happens in this election will not only shape the future of Iraq but also potentially redefine its role and influence in the region and beyond. With stakes so high, both domestic and international players are closely monitoring the electoral outcome. For the United States and its coalition partners, a stable, democratic, and reliable Iraq is crucial to their interests in maintaining regional security and countering the increasing influence of Iran. Additionally, the ongoing conflict in neighboring Syria only adds to the importance of Iraq becoming regional stability. Iraq shares a large border with Syria, and a stable Iraqi government is essential to prevent the spillover of the Syrian conflict into the broader region. As the world watches, the outcome of this election will speak volumes about the resilience and prospects of Iraq's young democracy, and whether the years of bloodshed, sacrifice, and nation-building efforts have paved the way for a brighter future. The electoral campaigns are marked by a fierce competition between the incumbent Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition and its challengers, with each faction vying for power and advocating different political, economic, and social agendas. Issues, such as national reconciliation, post-ISIS reconstruction, economic development, and power-sharing between different ethnic and religious groups, are at the heart of electoral debates. The ability of the incoming government to address these challenges will likely determine its success in solidifying the democratic process and the legitimacy of the state institutions. Moreover, the election's legitimacy will be judged by the level of voter participation and the transparency of the electoral process. A high turnout and a peaceful atmosphere on election day will be significant indicators of the public's confidence in the electoral system and their willingness to engage in the democratic process. Conversely, low voter turnout or incidents of violence and voter intimidation may serve to undermine the election's credibility and calls into question the stability and effectiveness of Iraq's democratic transition. In many ways, this election is a litmus test for how far Iraq has come since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the American-led occupation. The nation has struggled to overcome political, security, and sectarian challenges as it has attempted to rebuild its social fabric, economy, and political institutions. As such, the overall success of the election and the incoming government's ability to address the various challenges facing Iraq will also shape future international support for the country. In conclusion, the upcoming Iraqi election is a crucial moment for the nation's young democracy and is poised to mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. The stakes are high, and the outcome will not only influence the fate of Iraq but also have far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the region as a whole. A successful, transparent, and peaceful election will demonstrate the resilience of Iraq's democratic institutions and signal that the country is on the right track to becoming a stable, prosperous, and influential player in the Middle East. However, a failure to hold a credible election or a continuation of the current challenges facing the nation may be an ominous sign that Iraq's hard-won progress could be at risk and further strain an already fragile region.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Snakes on a Plane Movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system.

Question: \\"Of Uranus and Neptune, who is closer to the sun?\\"  Context: \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Uranus is closer to the Sun than Neptune. In the context provided, it is mentioned that Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, which means that Uranus is the closer of the two planets to the Sun. The context delves into the differences in the internal heating of Uranus and Neptune and how it impacts their respective weather conditions. Despite being farther from the Sun and receiving only 40% of its amount of sunlight, Neptune's surface temperature is approximately equal to that of Uranus. The temperatures vary within the different layers of Neptune's atmosphere, with the upper regions of its troposphere having a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3°C) and temperatures increasing deeper inside the layers. The source of heating for both Uranus and Neptune remains unknown; however, the disparity in energy is larger for Neptune. While Uranus radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives. This higher internal energy of Neptune is powerful enough to create the strongest planetary winds in the Solar System. One hypothesis for this difference in heating could be the leftover heat from Neptune's formation. Although this explanation could potentially account for Neptune's higher heat flow, it does not clarify why Uranus lacks the same level of internal heat, given the apparent similarities between the two planets. In conclusion, Uranus is closer to the Sun than Neptune, but the interesting aspect of these two planets lies in the differences in their internal heating and associated weather conditions. Neptune's significantly higher internal heating, despite being farther from the Sun, leads to more varied and intense weather phenomena compared to Uranus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeffrey was in a wonderful relationship unlike Matthew because","output":"Jeffrey was in a wonderful relationship unlike Matthew because he had taken the time and effort to truly understand what made a relationship work. He had spent a great deal of time learning about himself, his partner, and the essential ingredients for a strong and healthy bond. From the very beginning, Jeffrey prioritized open communication with his partner, Alison. They discussed their feelings, desires, goals, and fears openly and honestly. Neither one was afraid to be vulnerable, and this willingness to open up allowed their bond to deepen and strengthen as they both supported each other in every aspect of life. Jeffrey and Alison also took the time to express their appreciation and love for each other regularly. They never hesitated to share their feelings and acknowledged each other's achievements and efforts. Acts of love and gratitude became a foundation in their relationship, instilling a sense of trust and security in both of them. Additionally, Jeffrey made sure that they maintained a healthy work-life balance, understanding that spending quality time together is essential for any relationship to thrive. They went on regular date nights, pursued hobbies and interests together, and always took the time to simply enjoy each other's company. They intuitively understood that these moments were instrumental in keeping the spark alive and their connection strong. Unlike Matthew, Jeffrey also sought to continuously grow and evolve alongside his partner. They both invested in personal development individually, as well as together, attending seminars, workshops, and reading books on relationships and personal growth. This commitment to self-improvement created a nurturing atmosphere where both partners encouraged each other to be the best version of themselves. One aspect that set Jeffrey's wonderful relationship apart from Matthew's was the way conflicts were handled. Instead of resorting to blame and anger, Jeffrey and Alison approached any disagreements with a view to understanding, empathizing, and seeking mutually beneficial solutions. They practiced active listening in which they gave their partner the opportunity to express their feelings and concerns without interruption. Through this, they built a solid foundation of trust, respect, and healthy conflict resolution. Moreover, Jeffrey and Alison believed in the importance of maintaining their individual identities while being in a committed relationship. They both had their own hobbies, interests, and friendships outside the relationship, recognizing that a fulfilling life comes from a balance of togetherness and independence. In contrast, Matthew's relationship lacked many of these essential elements. He struggled with communication, often keeping his thoughts and feelings to himself, leading to misunderstandings or resentment within his relationship. His inability to be vulnerable created a barrier that prevented true intimacy and connection with his partner. The absence of regular expressions of love and appreciation left Matthew and his partner feeling unappreciated, and this lack of quality time spent together resulted in a loss of the spark that initially brought them together. Matthew's relationship also suffered due to his unwillingness to grow and evolve as an individual. He lacked the motivation to better himself or pursue personal development, resulting in a stagnant and increasingly unsatisfying relationship. His unhealthy approach to conflict resolution, where anger and blame took precedence over understanding and empathy, further eroded the bond with his partner. In summary, the difference between Jeffrey's wonderful relationship and Matthew's unsuccessful one can be attributed to several key factors. By embracing open communication, regular expressions of love and appreciation, quality time spent together, personal growth, healthy conflict resolution, and balancing individuality with togetherness, Jeffrey created a strong, fulfilling, and nurturing bond with Alison. In contrast, Matthew's lack of these essential ingredients led to the downfall of his relationship. For anyone seeking to establish and maintain a deeply connected and thriving partnership, following Jeffrey's example would be a wise and valuable approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

Why doesn't the Singapore government ban prospective employers from requesting your physical photo during a job interview? Why doesn't Singapore prohibit employers / job agencies from requesting candidates' photograph during job applications? Pick your answer from: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(b). yes Both questions essentially have the same meaning. They are asking about the policy or reasoning behind Singapore's government not banning employers or job agencies from requesting an applicant's photograph during the job application process. The questions are just phrased slightly differently, but the core subject and inquiry remain the same.  To answer the implied question about the policy, it's important to understand some context about job applications and photographs in Singapore: 1. Cultural norms: In some countries, including Singapore, photographs are often included in job applications. The culture surrounding job applications might consider photographs as standard information that is provided when applying for a job. Thus, not prohibiting employers from requesting photographs could be seen as a reflection of this cultural norm. 2. Presentation and appearance: Employers may want to see an applicant's physical appearance as part of their evaluation process to assess how the candidate presents themselves. This can provide additional insight into the applicant's professionalism, confidence, and suitability for a particular job. 3. Anti-discrimination laws: Singapore has anti-discrimination laws which prevent employers from discriminating against job applicants based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, gender, and age. These laws are in place to ensure that the job hiring process is fair and merit-based. However, the request for a photograph in the application process might still be seen as a potential avenue for bias or discrimination. 4. Privacy concerns: Including a photograph in a job application may lead to privacy issues, especially in today's digital age, where personal information is easily disseminated. However, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) has provisions that regulate the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data, which includes photographs when provided as part of job applications. Based on these factors, it is possible that the government of Singapore does not see it necessary to ban prospective employers from requesting photographs during job applications, provided that employers comply with existing laws. Nonetheless, the debate on the relevance and impact of requesting photographs in job applications continues in many countries, including Singapore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Back when I was obese, I ate too many snacks and ate too few vegetables, but my weight reacted best when the  Select from: + vegetables were bland.; + snacks were bland.;","output":"\\"Back when I was obese, I ate too many snacks and ate too few vegetables, but my weight reacted best when the snacks were bland.\\" This might seem peculiar but the reasoning behind it is quite logical. Snacks, especially processed ones, are extraordinarily high in added sugars and unhealthy fats, and can easily add a lot of unnecessary calories to your diet. When these snacks are flavored with attractive, alluring tastes, they become even more irresistible, prompting you to consume more of them. Bland snacks, on the other hand, do not possess the same addictive quality. When snacks are bland, they are much less enticing and do not incite the same irresistible cravings, making it easier to eat them in moderation or avoid them altogether. This is the reason why consuming snacks with little flavor seemed to have a significantly positive effect on the weight. Moreover, bland snacks often offer a secondary benefit. Without the added salts, sugars, flavor enhancers, and other artificial additives that deliver those addictive flavors, these bland snacks are generally more healthy. They are less likely to skyrocket your daily intake of sodium and sugar, which are two commonly over-consumed nutrients that have been linked to illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.  In contrast, whether vegetables are bland or not doesn't really have the same impact when it comes to weight loss. Vegetables, by default, are known for being low in harm-causing elements such as sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium, which are more typically found in processed foods such as snacks. Instead, vegetables are loaded with beneficial compounds, such as dietary fibers, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that can help you stay healthy, satiated, and less likely to overeat. Preparing vegetables by adding various spices and herbs, or even roasting them, can enhance their flavor without significantly increasing their calorie content. Therefore, eating flavorful vegetables could actually be beneficial for weight loss as these preparations might increase your enjoyment of these high-fiber, nutrient-dense foods, making it easier to stick with a wholesome, vegetable-rich diet. So in summary, it's reasonable to conclude that during my period of overcoming obesity, my weight became more receptive and started to drop when I started consuming bland snacks because it helped to control calorie intake and curb overindulgence. Therefore, my weight reacted best when the snacks were bland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Context: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Given the question: I already gave this example in another post but I think it was a really interesting situation with an interesting outcome so I’m going to repeat it. When I was 21 years old I produced a play. It was actually my second. The first was really successful. With the second I bit off a lot more than I could chew and I got too big for my britches and I ended up with a sprawling money eating disaster that caused me to have to move to a poor part of town and to go to court with my publicist and to be in debt for a couple of years. I could have absolutely let this ruin me and discourage me. And I realized this was a very delicate situation for my creativity and my sense of hope for the future. So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this. And the big Takeaway for me with this experience is that I have talent and there is a big creative future for me. And I have hope. I have to slow down. I have to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself. I definitely have to clean up this mess and be patient for however long it takes . But bottom line the big take away from this experience is that I have talent and I have a future and I have Hope.” It was one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever had with myself.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\". There is only one correct answer for each question. Q: Article: The U.S. Department of Labor statistics  show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree. On the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen. The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments  go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them. One result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up.   Question: It's implied but not stated in the passage that   _  .

Matthias Mueller has been named Volkswagen's new chief executive as the company deals with the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal. The scandal saw the German automaker admitting to falsifying emissions data in 11 million of its diesel vehicles worldwide to deceive regulators and customers. Step 1: Introduce the background of the former CEO The scandal resulted in the resignation of former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down on September 23, 2015. Winterkorn had led VW since 2007 and had overseen the company's rise to become the largest automobile manufacturer globally. Step 2: Discuss how Mueller was chosen for the role The Volkswagen supervisory board appointed Matthias Mueller as the new CEO on September 25, 2015. Mueller, a veteran who joined the VW group in 1977, has been credited for overseeing the successful launch of new models and increasing sales during his tenure as the CEO of Porsche AG, a Volkswagen subsidiary. Step 3: Outline the priorities and challenges Mueller will face In his new role, Mueller will have to address the tasks of restructuring the company and restoring trust in the Volkswagen brand. His first priority will be dealing with the legal, financial, and reputational consequences of the emissions scandal. This includes cooperating with investigations into the matter, addressing customer concerns and litigation, and implementing transparent corporate governance reforms. Step 4: Highlight the potential impact of the scandal on the auto industry The Volkswagen emissions scandal can potentially have ripple effects across the entire automotive industry. Regulators around the world are scrutinizing diesel vehicles more closely, leading other automakers to reassess their compliance with emissions standards. Industry experts believe that the increased scrutiny may result in stricter regulations in the future, requiring greater investments in efficient and clean technologies resulting in additional costs on vehicle manufacturers. Step 5: Conclude by commenting on Volkswagen's future prospects Despite the magnitude of the challenges facing Volkswagen, Mueller's long history within the company, his proven leadership skills, and his strategic vision can help navigate through turbulent times. The company has already announced an investment in electric vehicles and other sustainable technologies, which indicates a commitment to change. In conclusion, with Mueller at the helm, many hope that Volkswagen will successfully restore confidence in its brand, adapt to stricter regulations, and continue to innovate, leading the company into a new era of sustainability and growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.  and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Please answer this question : Who had a somatic mutation? Answer:","output":"Holly had a somatic mutation.

The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Jr., a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-Woo what is perceived (at first) to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip to shadow his young mistress, Heesoo (Shin Min-a), for fear that she may be cheating on him with another, much younger man, with the mandate that he must kill them both if he discovers their affair. As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.When he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her.

Combining both ingredients creates a non-toxic cleaning solution that quickly and effectively breaks down tough grease build-up. Adding the baking soda slowly, to cool water, will prevent it from fizzing up over the top of your pot. The hot water will help loosen the grease, allowing the cleaning solution to fully penetrate into the filter. Remove the water from the heat as soon as it starts to boil; too much agitation will create bubbles from the dish soap, which can spill over onto your stove. You can use this cleaning solution to remove grease from the exhaust hood and fan blades inside your unit. Extra solution can also be used to easily clean your stove-top and oven. Pour the solution slowly to prevent backsplash. Keep adding solution until the grease filter is completely submerged. Keep  any extra solution warm, in case an additional soak is needed for a filter with particularly serious grease  build-up.  You can soak the filter in the same pot you heated the solution, as long as it is not a non-stick pot. The metal filter will scratch non-stick coating. Most pots are not big enough to completely cover a typical grease filter, so you may need to do half of the filter at a time in order to get the entire filter clean. As the filter soaks, the baking soda and dish soap will slowly dissolve the grease. The dirtier the filter, the longer you should let it soak. If you have not cleaned your filter in years, you may need to let it soak for up to an hour. Use a non-abrasive sponge or soft bristled  brush to scrub away any remaining grease. The grease should come away easily. Avoid scrubbing aggressively to minimize the risk of damaging your filter. If some of the grease is stuck on the filter, repeat the soaking process with clean solution. Wash away as much grease and residue as possible. Grease will collect faster on areas of the filter that are still dirty. Starting with a perfectly clean filter will slow down future build-up. You do not want any moisture on your filter when you re-install it. Air-drying, instead of using a cloth or blow drying, will prevent the filter from being damaged. The filter should be completely dry after an hour or 2 of air-drying. The more you cook, the more often you should clean your grease filters. Regular cleaning will make your exhaust fan operate much more efficiently, and greatly decrease the health and safety risks that grease build-up presents. Summary:","output":"Baking soda and dish soap mixed together make a safe cleaning solution that helps get rid of grease. When you mix them with hot water, it can clean things like the filter in your kitchen hood. To clean your filter, you'll need to soak it in the solution and scrub it gently with a soft sponge or brush. It's important to let the filter dry completely before putting it back. Cleaning your filter often helps your kitchen fan work better and keeps your kitchen safer and healthier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"The two questions are inquiring about different information. My answer is: (A). no. To answer the first question, here are some examples of trade-off situations in our life: 1. Time management: Balancing work, family, and personal time often requires trade-offs, as we have limited time in a day.    Justification: We have to prioritize and make decisions based on our values and goals. 2. Spending vs saving: Choosing to spend money on immediate desires like a vacation or a luxurious item often means less money for future needs like retirement or emergencies.    Justification: We have to strike a balance between enjoying the present and securing the future. 3. Career advancement: Pursuing a promotion or higher salary might require longer working hours or relocation, potentially affecting personal relationships or work-life balance.    Justification: We have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of career advancement in relation to other important life aspects. 4. Education: Choosing a major in college may lead to different career paths, and some majors might offer more job opportunities or higher income but might not align with personal interests or passions.    Justification: We have to balance potential job opportunities and income with personal fulfillment and excitement. Regarding the second question, it is challenging to 'turn off' our humanity in real life as it is deeply rooted in our emotions, empathy, and complex relationships with others. Our humanity, as a combination of cognitive and emotional qualities, is an essential part of how we perceive, understand, and respond to the world around us. It is unrealistic to completely separate ourselves from these aspects as they are intertwined in the fabric of our existence. However, in certain situations where objective decision-making is necessary, people may attempt to control or suppress their emotional responses to make more rational choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices:  +They will surprise someone with the roses ..  +They will put the roses up for display ..  +They will sell the roses for profit ..  +They will gift the roses to another person .. Answer the following question: What may happen after they dye the roses ?","output":"After dyeing the originally dingy white roses using red food coloring, a few potential outcomes may occur, depending on the individual's intentions and interests. Below, each available choice is elaborated. 1. Surprising someone with the roses: In this scenario, the individual may choose to present the newly dyed roses as a thoughtful and creative surprise to a friend, family member, partner, or colleague. The recipient of this gift will likely appreciate the effort and thought put into refreshing the roses and turning them into a vibrant, lovely bouquet. Such a gesture may help to strengthen the bond between the giver and receiver, sparking joy and fostering a sense of gratitude. 2. Putting the roses up for display: If the individual opts to showcase the dyed roses, they can become a beautiful and eye-catching decorative element in any room. They might choose to place them in a vase on a tabletop, windowsill, or mantelpiece, creating an appealing focal point and conversation piece for visitors. Additionally, the roses would serve as a constant reminder of the individual's creativity and resourcefulness in repurposing flowers that were originally destined for the trash. 3. Selling the roses for profit: Should the person choose to capitalize on their resourcefulness, they may decide to sell the freshly dyed roses either online or at a physical location. If successful, it could potentially turn into a profitable and eco-friendly business venture. For example, they might offer to revitalize flowers that others would discard or provide a service for creating custom colored flower arrangements. In this case, the newly dyed roses could help the individual to identify a market niche and launch an entrepreneurial endeavor. 4. Gifting the roses to another person: Finally, the individual may choose to give away the dyed roses as a meaningful gift to someone else. This act of kindness might offer emotional benefits to both parties involved. The receiver will likely feel touched by the individual's creative efforts, while the giver can take pride in their ability to bring happiness to another person's life. This act of generosity might even inspire others to repurpose items they might have otherwise thrown away and foster a sense of community and thoughtfulness. In conclusion, after dyeing the roses with red food coloring, multiple possibilities could unfold, each of which can bring about positive results. Whether the individual chooses to surprise someone, display the roses, sell them for profit, or gift them to another person, their resourcefulness and creativity in repurposing the originally dingy white roses can lead to strengthened relationships, successful business opportunities, and increased feelings of community, happiness, and gratitude."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying \\"We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction that we're going in\\". Later, on March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for \\"Burn It Down\\". Joe Hahn directed the video. Shinoda spoke to Co.Create about the album's art, saying that it will \\"blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there's going to be that\\".  On April 15, 2012, Shinoda announced that Living Things would be the title of Linkin Park's fifth album. Shinoda stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums. The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. The band performed \\"Burn It Down\\" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards. On May 24, the band released the music video for \\"Burn It Down\\" and debuted \\"Lies Greed Misery\\", another song from Living Things, on BBC Radio 1. \\"Powerless\\", the twelfth and closing track of the album, was featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.  Living Things sold over 223,000 copies during its debut week, ranking No. 1 on the US Albums Charts. Linkin Park's single, \\"Castle of Glass\\", was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards. The band also performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to \\"Cities\\" by Beck. Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music festival in Australia, where they shared the stage with Metallica, Paramore, Slayer and Sum 41.  On August 10, 2013, the band collaborated with American musician Steve Aoki to record the song \\"A Light That Never Comes\\" for Linkin Park's online puzzle-action game LP Recharge (short for Linkin Park Recharge), which was launched on Facebook and the official LP Recharge website on September 12, 2013. On the day of the game's release, Linkin Park made a post on their Facebook explaining that the song used to promote the game would be included on a new remix album, entitled Recharged, which was released on October 29, 2013 on CD, vinyl, and digital download. Similar to Reanimation, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from Living Things, with contributions from other artists, such as Ryu of Styles of Beyond, Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money Mark, and Rick Rubin. The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film Mall, which was directed by Joe Hahn.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Symphony X is an American progressive metal band from Middletown, New Jersey. Founded in 1994, the band consists of guitarist Michael Romeo, keyboardist Michael Pinnella, drummer Jason Rullo, lead vocalist Russell Allen and bassist Michael Lepond. They achieved some commercial success with the 2007 album Paradise Lost and the 2011 album Iconoclast, which reached number 76 on the Billboard 200. Romeo explained the band's name in a 2008 interview; \\"So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word 'Symphony' came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? The band is working on releasing a second fan club CD. Michael Romeo said it will be another collection of demo tunes and other rare material, and may also include a bit of content created just for the release, along the lines of MJR's Star Wars tune on the first fan club CD, Rarities and Demos, which has since sold out of its first pressing. SXW, the band's revamped fan club, has relaunched and is now active.  The band began recording the drum tracks for the new album on September 9, 2014, and planned to release the complete recording by the spring of 2015. Michael Lepond stated they had ten songs written and that the album would contain either nine or all ten of them. He also stated all lyrics and instrumental tracks were composed and ready to be brought together, and that the album would be less heavy than Iconoclast: \\"If I had to compare, I would say that it's a combination of The Odyssey and Paradise Lost -- something in there. It has a lot of classic Symphony X elements in it, which I think a lot of our fans were missing for a few years. So I think our fans will really like this one. It really just focuses on solid songwriting.\\"  As of December 11, 2014, recording of the drums, lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and bass were complete. With the keyboards, guitar solos, background vocals, and some miscellaneous odds and ends being done in the coming weeks. On April 10, 2015 the band announced the mixing and mastering of the new album was complete. On May 18, 2015, the band announced the title of the album would be titled Underworld, and a release date of July 24, 2015. The first single from the album, \\"Nevermore\\", premiered on May 22, 2015. The band released the second single, \\"Without You\\", on June 19, 2015, and was made available for digital download.  According to singer Russell Allen, the band entered a short hiatus during 2017 in which they did not perform, due in part to his commitment to Adrenaline Mob, although it was announced during a January 2018 interview with Metal Nation that the band had plans to get together in the following months and begin writing a follow up to Underworld. On July 14, 2017, Adrenaline Mob was involved in a serious vehicular accident, which resulted in severe injuries for Allen and two deaths. When was the album released?","output":"The album titled \\"Underworld\\" by the band Symphony X was released on July 24, 2015. This album was a much-anticipated release by the fans, as it reflected the classic Symphony X elements that many fans had missed in their recent works. The album was a combination of elements from their previous works, “The Odyssey” and “Paradise Lost,” according to Michael Lepond, the band’s bassist. Before the full release of the album, two singles were made available. The first single titled \\"Nevermore\\" premiered on May 22, 2015. This was followed by the second single, \\"Without You\\", which was released on June 19, 2015, and was made available for digital download.  The album's preparation phase was a well-planned and executed one. The band started recording the drum tracks for \\"Underworld\\" on September 9, 2014. The complete recording was planned to be released by the spring of 2015, and it was stated that the album would contain either nine or all ten of the songs written. The recording of the drums, lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and bass were complete as of December 11, 2014, with the remaining work on keyboards, guitar solos, background vocals and miscellaneous elements planned to be finished in the coming weeks. The mixing and mastering of the new album was announced complete on April 10, 2015.  In retrospect, “Underworld” serves as a testament to Symphony X’s dedication to their music, showcasing their ability to incorporate classical elements into their distinctive progressive metal sound. After releasing this album, however, the band did take a short hiatus in 2017 due to various commitments and events, but they planned to reconvene and start writing a follow-up to \\"Underworld\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The shock of discovering an affair brings with it a range of emotions, from anger and jealousy to shame and embarrassment. When emotions are rampant, it's difficult to think clearly. Look for outside help—someone to talk to who can help you to begin to heal.  Feelings that are overwhelming begin to diminish if you’re able to speak about them to someone who cares and who knows how to listen. A therapist can offer an objective perspective and a calming environment for talking out your problems.  A therapist has education and experience to help them guide you through the first days that follow the discovery of an affair. Speak to family or friends, too. Choose listeners who will remain calm and listen and not feed the flames of emotion you’re already struggling to handle. While it’s generally accepted that affairs are symptomatic of problems in a relationship, there may be multiple reasons why your partner had an affair.  One of the major reasons for infidelity is opportunity. Sometimes an affair isn’t planned. People sometimes “stumble” into affairs, rather than plan them. Many people engage in affairs because they want to see if they’re desirable outside of the relationship. Affairs could also be a symptom of another problem, like alcohol abuse or sex addiction. It might be tempting,  because laying the blame on yourself makes the problem easier to control; theoretically, you could change your behavior and you prevent another affair. However, the problem, at the very least, is the responsibility of both partners. Blaming yourself might offer temporary hope, but it won't resolve the problem.  Don’t absolve your partner of accountability for the affair by thinking that you should love your partner unconditionally, or put their happiness before your own. Resist diminishing the affair as a “little mistake.”Don't chide yourself for overreacting. It’s true that the affair was probably a symptom of problems in your relationship.  And it might be true that you contributed to the problems that led to the affair.  But it’s also true that your partner had other options—other ways to express dissatisfaction or disappointments.  Your partner chose to have an affair.  You didn’t make that choice for your partner. Most couples want to stay together after an affair. About 70 percent of couples try to rebuild their relationships.   Assess your relationship. The likelihood of being able to forgive and move forward increases if you both feel the relationship is worth saving.  Identify the qualities in your partner that led to the affair so that you can understand how likely it is that another affair is on the horizon. Personality traits such as self-centeredness, dishonesty and a feeling of entitlement suggest that, for some people, it’s not possible to remain faithful.If you’re hoping to fix a relationship that will constantly need fixing it might be time to move on. Assess your partner’s willingness to be accountable for their actions.  Are they sorry about the actions? Or are they sorry about getting caught? Does your partner shows signs, such as guilt, that signal they’re aware their actions were wrong?  Think about the positives, too.  What were the strengths of your relationship?  What initially brought you together? It's difficult to focus on the positives after your partner has cheated, but try to be objective.

Brett wanted Nick to plant a tree in their yard but","output":"Brett wanted Nick to plant a tree in their yard, but their initial disagreement transformed into a lesson in communication, compromise, and environmental stewardship. At first, Nick was hesitant to plant a tree, as he believed their yard was not spacious enough and he was concerned about the maintenance it would require. Brett, on the other hand, was adamant about the benefits that planting a tree would bring to their property and the environment. The two of them set about addressing their concerns and researching the different aspects of tree planting. They started by discussing the various advantages of having a tree in their yard. Brett emphasized the aesthetic value that a tree offers and explained that trees can provide natural shade and act as a privacy screen. Moreover, she drew attention to the benefits of trees in reducing air pollution, absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and supporting wildlife habitats. Nick gradually began to appreciate the importance of planting a tree and how it could improve their quality of life. To allay Nick's concerns about space, they both spent time researching trees that would be suitable for their yard size and soil quality. They decided to look for a small or medium-sized tree that could fit comfortably within their property boundary without causing any potential issues later on. They also took into consideration the growth rate and maintenance requirements of the tree species they were considering. After some research, they agreed on planting a flowering dogwood tree. This type of tree remains relatively small in size, has an attractive appearance, and is low-maintenance. The compromise they reached was a responsible decision for both their yard and the environment, as the flowering dogwood tree is native to their region and does not consume too much water. Nick and Brett learned an essential lesson about the importance of communication and compromise in achieving a common goal. They acknowledged each other's concerns, sought a solution by researching and gathering information, and eventually agreed on planting a tree that met both their expectations. Additionally, they also became more environmentally conscious throughout the process and realized the significance of playing their part in addressing climate change and promoting biodiversity. In the end, Brett's initial desire to plant a tree, coupled with Nick's willingness to compromise and learn about different tree species, allowed them to find a satisfactory solution and strengthen their relationship. The planted flowering dogwood tree would serve as a symbol of their cooperation, environmental responsibility, and growth as individuals and as a couple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: obligatory disclaimer, this didn't happen today, it happened years ago in high school. my boyfriends brother bought a large amount of a popular brand of water flavouring concentrate, and my boyfriend wanted to try it. it says right on the package that you shouldn't drink it right from the bottle and that it should be diluted, but, of course my boyfriend put a few drips right into his mouth. he said it was good, so naturally i tried a drip or two myself. it is so concentrated and extremely sour that i immediately started salivating so much that my mouth fills. the sensation wore off, and we forgot about it. a few hours later, he left his room to the kitchen and returned with water flavoured with the concentrate. he also brought the bottle itself back with him. we started getting into it, and he got the bright idea that he will put it on his penis and i was supposed to lick it off. i remembered what it had done to my mouth earlier, but before i could protest, he was already dripping it on. immediately he started screaming because it was burning so badly, so to relieve the pain i tried to lick it off. my mouth started salivating, even more than the first time, and it was dripping everywhere. and this isn't just any old day to day salivating, this is like right before you're about to vomit, or if you eat one of those extremely sour candies. the amount of concentrate that entered my mouth made me salivate enough to probably fill a pool. this concentrate also has dye in it, which happens to stain skin and everything else very strongly. the dye mixed with my saliva and it allowed the volume of this dye to increase tenfold. i absolutely could not contain all this saliva in my mouth, so his hands, entire abdomen, and pelvic area were stained red and so were my mouth, chin, neck, and hands. it was horribly embarrassing when his parents asked me why my face was covered in red dye, and i said i spilled the water with the concentrate in it, but i think they knew something was up.  please tell me we weren't the only idiots that did this. this is a cautionary tale, don't put concentrate on your penis. or your vagina. or on anything.  edit: wording","output":"TIFU by letting my boyfriend put concentrated flavoring on his penis"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose ripe and juicy oranges: The first step in obtaining juice from an orange is selecting the right fruit. Look for oranges that are heavy for their size and have slightly soft, smooth, and glossy skin. Avoid those with wrinkles, blemishes, or overly rough skin, as these may be indicators of poor quality or lack of juice content. 2. Wash the oranges: Rinse the oranges thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt, pesticides, or bacteria that may be present on their surface. 3. Soften the fruit: Before juicing, roll the oranges on a flat surface while applying light pressure with the palm of your hand. This will help in breaking the membranes around the juice vesicles, making it easier to extract the juice. 4. Cut the oranges: Place the orange on its side on a cutting board, and, using a sharp knife, carefully slice the fruit in half through its equator. Ensure that you are cutting across the sections and not through the stem end. There are various methods to extract the juice from the halved oranges: A. Hand squeeze method: 1. Hold one half of the sliced orange in your hand, cut-side facing up. 2. Squeeze the orange firmly, allowing the juice to drip into a container or glass. 3. To extract as much juice as possible, twist and press the orange at the same time. 4. Some people use a fork or a spoon to press down on the orange, helping to release more juice. 5. Repeat with the other half. B. Citrus juicer method: 1. Purchase a citrus juicer if you don't have one already. These come in a variety of styles: manual, electric, or even attachment pieces for a blender or food processor. 2. Place the halved orange on the juicer cone, cut-side down. 3. For manual juicers, press down on the orange while twisting it back and forth. For an electric citrus juicer, push down on the orange, and the motorized cone will automatically rotate to extract the juice. 4. The juice will flow through a strainer to remove any seeds and pulp, and straight into a container or glass. 5. Repeat with the other half. C. Using a lemon squeezer or citrus press: 1. Place the halved orange, cut-side facing down, into the lemon squeezer or citrus press. 2. Firmly press the handles together to crush the orange, releasing its juice. 3. The juice will flow through the holes or strainer into a container or glass. 4. Repeat with the other half. 5. Remove seeds and pulp: Some people prefer a clear juice without any pulp. If that is the case, strain the juice using a fine-mesh strainer or sieve to remove any seeds or pulp remnants from the juice. 6. Serve immediately or refrigerate: Freshly squeezed orange juice can be enjoyed immediately or stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to two days. The flavor and nutritional content will be best when consumed the same day. That's how you can obtain juice from an orange using different methods. No matter which method you choose, freshly squeezed orange juice is a delicious and nutritious addition to any breakfast or snack time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He picks up an acid solution that he labels as solution A. To compare it with another solution he chooses a solution that is not an acid. He labels it as solution B.  Which solution has higher pH value, soution A or solution B? A:","output":"Solution B will have a higher pH value than solution A. Let's understand why by discussing the properties of acids, bases, and the pH scale. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale that ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 represents a neutral solution. The scale is used to quantify the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. A solution with a pH level below 7 is considered an acid, while a solution with a pH level above 7 is considered a base (alkaline).  Acids are substances that dissolve in water and release hydrogen ions (H+) into the solution. These hydrogen ions contribute to the acidic nature of the solution. Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3). Acids usually have sour taste, can change the color of certain pH indicators (such as litmus paper), and can also conduct electricity due to the presence of ions. On the other hand, bases (also known as alkalis) are substances that dissolve in water and release hydroxide ions (OH-) into the solution. These hydroxide ions contribute to the alkaline nature of the solution. Some common examples of bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Bases, contrary to acids, have a bitter taste, feel slippery when touched, can also change the color of pH indicators, and can conduct electricity. Now, let's go back to Mike's solutions. Solution A is an acid solution, which means its pH value will be below 7. In contrast, Solution B is not an acid (and thus might be a base or neutral solution), implying that its pH value will be at least 7 or higher. Therefore, comparing the two solutions, we can conclude that Solution B has a higher pH value compared to Solution A."},{"instruction":"Addison walked home from work after realizing she had a flat tire.

Summarize this article: When using PowerPoint slides you want them to actually help and raise the quality of your presentation, not simply exist alongside it. The best way to do this is to ensure that your slides do not simply restate what you are saying. You should not be reading from your slides. Really, you want PowerPoint presentations to contain as little text as possible. Having to read text will distract your audience, even if only unconsciously, from what you are telling them. With this in mind, keep your text to a minimum and present it in a way that is easy to read, such as a bulleted list. So, if you can't put all your information onto your slides, how are you supposed to tell your audience everything that can't fit into your speech? Handouts! Make a one or two page handout, for each audience member or for people to take at will, which contains a section for each slide or portion of your presentation. Here you can put extra information or key points of information that were included in your presentation. Graphics are what make a really engaging PowerPoint presentation. These can provide your audience with a new way of looking at what you are trying to tell them. They can provide information which may be difficult for you to convey in words, such as charts and graphs. You will want to be sure, however, that they actually add to your presentation and do not simply provide a distraction. With the above information in mind, you will want to be absolutely sure that you do not include unnecessary visuals or audio. Examples would include transition animations, clip art, sound effects, and cluttered templates or background images. These are the features which tend to make Powerpoint presentations boring, dated, and unhelpful. They distract audience members and add nothing to the presentation. They even hinder the audience's ability to absorb information. Summary:","output":"Create effective PowerPoint presentations by limiting text, avoiding reading from slides, and focusing on clear visuals, such as charts and graphs. Use handouts to share additional information or key points. Ensure any visuals or audio elements contribute to the presentation without distracting or hindering the audience's understanding."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What is funny? The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances   are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa  . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: \\"I'm sorry. I should have known better\\" or \\"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny...

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

The campaign received support from celebrities on Twitter who backed the show to be renewed, including Channing Tatum, William Shatner and Snooki as well as stars from cult television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Sarah Michelle Gellar and Charmed's Shannen Doherty and Holly Marie Combs. As of June 2017 and after 3 years since the finale, the petition has received more than 272,000 signatures. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: will there be a season 3 of witches of east end?  (I) no. (II) yes.","output":"(I) no. Based on the information provided in the text, Lifetime had cancelled Witches of East End in 2014 due to declining ratings. Although fans launched an online petition campaign called \\"Renew Witches of East End\\" with support from various celebrities, there is no mention of the show's renewal or any subsequent season. As of June 2017, the petition had received more than 272,000 signatures, but no information about the show being picked up by another network or streaming service like Netflix is mentioned. Therefore, the best answer is that there will not be a season 3 of Witches of East End. (II) yes is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the show has been successfully renewed or picked up by another service. The petition campaign and celebrity support do not guarantee the show's return."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\"?","output":"The given premise is \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic.\\" To analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious,\\" we must first break down the meaning and components of each statement and identify any logical connections between them. Premise: \\"I hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has a desire to avoid participating in any actions, decisions, or events that could be considered drastic. The term \\"drastic\\" typically implies a significant, possibly extreme, change from the norm or a highly consequential decision. It may involve risks or have far-reaching implications that could negatively impact the speaker or others involved. The speaker's desire to avoid such circumstances indicates their preference for less dramatic, more predictable situations. Hypothesis: \\"I hope I never do anything that serious\\" In this statement, the speaker expresses a similar desire, but this time they are referring to the level of seriousness rather than the degree of drastic change. The term \\"serious\\" can denote various contexts, such as the importance, gravity, or weight of a situation. A serious action, event, or decision bears significant consequences and may entail considerable responsibility. The use of the term \\"serious\\" in this context also conveys a sense of caution and mindfulness regarding the potential impacts of such actions. Now let's examine any logical connections between the premise and the hypothesis. Both statements share a common theme: the speaker's desire to avoid engaging in situations that carry high stakes, significant consequences, or substantial responsibility. In both instances, the focus is on not taking part in events or actions that may lead to undesirable outcomes. The premise and hypothesis are closely related in that they convey the speaker's preference for less consequential situations. In fact, one might argue that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise's focus on avoiding \\"drastic\\" situations implicitly suggests that the speaker also wishes to avoid \\"serious\\" situations since drastic actions or events are often serious in nature, bearing significant consequences or requiring a high level of responsibility. However, it is important to note that the terms \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" are not synonymous. Drastic events are more about the magnitude of change and the extent of deviation from the norm, while seriousness pertains to the importance or gravity of a situation. It is possible to have a drastic change that may not be serious, as well as a serious situation that is not drastic. That being said, given the overlap in the implications and consequences of both drastic and serious situations, we can reasonably infer that if the speaker hopes to never venture into something that drastic, it is likely that they also hope to never do anything that serious. In conclusion, the premise \\"I hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" does provide support for the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious\\" due to the shared themes of aversion to high-stakes situations and the desire to avoid undesirable consequences. While the terms \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" are not interchangeable, their close relationship in terms of potential impact and significance makes it plausible that the speaker's desire to avoid one would extend to the other."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Possible answers: throw the ball away, find the ball, walk away from the ball Answer:","output":"Before Sydney takes any of the actions mentioned, there is a crucial step that Sydney needs to address. First and foremost, Sydney needs to evaluate the situation and identify the potential threat to the ball. Are there any suspicious individuals or potential thieves around? Is the ball in a vulnerable location where it can easily be taken? How much does the ball mean to Sydney, and would the loss of the ball cause any significant distress?  Once Sydney has a clearer understanding of the potential risks, they can decide which course of action is most appropriate. Each possible solution mentioned has its merits and may be suited to different scenarios: 1. Throw the ball away: If Sydney feels that the ball is no longer valuable or worth protecting, discarding the ball may be the most suitable option. By doing so, Sydney eliminates the worry that someone might take the ball and can move on from the situation with peace of mind. However, this option may not be ideal if the ball holds any sentimental value or is essential for future use. 2. Find the ball: If Sydney has misplaced the ball or is uncertain of its whereabouts, their priority should be locating it. Sydney will need to retrace their steps and search for the ball in any areas where it may have been left behind. Once the ball is found, Sydney can then decide how best to protect it and prevent it from being stolen. 3. Walk away from the ball: This option suggests that Sydney prefers to distance themselves from the situation altogether. Walking away from the ball may be the best option if Sydney feels overwhelmed by the potential threat or wishes to prioritize their safety over the protection of the ball. However, walking away also means accepting the possibility that the ball may be taken. Sydney will need to weigh the value of the ball against their personal well-being and decide if this course of action aligns with their priorities. In conclusion, before Sydney can commit to any particular solution, they must first assess the details of their situation, identify the potential risks to their ball, and weigh the pros and cons of each available option. By doing so, Sydney will be better equipped to make a well-informed decision that best addresses their concerns and protects the ball, if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With only a few days until his execution, his lawyer negotiates a half million-dollar fee to tell his story to Bitsey Bloom, a journalist from a major news magazine. She is known for her ability to keep secrets and protect her sources. He tells her the story of how he ended up on death row, revealed to the audience through a series of lengthy flashbacks. Gale is head of the philosophy department at the University of Texas and an active member of DeathWatch, an advocacy group campaigning against capital punishment. At a graduation party, he encounters Berlin, an attractive graduate student who had been expelled from the school. while Gale is drunk at a party, she seduces him and gets him to have rough sex with her. She then falsely accuses Gale of rape. The next day, he loses a televised debate with the Governor of Texas when he is unable to point to an example of a demonstrably innocent man being executed during that governor's term. After losing the debate, Gale is arrested and charged with rape. While the rape charge against Gale is later dropped, the damage had already been done, and his family, marriage, university career and reputation are all destroyed. Constance Harraway, a fellow DeathWatch activist, is a close friend of Gale who consoles him after his life falls apart, and the pair have sex. However, the next day, Harraway is discovered raped and murdered, suffocated by a plastic bag taped over her head.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"?  Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.   While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

This equation is to be solved for the variable 'r'. To solve this equation for r, you have to find the value of 'r' that makes both sides of the equation equal.  The first step in solving the equation involves simplifying the equation by combining like terms. The right side of the equation has -88*r and +63*r as similar terms because they both contain the variable 'r'. Therefore, we can combine these like terms (-88*r + 63*r) by adding them together. The operation of addition is valid according to the properties of real numbers. Remember, when you add a negative term and a positive term, it's like subtracting the smaller from the larger, and the result takes the sign of the larger. -88*r + 63*r = (-88 + 63)*r = -25*r Substituting -25*r back into the equation, it becomes: 50 = -25*r The next step is to isolate the variable 'r'. We do this by performing the inverse operation on both sides of the equation. In this case, since -25*r implies multiplication, we perform division on both sides. r=50/(-25) Finally, solve the right side of the equation by performing the division operation. The division of positive 50 by negative 25 yields 'r' as -2: r= -2 Therefore, the solution to the equation 50 = -88*r + 63*r for 'r' is r = -2. That is, if r equals -2, both sides of the equation will be equal, and hence, the equation will hold true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Rules of Survival (2006), is a novel by Nancy Werlin.

The banner said in huge letters: WELCOME HOME, ROGER! We drove on for a mile or two. Somebody said, \\" wonder who Roger is ?\\" We turned around, went back and knocked on the door.           Roger was a soldier on his way home from the Vietnam War. His family knew he was coming, but weren't sure what day he was going to arrive. We asked if they 'd mind if we brought the camera into the house. Roger's mother said it would be all right if we could give her a few minutes to fix her hair. We weren't there more than an hour, talking to those people who were all excited about Roger coming home.           That afternooon I wrote a simple story letting Roger represent all the soldiers coming home from war. We sent the film with the story to New York, and the anchorman put it on the Evening News.           Rarely has any of our stories caused such a reaction from viewers. There were dozens of calls from people moved by it, and hundreds of letters came in, some of them suggesting that the story be repeated.

That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick your answer from: 1). triglyceride 2). cortisol 3). melatonin 4). amylase Q: Digestive enzymes, including which enzyme, start breaking down starches into sugars?   A: Answer:","output":"Amylase is the digestive enzyme that starts breaking down starches into sugars. Amylase is primarily produced in the salivary glands and the pancreas. It plays a crucial role in the process of digestion, as it helps in the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler and more easily absorbable sugars. Starches, which are a form of complex carbohydrate, are long chains of glucose molecules that are present in various foods, primarily in grains and vegetables. As soon as we begin chewing food, the salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains amylase. This enzyme starts to break down the starches into simpler sugars like maltose and dextrin. This process continues in the small intestine, where pancreatic amylase is secreted and further breaks down the starches into simpler sugars and eventually into glucose molecules. Amylase is essential for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients, as the body can only absorb and utilize simple sugars – such as glucose – for energy production and other metabolic processes. Consequently, this enzyme plays a vital role in converting the carbohydrates from our diet into usable energy, thus supporting general health and well-being. While the other options - triglyceride, cortisol, and melatonin - are essential biological molecules, they don't perform the function of breaking down starches into sugars. Triglyceride is a type of lipid that serves as a significant energy storage molecule, cortisol is a hormone involved in stress response and glucose metabolism, and melatonin is a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

Answer:","output":"Jean-Claude Mukanya, born on May 1, 1968, in Switzerland, was a professional footballer who was best known for being a solid and reliable defender during his playing years. Mukanya's career spanned over a decade, showcasing skill, dedication, and determination. He was able to represent his national team, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which became an essential part of his identity as a player. Mukanya began his professional football journey in 1989 with the Belgian club KFC Lommel. During his time at Lommel, he managed to make an impressive 100 appearances, netting 10 goals for the club - a respectable number for a defender. His skill and presence on the field were quickly recognized, which led to his next tenure at the Dutch club NAC Breda from 1996 to 1996. Although Mukanya only managed to make nine appearances for the club, he still contributed significantly to the team's success during his short stint in the Netherlands. In 1996, Mukanya's career took him to another Belgian club, Eendracht Aalst, where he played until 1999. He displayed a remarkable level of consistency, making 47 appearances and scoring three goals. His tenure at Aalst further solidified his reputation as a strong and reliable defender. Mukanya's final stop as a professional footballer was with the Israeli club Hapoel Be'er Sheva from 1999-2001. He played two seasons with the club, showcasing his exceptional ability as a defender and rounding out a decade-long career. Standing at 1.87 meters tall, Mukanya's height was undoubtedly an advantage on the field, allowing him to dominate aerial duels and maintain a commanding presence at the back. His skill and physical attributes caught the attention of the DR Congo national team, and his international career began in 1991. He represented his country with pride and dedication until 1999, earning multiple international caps during his 8-year stint. Jean-Claude Mukanya's life story is a testament to the commitment and passion that one must have to succeed in the world of professional football. From his humble beginnings in Switzerland to representing DR Congo on the international stage, Mukanya forged a successful career and left an indelible mark on the clubs and teammates he played alongside.

How to protect accounts shared with a child when going through divorce  Get copies of account records.  Before you can accurately classify the account, you'll need basic information about how the account was initially set up. You also need balance statements and records of the account's transaction history. Answer:","output":"b. If the child or of your choice won't be using the account, you'll need copies of the transaction statement, as well as the checks or money coming in through the account. You also may need more personal information and more pending documentation. In a divorce, ensuring the financial security of a child is of utmost importance, and protecting shared accounts is a crucial step in achieving this. When a child will no longer be using a shared account, it is necessary to gather all the relevant documentation to monitor and manage the account effectively. This includes obtaining copies of transaction statements and records of any checks or money deposited into or withdrawn from the account. Additionally, gathering more personal information about the account holders and any pending documentation is vital. This personal information may pertain to the identities of the individuals on the account, their relationship to the child, and any legal agreements associated with the shared account. Collecting pending documentation can help you understand any ongoing transactions or financial obligations tied to the account. This information will aid in creating a clear picture of the account's financial status, enabling you to make informed decisions about its future during the divorce proceedings. Furthermore, completing a financial disclosure statement is a necessary part of any divorce, requiring you to list all accounts associated with either spouse. This statement will provide an overview of your current financial situation, allowing both you and the court to allocate resources fairly and ensure the best possible outcome for your child. By obtaining copies of account records and acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the account's activity, you can make well-informed decisions, prioritizing your child's financial security and well-being during and after the divorce process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Kendall, feeling a deep emotional connection to Jesse, will most likely want to continue sharing this vulnerable moment with him. Having brought Jesse's hands up to touch the scar on her face, she is showing a level of trust and openness that is significant in their relationship. Kendall may recount the story behind her scar, describing the events that led to it and the impact it had on her life. By doing this, she is inviting Jesse to not only physically touch her scar but also to empathize with the emotional pain and experiences associated with it. As they continue to sit in this moment together, Kendall may want to explore Jesse's own experiences, scars, or emotional baggage. This would involve encouraging him to share his own vulnerabilities and to reveal parts of himself that he may have otherwise kept hidden. Kendall may gently ask probing questions to guide him through this process or simply offer a listening ear and supportive presence, making it clear that she is truly interested in understanding his story as well. Depending on the context and level of intimacy between Kendall and Jesse, this moment could potentially be a catalyst for a heart-to-heart conversation in which both parties reveal more about their past experiences, emotional traumas, and personal growth. Such a conversation could strengthen the bond between Kendall and Jesse and provide them with an increased appreciation for one another's resilience and character. In the end, Kendall may want to offer reassurance and comfort, acknowledging the bravery displayed by both of them for sharing their vulnerabilities. She might express gratitude for their relationship and the trust they have built, giving them a sense of safety as they lean on each other for support and understanding. By allowing Jesse to touch her scar and sharing her story, Kendall has created a space for true emotional intimacy and connection, which she will likely want to continue nurturing as they move forward together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Iraq is boiling in unprecedented heat. Here’s how locals are trying to cope. BAGHDAD — I spent several days reporting on a record heatwave in Iraq. Baghdad, the capital, has boiled in temperatures at 109 degrees or higher almost every day since June 19. The mercury in the southern city of Basra reached an incredible 129 degrees on July 22. It’s not just Iraq, either. Countries across the Middle East and North Africa have sizzled this summer in extreme weather that has sounded alarms among climate experts. Global warming, they say, has already taken a harsh toll on these areas, and it will only get worse. So I decided to use Instagram to document what life in such blistering heat is like for people in Baghdad. Below are some pictures of what I witnessed: Abdel-Amir Hamoud owns a massive nursery in Baghdad where he sells everything from palm trees to roses. This summer has been so hot, he said, that more than 150,000 of his plants have dried out and died. Climate experts predict that warmer temperatures will have a devastating impact on farming in the region. Jassam Farhan, 69, lives with his family in a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Baghdad. Earlier this month, he passed out from the extreme heat and had to be taken to the hospital. His son contracted typhoid from the camp’s communal — and dirty — water source late last month. And every 20 minutes or so, just to keep cool, his grandchildren bathe in a metal pan filled with that same dirty water. There’s no air conditioning because of constant power cuts. Tens of thousands of other Iraqis are displaced and must also brave the elements. This is a picture of the communal water source at the camp where the Farhan family resides. When I took this picture, the temperature had soared beyond 110 degrees. Friday is the start of the weekend in Iraq, but this picture taken on a recent Friday shows just how unusually empty Baghdad’s streets have become because of the heat. If you step outside in temperatures that reach 120 degrees and higher — as many Iraqis have been forced to do this summer — it can literally feel like your face is burning. Power cuts that last 12 hours or longer in Iraq mean that homes can become uncomfortably warm during this particularly hot summer. And for kids, that’s just awful, especially since there is already a lack of air-conditioned recreational facilities here. So many boys improvise by cooling off in the Tigris River, where they fish and play games. Here’s a video of them swimming across this large body of water, which wends its way through Baghdad. One of the many kids taking a dip in the Tigris River on a recent Friday. Summary:","output":"Iraq is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave, with temperatures in Baghdad reaching 109 degrees almost every day since June 19 and 129 degrees in Basra on July 22. Countries across the Middle East and North Africa are also facing extreme heat, causing climate experts to raise concerns about the toll of global warming on these regions. Locals attempt to cope with the heat by seeking alternative cooling methods, as power cuts disrupt air conditioning. The intense heat has caused many plants to die, and is predicted to have devastating effects on farming in the region. Displaced Iraqis in camps face additional challenges from the heat, such as dirty communal water sources and health issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

This movie's origins are a mystery to me, as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I assume that before \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"Killshot\\" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. The new title of \\"Kill Shot\\" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. The quick cuts, cheesy \\"Melrose Place\\" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for. And I don't mind at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). After looking it up on IMDB, my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R-rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections, that is. In any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section. All in all, it's entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a TV pilot, though. That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual. Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (who's gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating), token Asian (Japanese, I assume from the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done ok. But as a movie it just cracks me. I gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask of rentals.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Will Rodman, a scientist at the San Francisco biotech company Gen-Sys, is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-112 is given to a chimp named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. However, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is killed. Will's boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and orders the chimps euthanized. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin discovers that Bright Eyes had recently given birth to an infant chimp. Will agrees to take in the chimp, who is named Caesar. Will learns that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence and decides to raise him. Three years later, Will introduces Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument. Meanwhile, Will treats his dementia-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability.When Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash like his own, he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will. Meanwhile, Charles's condition returns as his Alzheimer's becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures a neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles. As a result, he is placed in a primate shelter where he is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard, Dodge Landon. Caesar learns how to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of a gorilla named Buck, he confronts the sanctuary's alpha chimp named Rocket and claims that position. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears development of a more powerful, gaseous version of the drug â ALZ-113 â when Will tells him it can not only heal brain diseases but also improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home to try to save his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Attempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses to go home with him. Instead, he escapes from the facility and returns to Will's house, where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar shocks him by speaking for the first time, yelling \\"No!\\" Caesar then electrocutes the cattle prod-wielding Dodge by spraying him with water, unintentionally killing him. The apes flee the facility, release the remaining chimps from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the San Francisco Zoo.A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping onto the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the bridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. Jacobs is then killed by Koba. As the apes find their way into the forest, Will arrives and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says that, \\"Caesar is home.\\" Will, realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye, respects Caesar's wishes. In a mid-credits scene, an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to Paris.

Please answer the following question: M: The same to you.  What was said before this conversation? A:","output":"Without the full context of the conversation, it's difficult to know exactly what was said before \\"The same to you.\\" However, based on this response, we can make an educated guess about the tone and subject matter leading up to it. It's important to note that \\"The same to you\\" is generally used as a response to someone's well-wishing, congratulation, or expression of goodwill. Based on this, we can infer that the conversation prior to this statement likely involved one person offering a similar sentiment towards the other. Let me provide a few potential scenarios that might have led to the response \\"The same to you.\\" Scenario 1: Person A: \\"Hey, just wanted to wish you a happy birthday!\\" Person B: \\"Thank you! The same to you.\\" (Assuming person B refers to an upcoming or recent birthday of person A) Scenario 2: Person A: \\"Congratulations on your new job! I hope it goes well.\\" Person B: \\"Thanks!

Add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television. One doesn't expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad. Plot-wise, it's a dreadful, clichéd romance of a type even Harlequin would consider beneath them. It's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes. Surprise, the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

We have the math problem: -7*u - 23 = -4*u - 4*u First, let's combine the two terms with 'u' on the right side of the equation: -4*u - 4*u can be combined into -8*u (because -4 and -4 added together make -8). So, now our equation looks like this: -7*u - 23 = -8*u Now, we want to get all the 'u' terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. We can do this by adding 8*u to both sides of the equation. This will get rid of u from the right side: -7*u + 8*u - 23 = 0 Now, let's simplify it. -7*u + 8*u equals 1*u (or just 'u', because when we add -7 to 8, we get 1): u - 23 = 0 The next step is to get 'u' all by itself. To do that, we can add 23 to both sides of the equation: u - 23 + 23 = 0 + 23 Now, the -23 and +23 cancel each other out on the left side, leaving us with: u = 23 So, the solution for 'u' is 23!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Flimsy, lightweight fabrics may seem breezy and casual, but they can cling to your body and actually become a bit uncomfortable. Fabrics that are a bit more substantial will make you look svelte and smooth. They offer support while also concealing any lines from undergarments. You don’t need to write off fabrics like silk and cotton forever, but be sure to try different fabrics to find what feels best to you. As a heavily obese girl, it may be tempting to stay in a certain fashion comfort zone. There is nothing wrong with embracing a flowy, boho style, but try on other options too. The next time you go out clothes shopping, take something you wouldn't normally wear into the fitting room with you. You may like something you never expected to!  You don’t need to buy any of the clothing you try, and you don’t need to show anyone. Just try to be open-minded about other styles of clothing. Remember, you won’t know how something looks on you unless you give it a try. You can dress according to your body type and abide by fashion tips, but at the end of the day, you should show off whatever you want to show off! If you love your shoulders, expose them in a plunging off the shoulder top. If you love your backside, wear a formfitting skirt to boast your behind. You know better than anyone what you’re working with, so highlight your best features. Don’t be afraid of bright colors – just make sure that the clothing fits appropriately! For a sleek look, try creating monochromatic outfits with various textures.  If you want to wear stripes, opt for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background. Vertical stripes will help you look slimmer than horizontal ones as well. If you particularly love a part of your body, wear fun, bright patterns on other parts to draw attention to it. While it's fun to highlight, accentuate, and maximize certain features, try not to worry about minimizing others. If there's an area of your body that you may not love as much as others, try something radical and show that area off! Dress to make yourself feel happy and confident, not to follow fashion \\"rules\\" or to hide your body.","output":"The article highlights the importance of choosing the right fabrics and being open to experimenting with different styles when dressing, especially for those who are heavily obese. Lightweight fabrics, such as silk and cotton, can cling to the body and be uncomfortable, while more substantial fabrics provide support and conceal undergarment lines. It advises not writing off lighter fabrics entirely, but rather trying various fabrics to discover what feels best. The author encourages stepping out of one's fashion comfort zone and trying new styles by selecting pieces not usually worn during clothes shopping. This experimentation can result in discovering a style that was never expected to be liked. No commitment to purchase or show others these new styles is required; it is merely a suggestion to maintain an open mind. Dressing according to one's body type and following fashion tips is advisable, but ultimately, it is crucial to wear what showcases the features one loves. The article suggests highlighting favorite features, whether it's shoulders, backside, or any other body part, and not being afraid of bright colors as long as the clothing fits well. Creating monochromatic outfits with varying textures can lead to a sleek look. Opting for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background helps in looking slimmer. Wearing bright patterns on body parts other than the area to be emphasized draws attention to the loved part. The main focus should be on feeling happy and confident in the outfit, rather than strictly adhering to fashion rules or hiding one's body. Experimenting and embracing different styles can potentially lead to increased self-confidence and satisfaction with one's attire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: Circle of Friends Movie plot: Set in 1950s Ireland, the film focuses on the experiences of Bernadette \\"Benny\\" Hogan and her two friends, Eve Malone and Nan Mahon. They are characterised early on in childhood, during their First Communion: Benny is the beloved and well-fed only child, Eve the orphan raised by nuns and Nan is destined to be defined by her beauty. The three girls grow up in the small town of Knockglen. Skip to eight years later: Nan has moved on to Dublin years earlier, and Benny and Eve have graduated from the local convent school and are heading to Dublin to attend university. Eve's education is financed by the local wealthy Westward Protestant family, her father's employers until his death. The family has also willed to her a cottage on their property. Eve boards at a convent in Dublin, while Benny must commute daily between home and Dublin, her parents being loath to let her go. They would prefer she marry the loathsome and creepy Sean Walsh, her father's faithful employee at his tailor shop. Once in Dublin the two girls reconnect with a mature and sophisticated Nan who is quite aware of her bewitching effect on the opposite sex. Benny eventually falls in love with Jack Foley, a handsome rugby player and doctor's son, studying medicine and expected to follow in his father's footsteps, though he is not quite convinced that this is the career for him. After the College Ball, Benny and Jack begin a relationship, Eve starts to date Aidan, a friend of Jack's, and Nan becomes involved with the much older Simon Westward, who the group ran into as they entered the dance and whom Nan \\"accidentally\\" arranged to run into at a lunch. While Benny is able to resist a physical relationship with Jack, Nan is not and believes that Simon truly loves her.

He could tell that she was unhappy. She told him how he did it.","output":"To determine whether \\"tell\\" is used to mean the same thing in these two sentences, let us examine the context and usage in each sentence. 1. In the sentence \\"He could tell that she was unhappy\\", the verb \\"tell\\" refers to the act of perceiving or recognizing a particular situation without necessarily being explicitly informed about it. In this context, \\"tell\\" is used to express that the person is able to understand that she is unhappy based on her actions, expressions, or other cues. 2. In the sentence \\"She told him how he did it\\", the verb \\"tell\\" refers to the act of giving information, instructions, or a narrative to someone in a direct manner. In this context, \\"tell\\" is used to express that she is explicitly conveying information about how he did something. Thus, the verb \\"tell\\" is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"tell\\" is related to perceiving or recognizing a situation, whereas in the second sentence, \\"tell\\" is related to directly providing information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who did the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland (from 1822-1840) marry? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, one must first identify the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland during the specified time period (1822-1840) and then determine who he married.  The Earl of Sunderland from 1822-1840 was Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (1786-1857). He was married to Lady Esther Acklom, but we aren’t looking for his spouse, but rather the spouse of his grandson. Charles Spencer and Lady Esther Acklom had several children, but three sons: John Spencer, Frederick Spencer, and George Spencer. As the eldest son, John Spencer (1820-1854) would have traditionally inherited the title upon his father's death; however, he died before his father. John Spencer did not have any children, so we'll focus on the other two sons. Frederick Spencer (1798-1857) became the 4th Earl Spencer after his older brother's death. Frederick married twice, first to Elizabeth Poyntz and then to Adelaide Horatia Seymour. He had several children, but for the purposes of this question, we will focus on the eldest child from each marriage. 1. Georgiana Frances Spencer (1823-1904) was the daughter of Frederick Spencer and Elizabeth Poyntz. 2. Charles Robert Spencer (1857–1922) was the grandson of Frederick Spencer, being the son of Frederick and Adelaide Horatia Seymour. He later became the 6th Earl Spencer. Considering the question asks for the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland, Charles Robert Spencer is our focus. He married Margaret Baring (1868-1906) in 1887. Margaret Baring was the daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, and Louisa Emily Bulteel. In conclusion, the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland from 1822-1840, namely Charles Robert Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, married Margaret Baring in 1887."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, other musicians and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote \\"The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end.\\" The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux \\"at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor\\". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was \\"something like a hostile reception\\" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season \\"was received with scarcely a sign of opposition\\". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as \\"knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down\\". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike.

OPTIONS:  * I was tired and needed to sleep .;  * I had a date .;  * None of the above choices .;  * I needed to clean my house .; Q: What may be the reason for not going out Friday night ?","output":"From the information provided, it seems that the main reason for not going out on Friday night was a combination of factors that ultimately led to the decision to stay in.  1. No one else was available to go: Sometimes the motivation to go out is tied to the company and the shared experience. The desire to go out on Friday night was tempered by the fact that no one else was available to join in on the fun, which could have made the prospect of going out less appealing. 2. Tiredness: It is mentioned that the individual's eyelids were too heavy, implying that they were quite tired. This would make it difficult not only to enjoy going out, but also to stay awake while doing so. Feeling tired may have impacted the willingness to go out alone, as sleep became a more appealing option under the circumstances. 3. A potential continuation of a hot streak: The individual mentions the possibility of continuing their hot streak if they were to go out, suggesting that they may have had recent successes in social or other activities. Seeking excitement and positive experiences are natural reasons for wanting to go out and socialize. However, in this case, the tiredness and lack of companionship may have been stronger factors that influenced the decision to stay home instead. While the provided options of needing to sleep, having a date, and needing to clean the house could also be valid reasons for not going out on Friday night, the key factors at play here seem to be the unavailability of friends, tiredness, and the possibility of a less enjoyable experience due to going on their own. Therefore, the most accurate choice from the given options would likely be: * I was tired and needed to sleep. This choice captures the impact of tiredness on the decision-making process, but it is important to remember that it was not the sole reason for staying home on Friday night. The absence of friends to share the experience with and the influence of fatigue together largely contributed to the choice of staying in rather than going out."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"Climate change, as a result of human activities, can be considered as a process with multiple steps. Given that your question references the supposed perturbation's impact on the steps of this process, it is important to understand each step and evaluate how the perturbation would affect less global warming. The steps of the process as you've outlined are: 1. Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) 2. Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enters the atmosphere 3. The make-up of the atmosphere changes 4. Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere 5. The Earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy 6. Human beings cut down trees 7. Human beings do not re-plant the trees 8. Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 9. The extra trapped energy starts to change the Earth's short-term weather 10. Eventually, the long-term climate patterns start to change Now let's consider the potential perturbations: a) Directly impacting a step of the process b) Indirectly impacting a step of the process c) Not impacting any step of the process To promote less global warming, the perturbation would need to be actively and positively influencing the processes, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions or increased carbon capture. a) Directly impacting a step of the process: Examples of direct impacts on the process could include decreasing fossil fuel consumption by using alternative energy sources (Step 1), utilizing carbon capture technologies (Step 2), or increasing afforestation and reforestation efforts (Steps 6 and 7). These direct impacts would intervene in the process and reduce the overall effect of human activities on the atmosphere and climate change, ultimately leading to less global warming. b) Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Indirectly impacting a step of the process involves altering certain factors that positively affect the steps, but without directly intervening in them. Examples of indirect impacts may include implementing policies to encourage the use of renewable energy and discourage fossil fuel dependency (Step 1), offering incentives for reforestation or afforestation projects (Steps 6 and 7), or promoting awareness and behavioral changes to reduce carbon footprints (Steps 1, 6, and 7). These indirect impacts could generate a positive influence on the process and contribute to less global warming as a result. c) Not impacting any step of the process: This option implies that the perturbation would not have any effect on the identified steps, neither directly nor indirectly. In this case, the perturbation would not contribute to reducing global warming, as it would not influence any of the contributing factors. In conclusion, if the goal is to achieve less global warming, the perturbation should either directly or indirectly impact a step of the process, positively altering the factors contributing to climate change and, as a result, limiting its overall effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\"? , can you please find it?   The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person that James H. Mapleson thought of as \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\" is Marguerite Chapuy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school? Jenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, \\"What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time.\\" However, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract   numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation   as it is about learning to think logically   and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems. For example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests. How should you divide your resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently  ?

In Russian, the word for \\"differences\\" is \\"различия.\\" The word order in this sentence is the same as in English.   2. \\"are\\" = \\"есть\\" - This is the verb, in this case, it is \\"to be\\" in third person plural. However, in Russian, often the verb \\"to be\\" (быть) is omitted when it links the subject and the predicate, only used in past and future tenses. So in this case, we don't include the equivalent verb \\"есть\\" in the translation. 3. \\"highly\\" = \\"крайне\\" - This is an adverb used to intensify the meaning of the adjective that follows, \\"instructive.\\" The appropriate Russian adverb for \\"highly\\" is \\"крайне.\\" 4. \\"instructive\\" = \\"познавательны\\" - This is the adjective, which reflects the key characteristic of the differences mentioned. The Russian word for \\"instructive\\" is \\"познавательный\\" in its masculine form, but since it modifies the plural noun \\"различия,\\" it will take on the plural form and become \\"познавательны.” So, putting it all together, we have \\"Различия крайне познавательны,\\" which translates to \\"The differences are highly instructive.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, suggests that if more plants die in soft mud, it would likely lead to an increase in fossil formation. This hypothesis would have a direct effect on the process of fossil formation. When more plants die in soft soil or mud, there is an increased supply of organic material that could eventually become fossils. As sediment continues to build up over the remains, the likelihood of these organic materials being preserved and not decomposing completely increases. This provides a better environment for fossilization to occur. Over time, the remains will continue to decompose, leaving only trace amounts of the original organic material. These remaining parts are gradually replaced with minerals, ultimately leading to the formation of fossils. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in plants dying in soft mud would lead to more fossils forming. This is due to the increased supply of organic material and the better conditions for preservation and fossilization.

One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation.

Write an article based on this summary: Spanish researchers have created a robot posing as a 14-year-old girl to spot paedophiles in online chatrooms.","output":"Title: Online Sting: Spanish Researchers Develop Robot Posing as 14-Year-Old Girl to Catch Predatory Chatters Introduction In an increasingly digital-focused world, safeguarding children from online predators has become an exigent need. Social media platforms and chatrooms have provided an ideal breeding ground for the proliferation of online predators. In a bid to monitor and identify individuals who engage in predatory behavior with minors online, a team of Spanish researchers have created a groundbreaking new tool: a robot posing as a 14-year-old girl to trap pedophiles in online chatrooms. The Development of the Chatbot The Spanish research team, recognizing the need for advanced technology to tackle the soaring cases of online predatory behavior, devised a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) robot to infiltrate online chatrooms. The chatbot, designed to pose as a 14-year-old girl named \\"Sweetie 2.0\\", is equipped with a powerful algorithm and programmed with the ability to identify and communicate with potential predators, without raising suspicion. In essence, the groundbreaking chatbot mimics casual teenage conversation in order to avoid detection, continuously improving its conversational abilities by learning from the chats it partakes in. To create a realistic online persona, the chatbot's developers diligently conducted a linguistic analysis of teenage chats, incorporating colloquial expressions and internet slang that a typical 14-year-old would employ. Consequently, the AI-driven system effectively lures in individuals seeking to exploit minors for illegal or unethical purposes. How the Chatbot Identifies and Entraps Predators One of the most crucial aspects of this innovative chatbot is its ability to effectively identify predators. To accomplish this, the chatbot employs intelligent algorithms that assess the likelihood of specific users engaging in illicit behavior, such as grooming minors for sexual purposes. These algorithms analyze several crucial factors, including the language used by the interlocutor, personal information exchanged, the age difference between the individuals, and the overall tone of the conversation. Once the chatbot has identified an online predator, it continues to interact with the individual, engaging them in a conversation with the aim of gathering sufficient evidence for identifying and prosecuting the offender. The entity responsible for the chatbot's deployment, typically a law enforcement agency, can then use the evidence acquired by the AI system to launch an investigation before proceeding with prosecution, thereby spearheading the crackdown against online child exploitation. Advantages and Challenges The Sweetie 2.0 chatbot offers a myriad of advantages in combating online child exploitation. Here are a few: 1. Continuous Monitoring: The chatbot is capable of constant activity and does not require rest, enabling regular surveillance of chatrooms. 2. Scalable Operations: The chatbot can address various online chatrooms simultaneously, allowing law enforcement to cover a broader spectrum of potential threats. 3. Swift Execution: The chatbot helps in accelerating investigations by swiftly identifying potential threats, significantly reducing the time required for evidence gathering. However, the AI chatbot also presents some challenges: 1. Ethical Concerns: The chatbot's integration in chatrooms has raised certain ethical concerns, particularly surrounding entrapment and privacy. The issue of whether individuals are being unfairly provoked and baited into committing crimes, as well as the general online surveillance, poses a significant challenge. 2. Legal Framework: As the use of AI technology within law enforcement is still a relatively new concept, certain legal frameworks and regulations need to be adapted for its effective integration. Conclusion The Spanish researchers' development of the AI chatbot represents a substantial leap in the fight against online child exploitation. The cutting-edge technology provides law enforcement with a new avenue to identify and prosecute offenders. However, it is imperative that ethical and legal challenges are addressed to ensure that this technological advancement achieves its intended goal, safeguarding the well-being of minors in an increasingly digital world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: When can I get a cell phone?\\" The answer is when your parents think you need one, though many kids seem to be getting them around age 12 or 13. Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access  to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK. If you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on. You'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged  and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom.

Q:What is the first name of the person who was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint.

Hello, little one! Today, we are going to answer a fun question about a player named Murray and the number of games he played in two different years - 1994 and 1995. Let's turn this into a little story to make it easy for you to understand. Once upon a time, in 1994, there was a sports player named Murray. He loved playing games and participated in many of them. People enjoyed watching him play because he was very skilled and talented. Then, in 1995, Murray decided that he wanted to play even more games. So, he played and played, and people kept wondering how many more games he played that year compared to the 1994 season. Let's help them find the answer! First things first: we need to find out how many games Murray played in 1994. Let's say he played 20 games in that season. Now, we need to figure out how many games he played in 1995. Let's imagine Murray played 35 games in the 1995 season. To see how many more games he played in 1995 when compared to 1994, we have to do a little bit of math. But don't worry! It's really easy and fun. Here's what we need to do: 1. Take the number of games Murray played in 1995 (35 games) 2. Minus the number of games Murray played in 1994 (20 games) Now let's subtract: 35 games (from the 1995 season) - 20 games (from the 1994 season) = 15 games So, Murray played 15 more games in the 1995 season compared to the 1994 season. Yay, we found the answer! Murray must have been very happy that he got to play even more games in 1995. And that's the end of our little story. I hope you enjoyed it and now understand how we figured out the difference in the number of games Murray played in those two years. Remember, comparing numbers can be a lot of fun, and it can help us learn interesting things about people, sports, or many other topics!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose thoughts on what inspired him to such an individual mode of expression art historians have struggled with?  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

It contains information about fire prevention divided into three topics: inflammable materials, heat, and oxygen. 2. Use your Knowledge of Xhosa: Your Xhosa needs to be strong enough to translate the phrase accurately while retaining its initial meaning.

In other words, you can't translate word by word; you must understand how thoughts are expressed in both languages and pick the best words in Xhosa to convey the original English sentence. 3. Use Resources if Needed: You can use Xhosa dictionaries or language translation tools if you need clarity or confirmation of specific words or phrases. However, be aware that automated translations aren’t always accurate. So it’s always helpful to double-check with a reliable source or person proficient in Xhosa. 4.

Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, \\"Glorious John\\", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: \\"For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.\\" Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz, \\"there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, there was a conductor!'\\"Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\"?

Q:It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

So, the task here is to read the provided text carefully and to determine which option—A) different purposes in the interview, B) different experiences in interviews, C) different standards of selection, or D) different ways of selection—best fits the blank space in the sentence \\"People argue over the interview mainly because they have _.\\" The text talks about the varied opinions employers and candidates have on the interview process as a selection tool, stating that the arguments are centered on whether or not the process is an effective way of determining a candidate's suitability for a position. This suggests a difference not in the interview's purpose, nor in their individual experiences, but in the way they think selection should be rightfully carried out.  Therefore, considering the given options and the overall context of the text, the most appropriate one to complete the sentence is D) \\"different ways of selection\\". The sentence would read: \\"People argue over the interview mainly because they have different ways of selection.\\"  This conclusion is drawn, as the passage indicates that not everyone agrees on the interview being the correct or only method of selection—some may believe in assessing personality and likability through interviews, while others may emphasize more on educational background, special skills, and work experience. Thus, their ways or methods of selection differ, leading to arguments over the validity and reliability of interviews as a selection tool."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Giants Tie Mark and Stifle Eagles With 12 Sacks “Sacks come in bunches, man,” Umenyiora said with a heavy dose of understatement. He tried to play down his numbers, but teammates needled him on the sideline in the closing moments of the game. “They were like, ‘It’s like a video game for you out there,’” Umenyiora said. The Giants allowed 97 points in the first two and a half games of the season, but only 3 in the past game and a half. The unit of the first-year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who spent the previous eight seasons as an assistant for the Eagles, appeared to take hold at the perfect time. A week earlier, in a 56-21 victory over Detroit, McNabb completed 21 of 26 for 381 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Against the Giants, McNabb completed 15 of 31 passes for 138 yards. The dozen sacks accounted for 62 yards in losses, leaving the Eagles only 76 net yards passing. The Eagles’ offense was helpless against a Giants defense gaining confidence with nearly every snap. But it was also short-handed because of a slew of injured players, most of them late, surprising scratches from the lineup. Most notably, running back Brian Westbrook, the league leader in yards from scrimmage through three games, did not dress for the game because of a nagging abdominal strain. Left tackle William Thomas’s absence because of a sore knee forced the backup Winston Justice to make his first N.F.L. start. Umenyiora, from the right end position, picked on Justice for most of his sacks, and other defensive linemen took turns pushing, pulling and throwing McNabb to the Giants Stadium turf. Umenyiora had never recorded more than two sacks in a game, and had just one sack in his previous eight regular-season games. Defenders entered the Eagles’ offensive backfield from all directions, but the Giants were surprised that the Eagles left Justice alone to fight off the onslaught. Philadelphia made few attempts to double-team Umenyiora. “Maybe they figured things would go a different way,” said linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka, who often played on the line of scrimmage and had three sacks. “Who knows? The bottom line is, we’ve got Osi on our team.” Still, the score was tighter than the game felt. The Giants’ offense, rewarded frequently with good field position, was consistent only in squandering chances. The Giants scored their only offensive touchdown midway through the second quarter when quarterback Eli Manning arced a pass to the left side of the end zone. The 6-foot-5 receiver Plaxico Burress snagged it over the top of cornerback Sheldon Brown, who is 7 inches shorter. A long first-quarter march ended with a missed 34-yard field-goal attempt by Lawrence Tynes. A second-quarter drive reached Philadelphia’s 15-yard line, but Manning threw an interception into the hands of linebacker Omar Gaither while trying to complete a short pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. A third-quarter drive reached the 10-yard line, but ended with a field goal and a 10-0 lead with 2 minutes 3 seconds left in the period. That is when the defense took control of the scoreboard. On the next play, McNabb fumbled, the ball appearing to brush fullback Thomas Tapeh’s elbow as McNabb retreated. Mitchell jumped on the loose ball, scrambled to his feet and ran 17 yards into the end zone. “Comfort, confidence,” Mitchell succinctly explained when asked about the transformation of the team’s defense. Tynes missed the extra-point attempt by hitting the upright, leaving the Giants with a 16-0 lead entering the fourth quarter. The Giants’ defense did the rest. The Eagles managed their only points on a 53-yard field goal by David Akers early in the fourth quarter. The next time they got the ball, Kiwanuka and Umenyiora sacked McNabb on consecutive plays — the first setting the team record for sacks in a game, the next giving Umenyiora the individual mark. Strahan’s sack, midway through the second quarter, pushed his career total to 133 ½. That broke the official franchise mark he shared for nearly a year with the former linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Strahan celebrated by pointing two fingers skyward into the darkness as Taylor watched from the sideline. But Taylor’s total of 132 ½ does not include the 9 ½ he notched as a rookie in 1981, because the N.F.L. did not count sacks as an official statistic until 1982. Taylor playfully reminded Strahan that he “has some more work to do.” The best chance for the Eagles to score a touchdown came just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. But on fourth-and-18 from the Giants’ 24-yard line, McNabb was sacked, appropriately and predictably, by Umenyiora. Fans rose to their feet as McNabb fell. A new defense had been christened, and a season was flush with renewed expectations.

Review: First ordered 2 day shipping,got charged 30 dollars for the shipping.it arrived 6 days after ordering,i was also notified this order cancelled through amazon because couldnt make delivery date so bought something elsewhere and then when it showed up i was very dissappointed at what it actually was for the money charged.About 75 dollars later i will never buy anything through this company again! Answer: The answer is:","output":"No, this product review is not positive.  The reviewer clearly expresses dissatisfaction and frustration at various aspects of the transaction, from ordering to delivery and product quality. These aspects form a negative overall evaluation of the product and service provided by the company. The disappointment starts with the shipping process. The reviewer notes that they paid for 2-day shipping but the product arrived 4 days late, meaning the company failed to meet the expectations set by their shipping promise. Moreover, the reviewer raises the issue of being charged 30 dollars for a service that was not delivered as promised, indicating a perceived lack of value for money. Next, regardless of the delivery delay, the reviewer was notified that the order had been cancelled because the company couldn't meet the delivery date. Subsequently, they purchased a replacement product from elsewhere. However, to their surprise, the original order still arrived even though they got a cancellation notice. This  confusion and lack of clear communication further contributes to the reviewer's negative sentiment. Finally, upon receiving the product, they express that they were 'very disappointed at what it actually was for the money charged', suggesting that the product's quality or functionality did not match up to its cost, thus highlighting a discrepancy between the expectations and reality.  Their decision to 'never buy anything through this company again' serves as a direct declaration of their dissatisfaction and a portrayal of the profound impact of their negative experience. This statement also suggests a low level of trust in the company due to their negative encounter.  In conclusion, posing frustration, dissatisfaction, and disappointment, the review is decidedly negative. It serves as feedback and warning to other potential customers about their possible experiences. It also suggests areas for improvement for the company in the areas of shipping, communication, and product quality."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets. 3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground \\"playing Wickerman\\". The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison. I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Now, let's think about this equation (6 * c = 48): If you have 6 candies and you want to divide them equally among some number of kids, how many candies will each kid get?

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after Hernán Cortés left to explore the Mexican coast did Tenochtitlan fall to the Spanish?","output":"Title: The Fall of Tenochtitlan: How Long Did It Take After Cortés Left for Spaniards to Conquer Mexico? Introduction: Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, embarked on an expedition to explore the coast of Mexico in the early 16th century. This journey paved the way for the eventual Spanish conquest of the mighty Aztec Empire, with its capital Tenochtitlan at the heart of the struggle. The timing of these events is vital in understanding the sequence of events that led to the fall of the Aztec Empire. In this article, we will examine the duration between Hernán Cortés' departure from Spain and the demise of Tenochtitlan. Step 1: Establish the date Hernán Cortés started his expedition. Cortés initiated his journey to explore the Mexican coast in 1518. He was given the responsibility of establishing initial contact and trade relations with the indigenous people of the region. In November 1518, he sailed to Mexico with a fleet of 11 ships and hundreds of soldiers, starting his exploration of the unknown territories. Step 2: Identify the year Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish. The British historian Hugh Thomas records that the fall of Tenochtitlan occurred on August 13, 1521. After months of siege warfare, Spanish forces led by Hernán Cortés and their indigenous allies managed to breach the city's defenses, capturing the Aztec ruler, Cuauhtémoc. The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of the mighty Aztec Empire. Step 3: Calculate the time gap between Cortés' departure and Tenochtitlan's fall. To determine the time gap between Hernán Cortés' departure and the fall of Tenochtitlan, we need to calculate the difference between 1518 and 1521. Here is the calculation:  1521 (Fall of Tenochtitlan) - 1518 (Cortés' expedition starts) = 3 years Conclusion: In summary, it took three years after Hernán Cortés left to explore the Mexican coast for the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan to fall to the Spanish forces. This period saw an intricate sequence of events, including the formation of alliances with local tribes, battles, and the instigation of the smallpox outbreak among the indigenous people, which contributed to the ultimate defeat of the Aztec Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who does Pete ask if he's seen a guy that he can't see? ?  Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".  Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen.  But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.  When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground.  Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline.  Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again.  However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.  When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\"  The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.

Write a summary based on this article: PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Wednesday renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, in a largely symbolic move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said.      U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis arrives to testify before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on funding for the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas      U.S. Pacific Command, which is responsible for all U.S. military activity in the greater Pacific region, has about 375,000 civilian and military personnel assigned to its area of responsibility, which includes India.      “Relationships with our Pacific and Indian Ocean allies and partners have proven critical to maintaining regional stability,” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks.      “In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, today we rename the U.S. Pacific Command to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,” Mattis said.      He was speaking during a change of command ceremony. Admiral Philip Davidson was assuming leadership of the command from Admiral Harry Harris, who is President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea.      The renaming does not mean additional assets will be sent to the region at this time, but rather recognizes India’s increasing military relevance for the United States.      In 2016, the United States and India signed an agreement governing the use of each other’s land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China.      Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said they had noted the name change.      “We will continue to pay attention to developments,” he told a regular monthly news briefing.      The United States is also keen to tap into India’s large defense market. It has emerged as India’s No. 2 weapons supplier, closing 15 billion worth of deals over the last decade.      Mattis has been pushing for a waiver for countries like India, after Trump signed a law last year which said that any country trading with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors would face sanctions.      “I think India and the relationship with the United States is the potentially most historic opportunity we have in the 21st-century and I intend to pursue that quite rigorously,” Davidson, the incoming head of the command, said last month.      However, experts said the name change would mean little unless it was tied to a broader strategy.      “Renaming PACOM is ultimately a symbolic act ... (it) will have a very limited impact unless the U.S. follows through with a significant array of initiatives and investments that reflect a wider aperture,” said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama. ||||| (CNN) The US announced Wednesday that it would rebrand the command responsible for overseeing US military operations in Asia, a move that comes amid heightened tensions with China over the militarization of the South China Sea.      US Pacific Command will now be called US Indo-Pacific Command, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said while speaking at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii, where the command's headquarters is located.      \\"In recognition of the increasing connectivity of the Indian and Pacific Oceans today we rename the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,\\" Mattis said.      \\"It is our primary combatant command, it's standing watch and intimately engaged with over half of the earth's surface and its diverse populations, from Hollywood, to Bollywood, from polar bears to penguins,\\" Mattis said of the command.      Adm. Harry Harris, who oversaw US military operations in the region until Wednesday, has been tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as the US ambassador to South Korea. Adm. Phillip Davidson will now lead the Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees some 375,000 US military and civilian personnel.      Read More ||||| Summary:","output":"The United States military has changed the name of its Pacific Command to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. This change is mostly a symbol to show that India is becoming more important to the U.S. military. The Indo-Pacific Command helps keep peace in a large part of the world, including India. By changing the name, the United States wants to show that it's working well with countries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This change doesn't mean there will be more military stuff in that area, but it tells people that India's help in the military is important to the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A man in a black hat and tan jacket walking across the street.\\", can we conclude \\"A man in a black hat and tan jacket walking slowly\\"?","output":"From the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that the man in the black hat and tan jacket is walking slowly across the street. The original description - \\"A man in a black hat and tan jacket walking across the street\\" - does not provide any information about the speed of the man walking. In order to make such a conclusion, we would need additional details about the man's walking speed or behavioral cues that suggest he is walking slowly. For example, if the description indicated that the man was taking leisurely steps or was traversing a great deal of time to cross the street, then we could draw the conclusion that he was walking slowly. However, without any additional information about the man's walking speed, making the assumption that he was walking slowly would be based solely on speculation. Analyzing the information given in each sentence, here are the details we have at hand: - The man is in a black hat and tan jacket. - The man is walking across the street. These details give us an understanding of the person's appearance and actions, but not an indicator of his walking speed. To assume that he is walking slowly would be adding information not provided in the original description and may lead us to construct an inaccurate mental image of the scene.

During 2002, the average remained subdued without making substantial gains due to the stock market downturn of 2002 as well as the lingering effects of the dot-com bubble. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level range by the early 2000s recession, the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) and the Iraq War. But by December of that year, the Dow remarkably returned to the 10,000 mark. In October 2006, four years after its bear market low, the DJIA set fresh record theoretical, intra-day, daily close, weekly, and monthly highs for the first time in almost seven years, closing above the 12,000 level for the first time on the 19th anniversary of Black Monday (1987) (1987). On February 27, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.3% (415.30 points), its biggest point drop since 2001. The initial drop was caused by a global sell-off after SSE Composite experienced a Chinese correction, yet by April 25, the Dow passed the 13,000 level in trading and closed above that milestone for the first time. On July 19, 2007, the average passed the 14,000 level, completing the fastest 1,000-point advance for the index since 1999. One week later, a 450-point intra-day loss, owing to turbulence in the U.S. Subprime lending market and the soaring value of the Chinese yuan, initiated another correction falling below the 13,000 mark, about 10% from its highs. Answer this question based on the article: How many points difference was there between the drop on February 27, 2007 and the drop in July of 2007?","output":"To answer this question, we first need to find the point drops in February and July 2007.

Now, we will find the difference between these two point drops: 450 - 415.30 = 34.7 points So, there is a 34.7 points difference between the drop on February 27, 2007, and the drop in July of 2007."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Claudelle and Linn instantly hit it off together, and soon they fall in love. Her mother objects to the relationship, fearing Claudelle will end up in the same rut she is, being married to a poor farmer, resulting in a stormy marriage. Claudelle is forced to endure her parents' many arguments stemming from Jessie's unhappiness having to be married to Clyde, a poor but hard-working farmer.

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself. In other words, it can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. Step 3: Start checking for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the given number (since any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root). In this case, the square root of 60029 is approximately 244.9. So, we need to check divisibility from 2 to 244. Step 4: Check divisibility for each number in the range (2 to 244). If the given number is divisible by any number in the range, it is not a prime number. Step 5: After checking the divisibility for all the numbers in the range, we find that the number 60029 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Look online to find if your helmet visor can be replaced for one that has pin lock. Pin lock is two pins on a visor and an insert that clips in. This system effectively prevents fogging and provides better visibility during cold weather by creating a double-glazed window, allowing you to maintain a clear view of your surroundings. Additionally, opt for a helmet with proper insulation and adequate vents to ensure both warmth and breathability, preventing moisture buildup and maintaining optimal temperature at all times. When selecting your motorbike gear, it's crucial to focus on layering and choosing materials that provide excellent thermal insulation while remaining lightweight and flexible. Start with moisture-wicking base layers, made of high-quality fabrics like merino wool or synthetic materials, which will keep you dry and ensure proper heat regulation. Compression garments can also be useful in promoting blood circulation and reducing fatigue during long rides. Next, consider investing in a mid-layer that allows for heat retention and breathability, such as fleece or other insulating materials. This layer should be comfortable without adding bulk, ensuring ease of movement and an overall good fit. An adjustable collar or turtleneck can also be helpful in sealing off openings, keeping your neck warm and minimizing exposure to chilly winds. For your outer layer, look for a high-quality, waterproof yet breathable jacket and pants, designed specifically for winter motorbike riding. These garments should come equipped with both thermal insulation and ventilation systems, allowing you to stay warm while keeping sweat and moisture at bay. Ensure that the garments have reinforced areas, such as elbows and knees, as well as adjustable cuffs and waistbands for optimal fit and protection. Gloves and boots, too, can significantly impact your winter motorbike riding experience. Select gloves with thermal insulation and waterproof capabilities that provide a comfortable grip on your bike's handlebars. A safe option would be gauntlet-style gloves, which extend up over your jacket sleeve, ensuring no cold air penetrates your hands. Similarly, choose waterproof boots with a strong grip, adequate insulation, and protection for your ankles. Maximizing visibility in challenging road conditions is also essential during winter rides. Opt for high-visibility or reflective wear, such as vests, jackets, and pants, to ensure your presence stands out to other motorists, reducing the risk of accidents. Adding reflective decals or tape can help enhance your visibility as well. Finally, invest in motorbike-specific winter accessories such as heated grips, handguard extensions, and waterproof seat covers to further enhance your comfort and safety during rides. By equipping yourself with the appropriate helmet, gear, and accessories, you can enjoy a safer and more comfortable winter motorbike riding experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But his magical world - where witches   cast spells and castles float in the sky - is brought to life by hand. Nevertheless, Hayao Miyazaki is referred to as Japan's Walt Disney and considered by many to be the world's greatest living animator. This month, the 72-year-old Miyazaki announced his retirement. The Japanese animator has directed 11 animated full-length films over the past four decades, including the Oscar-winning Spirited Away (<<>> ) and his latest release, The Wind Rises (<<>> ), which tells the life story of a man who designed Japanese World War II fighter planes. Just as The Wind Rises shows, Miyazaki is well-known for his obsession with flight, especially human flight. Other striking aspects of Miyazaki's films include his themes of environmental protection and the horrors of war. Miyazaki's work is also famous for its lack of clearly defined good and evil characters. He sees the 21st century as a complex time when old norms need to be re-examined. As a storyteller, he is an inventor of fairy tales full of mystery. In the Miyazakian universe, wizards   turn into birds of prey; young girls are transformed overnight into 90-year-old women; greedy parents are changed into pigs; and shooting stars become fire demons  . As a visual   artist, most of Miyazaki's grace comes from his vivid   colors and lovingly drawn landscapes - a rolling meadow   covered with flowers and shadowed by clouds, or a range of rocky hills rising toward snow-capped mountain peaks People attribute Miyazaki's success to his long pursuit of his hand-drawn technique, although in an interview with CNN he called himself an \\"extinct species\\" in the age of digital animation.

Step 1: Define plasma lipoproteins Plasma lipoproteins are complex particles composed of lipids and proteins that transport lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood. They play a critical role in lipid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis in our body. Step 2: Identify the four major types of plasma lipoproteins 1. Chylomicrons: Chylomicrons are the largest and least dense lipoproteins, primarily responsible for transporting dietary lipids (fats) from the intestine to other tissues in the body. They mainly carry triglycerides. 2. Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL): VLDL particles are synthesized in the liver and responsible for transporting endogenous lipids, primarily triglycerides, to peripheral tissues. VLDL particles also evolve into intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and later Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL) as they lose triglycerides. 3. Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL): Also known as \\"bad cholesterol,\\" LDL lipoproteins primarily transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. High levels of LDL increase the risk of atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. 4. High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL): Referred to as \\"good cholesterol,\\" HDL particles are involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which helps remove excess cholesterol from tissues, including the arterial wall, and return it to the liver for excretion. Higher levels of HDL are generally associated with a lower risk of heart disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Rating Criteria: Typically, a rating from 1-5 scale is based on how positive or negative the review is, with 5 being the most positive and 1 being the most negative or least favorable. 3. Analyzing the Review: Since the user has not given any positive or negative feedback about their experience (since they apparently haven't tried the product or service yet), it's not possible to give a rating based on their sentiments.  4. Conclusion: Therefore, given the lack of any substantial information about the user's experience with the product/service in question, I would rate it as 1, the least favorable, as it doesn't provide any useful feedback.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Iraq produces its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Iran uses nuclear fission as its energy source.  and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Please answer this question : Which country causes more environmental problems? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Iraq causes more environmental problems than Iran due to its reliance on fossil fuels for electricity production. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases, contributing to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. These negative environmental impacts have significant consequences on human health, ecosystems, and the planet's climate. In contrast, Iran uses nuclear fission as its primary energy source for electricity production. While it is true that radioactive elements are limited and may eventually run out, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause other environmental problems typically associated with burning fossil fuels. The major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy is that it helps mitigate climate change and air pollution impacts. However, it is essential to consider other potential consequences of nuclear power, such as the risk of accidents, disposal of radioactive waste, and the potential for nuclear material to be used for nefarious purposes. Nevertheless, from an environmental perspective, the immediate impacts of fossil fuel usage are more harmful, and thus, Iraq's electricity production can be considered more environmentally detrimental than Iran's. It is important to note that moving towards cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, would help both countries minimize their environmental footprint and reduce their reliance on nonrenewable resources. These alternative energy solutions offer a more sustainable approach to electricity production while addressing global concerns about climate change and environmental degradation."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

How to Use iCloud to Find Your Lost Phone So your iPhone is gone. Before you panic and run over to the Apple Store and spend a few hundred dollars on a new one, please know that there’s an easy way to locate your lost iPhone. Here’s how to do it, assuming that you set up Apple’s Find My iPhone feature before you misplaced your device. If you haven’t done that yet and you still have your iPhone, now’s a good time to set it up just in case. After you’ve made sure that your iPhone is not, in fact, in your jacket pocket, purse or the other room, your first step is to visit Apple’s iCloud website. Once you’ve logged in, hit the “Find My iPhone” button. The site will automatically load a map and note your iPhone’s location with a green dot. If you have multiple Apple devices attached to the same iCloud account, the site will prompt you to select which device you want to locate. At this point, it’s important to wait a few moments while your iPhone’s GPS adjusts and more accurately pinpoints itself on the map. Once you select the device, you can also monitor its battery life. One caveat here: If your iPhone’s battery is dead, Find My iPhone will only display the device’s last known location. Helpfully, Apple’s iOS 8 upgrade introduced a new feature that has your iPhone transmit its last known location just before its battery dies. Turn this on in Settings -> iCloud -> Find My iPhone -> Send Last Location. Sometimes, the map will show your iPhone in a general area within a block or two of its actual location. This should, however, be enough to remind you where you left the device. iCloud also allows you to play a loud, annoying noise from your iPhone to make it easier to find, even if it’s stuck on silent mode. As you search for your device, iCloud also lets you activate your iPhone’s “Lost Mode,” which locks it with a 4-digit pin so nobody can use it. It also gives you the option of displaying a custom distress message across the lock screen with essential contact information. More importantly, if you have credit cards synced to Apple Pay, Lost Mode disables all payment options. In a worst case scenario — like if your iPhone was stolen — you have the option of remotely erasing your phone, which is a lot like that scene in Argo when staffers at the American embassy start shredding and burning documents. Which is to say, if you’ve given up hope entirely, you can purge it of all personal data. These features are also available on Apple’s Find My iPhone iOS app. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how to use iCloud to find your lost iPhone.

Background: X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. Context: X then signed to Elektra in 1982 to release Under the Big Black Sun, which marked a slight departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The album was heavily influenced by the death of Cervenka's elder sister Mirielle (Mary) in a 1980 automobile accident. Three songs on the album (\\"Riding with Mary\\", \\"Come Back to Me\\" and the title track) all directly related to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of Al Dubin and Joe Burke's \\"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\\", was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka's mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album  \\"You know, my favorite record is Under the Big Black Sun, so everything else is kind of . . .  I'm saying if I had to sit down in a room and put on an X record--which I don't generally do--I have recently listened to some X records but I generally don't listen to myself--the record I would pick to listen to would be Under the Big Black Sun.  In 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the More Fun in the New World album, making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band's rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\", and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The record received critical praise from Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound.  The Knitters, a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of the Red Devils) on double bass, and released the Poor Little Critter on the Road album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; their take on Merle Haggard's \\"Silver Wings\\" \\"may be the definitive version\\". Question: What was the sound of the album \\"More Fun in the New World\\"?. Whats the answer?","output":"The sound of the album \\"More Fun in the New World\\" by X marked a shift in the band's musical direction while still retaining their punk rock origins. This album demonstrated a more polished, eclectic, and radio-ready sound compared to their previous albums. The band's rockabilly influence became more noticeable, and they incorporated new elements such as funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\" and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The album received critical acclaim from publications like Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had been supportive of X and their unique sound.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building. Lieutenant Thơ, who had earlier urged Diệm to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle Đỗ Mậu, along with Đính and Khiêm, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \\"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\\". Answer:","output":"The name of the building the congregation left soon after morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day is the Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Restaurant 's space was bright (large windows facing the parking lot and street), uncluttered, and attractive (shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it).  I asked if we were to seat ourselves, and I was told that we were to order at the counter and that we could then seat anywhere we wanted to.  I try to get a few suggestions wherever I go not only to check for allergens, but also for good customer service; it never sits well with me if staff members aren't able to suggest anything off of the menu.  After hearing a few enthusiastic lunch suggestions from the cashier, I placed in our order: a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit toppings (peaches and berries) for Mom, and a combo of half a Reubenesque panini and a small mixed salad.  It took about fifteen minutes before the food arrived, which gave us time to chit-chat and this was when I noticed the restaurant's surroundings.  I thought it cool to be able to watch the two cooks prepare the orders behind the counter.  My Mom LOVED the waffle with the fresh fruit toppings!  Her plate arrived with two 4x4-inch waffles, one with peaches and the other with sliced strawberries, a slice of pineapple and an orange wedge, all sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Mom sensed something was missing, and after asking for whipped cream, she and the waffles were fast friends.  My small salad looked beautiful- mixed greens with glazed pecans, a few pear slices, and blue cheese crumbles, a slice of grilled foccacia bread and a side of citrus vinaigrette.  My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef, swiss cheese, fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny (Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away), but it was full of flavor.  The combo was a definite hit with me, even though I did end up with a few allergy symptoms.    Kudos to AC for winning over my Mom... we will visit again to try other menu selections soon!","output":"This review is positive! The person writing it liked the restaurant and enjoyed their time there. They mentioned the nice atmosphere, good customer service, and tasty food.

In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as 49ers CB Allen Rossum returned the game's opening kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals would respond as kicker Neil Rackers got a 28-yard field goal. In the second quarter, San Francisco added onto their lead as QB Shaun Hill completed a 31-yard TD pass to WR Josh Morgan.

The Four Cs of 21st century learning, also known as the Four Cs or 4 Cs, are four skills that have been identified by the United States-based Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) as the most important skills required for 21st century education: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. Can we draw the following conclusion? The 4 C's may go on to be the most important skills of the 22nd century.","output":"The 4 Cs of 21st century learning—critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity—have indeed been identified as crucial skills for success in our modern, rapidly changing world. Given their importance in education today and contemporary work environments, it is worth considering the likelihood that these skills will remain essential or even grow in significance throughout the coming century. However, to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the future importance of the 4 Cs in the 22nd century, we must first analyze the function and relevance of each of these skills in detail and discuss potential changes in future societies. 1. Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is the ability to think in a clear, logical, and discerning manner, which includes problem-solving, rational analysis, and decision-making. In our modern world, where we are inundated with information, individuals must be adept at analyzing and evaluating information critically. As future societies become increasingly interconnected, and as the pace of technological innovation accelerates, the necessity for individuals to possess strong critical thinking skills in order to navigate complex issues will likely remain paramount. 2. Communication: Effective communication is the capacity to convey and understand thoughts, ideas, and information in verbal, written, or nonverbal form. As globalization continues and cross-cultural communication becomes even more prevalent, the ability to communicate at an advanced level will remain an indispensable skill. Avoiding miscommunication and fostering understanding between diverse populations will be critical in the 22nd century, particularly as new languages and dialects evolve, and the reliance on remote collaboration due to technological advancements may emphasize the importance of strong communication skills. 3. Collaboration: Collaboration is the ability to work harmoniously within a group and manage interpersonal relationships to accomplish a shared goal. In future societies, one can reasonably assume that individuals will need to coordinate with others, whether it is within diverse and dispersed teams or across language barriers. Integrating artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies into the workforce will also likely require enhanced collaboration skills that facilitate cooperation between humans and machines. 4. Creativity: Creativity is the ability to generate one's thoughts and ideas, think innovatively, and approach problems in an open-minded and unique manner. As the 22nd century brings forth challenges that humans have never faced before, creativity will be an indispensable skill. Furthermore, automation and robotics may take over tasks that require repetitive activities or manual labor, elevating the significance of creative and innovative aptitudes in the remaining human workforce. While it is impossible to predict the future landscape of education and work with absolute certainty, we can infer that the 4 Cs will continue to hold considerable importance in the 22nd century. The persistent evolution of artificial intelligence, technology, globalization, and cultural dynamics will likely amplify the necessity of these skills. However, it is also possible that new, unforeseen skills may emerge as vital components of future education and work. In any case, focusing on the development of critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity will undoubtedly help prepare individuals for success in the unpredictable world ahead in the 22nd century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is Jino Fort, back again, and I'm going to teach you how to krump stomp. Now krump stomps are not just stomp and stomp all over the floor, going everywhere, because that makes no sense. You'd only look stupid, just looking like a big monkey going out on the dance floor. So basically, krump stomps are [inaudible 0:20]. It's just like jazz, arm swings, and everything else you're supposed to do. It involves precision as well to the beat, and it's not supposed to be the loudest krump stomp either. So don't think if you stomp loud that you're doing it right. A lot of people get that confused. BOOM, they look crazy after that. No, it ends right there.            But basically when you krump stomp it's supposed to be precise. At least have precision and don't stomp too loud, like make an effect, but like have it precise too. Like you're going to stomp, stop it at your heel, or your toe. So you can do another move that's very clean after that as well. You don't want to look crazy, stomping real hard trying to look all nice to get attention and then not have anything to do after that.            So when you do it, kind of like set stance, go to your toe, go on your heel, use your right, you can go all the way around, hit, hit, hit. Hit, hit, hit, hit, have a combination if you will. Let me show you a simple routine highlighting the krump stomp. For your first move you're going to get kind of low, like kind of muscled. You're going to go one, and come up on your toe. Two, now when you drop it you're going to move your toe to the right, so three, four, five, and you're going to do like an arm swing. We're going back to arm swings again, out, so arm swings out. Stomp, is going to be seven.            So let's do that again. Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and make sure you raise that left leg kind of high so you can make it look like you're doing something. Don't just look lazy. You don't want to look lazy, look like you're really into the move and you're doing something with it. So let's try it again. Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, toe, six, seven. Let's try it again, Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six seven. So now let's do it with music. ||||| Us Weekly’s “25 Things You Didn’t Know About Me” feature is usually a space for famous people and non-famous people to just say 25 sentences out loud, but in list form instead of an interview.

It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the \\"Rajasthan Desert\\" and \\"Great Indian Desert\\") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Rajasthan is an economically backward region of India and has the highest percentage of unemployed youth in North India. Rajasthan is divided into 9 regions; Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution. These regions have a parallel history which goes along with that of the state.  - Western India consists of the states of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan along with the Union territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli of India. The region is highly industrialized, with a large urban population. Roughly, Western India is bounded by the Thar Desert in the northwest, the Vindhya Range in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. A major portion of Western India shares the Deccan Plateau with South India. Before the partition of India, the now-Pakistani territories of Sindh and Balochistan were also included in this region.  - Manabendra Nath Roy (21 March 1887  26 January 1954), born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, was an Indian revolutionary, radical activist and political theorist, as well as a noted philosopher in the 20th century. Roy was a founder of the Mexican Communist Party and the Communist Party of India. He was also a delegate to congresses of the Communist International and Russia's aide to China. Following the rise of Joseph Stalin, Roy left the mainline communist movement to pursue an independent radical politics. In 1940 Roy was instrumental in the formation of the Radical Democratic Party, an organisation in which he played a leading role for much of the decade of the 1940s. Roy later moved away from Marxism to become an exponent of the philosophy of radical humanism.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India.

As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

Roy, a pioneer of the Communist movement in India and an advocate of radical democracy. It became an official demand of the Indian National Congress in 1935, and was accepted by the British in August 1940. On 8 August 1940, a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council. This offer, known as the August Offer, included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution. Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946. The members of the Constituent Assembly were elected by the provincial assemblies by a single, transferable-vote system of proportional representation.

It is every bit as good as the rumors - full review to be posted in two parts.  The Why:  When I travel I do it primarily for two things - hockey and food - and when visiting the home of the winningest team in NHL history it only made sense to visit the most well-known restaurant in Montreal...twice...in the same night...sandwiching a game at the Bell Centre.   Owned and operated by Martin Picard Au Pied de Cochon had been on my food bucket list for almost as long as a trip to see Les Habitants for obvious reasons...I just hoped my mother and picky aunt could find something on the menu they'd like.   The Reservation:  Having made mention of this above I'll admit the plan was a little convoluted, but it worked out perfectly - one reservation at 5:00pm for appetizers and entrees, a second reservation at 10:30pm for dessert, coffee, and maybe more.  I knew we'd overeat.  I was okay with this.  The Space:  Located on what is essentially a side street amongst other stores and eateries the wooded exterior of APdC is quite unassuming and arriving early parking was a cinch.  With doors unlocked we were the first to arrive and given our choice of seats we opted for a spot up front near the window of the long and narrow space.  Wooden and rustic with an open kitchen spanning nearly the entirety of the space up to a long bar in back the only thing \\"formal\\" about the space is the linen napkins and stemware - the rest feels like a cozy cabin and a tribute to many things Canadian.    The Service:  Superlative.  From watching Chef Picard himself haul in a large case of Foie Gras and innumerable loaves of bread before stopping by to say hello to our primary server, a young blonde woman, everyone just seemed happy to be at Au Pied de Cochon - an atmosphere that was entirely in harmony with the food and extended from front of the house to the back both at 5:00pm and again at 10:30.  With both the standard menu and a list of eight specials described at length and our time constraints noted with regard to preparation and presentation  it would be hard to ask for better service than what we received at APdC - it was Michelin Star quality.  The Food:  Complimentary Bread and Butter, House Muddled Strawberry Lemonade, Six Appetizers, Two Entrees, Three Desserts, and Coffee.  Fresh Bread with House butter:  I have no idea where Picard gets his bread but they bring it in by the bushel and served up warm with unsalted butter the only challenge was not to eat too much.  A crusty French baguette with good crunch and better chew plus a bit of salinity juxtaposing yeasty notes this was as good as much of the bread service in Paris.  Foie gras cromesquis:  Think of these as liquid foie gras nuggets.  Order them.  Eat them.  Bask in the gluttony.  Tomato Tart:  Knowing my aunt would struggle with the meat-centric menu I also knew this would be right up her ally and as much as it may seem odd to order such a thing at Au Pied de Cochon I would strongly recommend it.  Essentially nothing more than a buttery puff pastry topped with herbs, olive oil, a bit of gruyere, and incredibly fresh tomatoes the tart was acidic and bright yet creamy and balanced plus big enough to share and probably enough to serve as a meal for some.  French Onion Soup:  Another order fitting my aunt's palate, though certainly not traditional, was this pork and lard based French Onion soup. Generally not a fan of the classic form of this dish I think I actually enjoyed this dish the most of anyone at the table as the swine based broth was thick and full - almost like that of ramen - with plenty of fatty pork and root vegetables beneath the bubbling dome of cheese.  Great on its own and more-so when used for dipping bread this is another great choice for those not wanting one of the more substantial plates on Picard's menu.   \\"The Monte Cristo:\\" One of the daily specials I somehow talked my mother into ordering this and although she was hesitant it ended up being a hit with everyone at the table.  Limited to only \\"about a dozen\\" sandwiches that evening and featuring thick maple-custard dredged brioche French toast topped with imported jambon, local turkey, and a blend of Gruyere and Comte plus spreads of guinea hen liver mousse, maple butter, apple jelly, and caramelized onions there was really no part of the palate that this enormous \\"appetizer\\" did not touch on and with a drizzle of maple syrup to finish the plate the biggest shock was that every flavor came through with aplomb.  Certainly gluttonous but entirely delicious this and what followed certainly displayed Picard's propensity for 'shock n' awe' cuisine but honestly, it works.  ...to be continued. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Oliver Leaman in particularly interested in this philosophy, which includes the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka. A:","output":"Oliver Leaman is a well-known scholar and philosopher who is particularly interested in the study of Islamic, Jewish, and Oriental philosophies. Among his areas of interest is the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka, which is predominantly influenced by Theravada Buddhism and elements of traditional Sri Lankan culture. Theravada Buddhism, also known as \\"The Doctrine of the Elders,\\" is an ancient school of Buddhism and the dominant form of the belief system in countries like Sri Lanka, Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. This school of thought stands out due to its emphasis on the Pali Canon, a comprehensive collection of sacred texts that serve as the primary source of knowledge for Theravada Buddhism. One of the key philosophical points in Theravada Buddhism is the understanding and realization of the Four Noble Truths. The first truth, \\"dukkha,\\" refers to the existence of suffering or unsatisfactoriness in life. The second, \\"samudaya,\\" is the acknowledgment of the causes of suffering, which are essentially rooted in desire, craving, and ignorance. The third truth, \\"nirodha,\\" recognizes that suffering can be brought to an end through the cessation of these causes, and the fourth truth, \\"magga,\\" presents the Eightfold Path as the way to achieve the cessation of suffering (enlightenment or Nirvana). The Eightfold Path consists of a set of ethical, mental, and contemplative practices meant to guide individuals toward understanding reality and attaining enlightenment. These practices are organized into three main areas: morality (sila), concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (pañña). Followers are encouraged to cultivate these virtues to overcome cravings, desire, and aversion, which are associated with dukkha. Sri Lankan philosophy also places a strong emphasis on the importance of meditation and mindfulness practices. There are various styles of meditation prominent in the tradition, including Vipassana (insight) meditation, Samatha (concentration) meditation, and Metta (loving-kindness) meditation. The goal of these practices is to develop both clarity of thought and the direct experience of ultimate truths. In addition to meditation practices and the focus on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, Theravada Buddhism also teaches the doctrine of ‘anicca,' or impermanence. This concept refers to the transient nature of existence, as every aspect of life is subject to change, decay, and cessation. By understanding impermanence, practitioners can develop the ability to let go of attachments and aversions that obstruct the path to enlightenment. Sri Lanka also has a rich philosophical tradition linked to its history, political and socio-cultural evolution. The development of a unique Sri Lankan identity was greatly influenced by interactions with Indian, Southeast Asian, and European philosophies and religions over the centuries. As a result, Sri Lankan philosophical thought is characterized by a blend of indigenous wisdom, Theravada Buddhist principles, and a diverse assortment of external cultural and philosophical influences. In summary, Oliver Leaman's interest in the philosophy dominant in Sri Lanka is centered on Theravada Buddhism and the unique cultural amalgamation that has shaped Sri Lankan thought. Key philosophical concepts such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, meditation and mindfulness practices, and the doctrines of impermanence and non-attachment are integral to this rich and diverse school of thought. Studying Sri Lankan philosophy enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural factors that have contributed to the development of its unique perspective on the nature of reality, ethics, and the path to enlightenment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: -  The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process in a viral infection is the attachment of the virus to the target cell. This is a crucial stage, as it facilitates the entry of the virus into the host cell and lays the foundation for the subsequent steps in the infection process. In this step, the virus seeks out and binds to specific receptors on the surface of the target cell using its surface proteins or glycoproteins. Viruses typically have a high degree of specificity for their host cells, meaning they will only infect certain types of cells within an organism. This specificity is determined by the interaction between the virus's surface proteins and the receptor molecules on the host cell membrane. The receptors on the host cell are usually proteins or glycoproteins which play other essential roles in the cell's physiological processes, such as cell signaling, immune response, or intercellular communication. However, viruses have evolved to take advantage of these molecules as a means of entry into the cell. The binding between the viral surface protein and the host cell receptor is governed by molecular recognition, with a \\"lock-and-key\\" mechanism: the shape and chemical properties of the viral protein and host receptor complement each other, allowing them to fit together. This specific interaction ensures that the virus only infects appropriate host cells and minimizes the chances of the virus binding to non-susceptible cells or organisms. Once the virus has firmly attached to the host cell receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that triggers the subsequent steps in the infection process. These steps include the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and the internalization of the virus into the host cell, either through endocytosis or by direct penetration. In summary, the first step of the viral infection process is the attachment of the virus to the target cell via specific interactions between the viral surface proteins and the host cell receptors. This attachment initiates the chain of events that ultimately lead to the replication of the virus, cellular damage, and the onset of illness in the host organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Beer: The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as \\"mashing\\". Hot water (known as \\"liquor\\" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as \\"grist\\") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as \\"sparging\\". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Martin Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949, and was raised in Levittown, New York in the town of Oyster Bay. In 1963 when zip codes were assigned, the section of Levittown in Oyster Bay was given a Hicksville, New York zip code and has since been part of Hicksville. Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of a merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. In 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, Streetlife Serenade. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from the New York neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant; Troy would soon be replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth. Streetlife Serenade contains references to suburbia and the inner city. It is perhaps best known for \\"The Entertainer\\", a No. 34 hit in the US. Upset that \\"Piano Man\\" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote \\"The Entertainer\\" as a sarcastic response: \\"If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.\\" Although Streetlife Serenade is often considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs \\"Los Angelenos\\" and \\"Root Beer Rag\\", an instrumental that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.  In late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll all-star album.  Disenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded Turnstiles, the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the Billy Joel Band. Produced by James William Guercio (then Chicago's producer), Turnstiles was first recorded at Caribou Ranch with members of Elton John's band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.  \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" was a minor hit; Ronnie Spector recorded a cover as did Nigel Olsson, then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \\"shreds\\" his vocal cords; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2014. Though never released as a single, \\"New York State of Mind\\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett have each recorded covers (Bennett's a duet with Joel on Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues). Other notable songs from the album include \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\", \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit), and \\"Prelude/Angry Young Man\\", a concert mainstay. was it successful?","output":"Yes, it was successful. There were songs from the albums that became well-known and loved by many people. For example, \\"The Entertainer\\" was a hit, and \\"New York State of Mind\\" became a very famous song, even though it was never a single. Also, famous singers like Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett recorded covers of those songs.

Options: a ) 70 , b ) 50 , c ) 60 , d ) 80 , e ) 65 Student:","output":"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps: 1. Determine the price of oil before the reduction 2. Calculate the reduced price of oil 3. Find the new quantity of oil the housewife can buy for Rs. 700 4. Calculate the reduced price per kg of oil Step 1: Determine the price of oil before the reduction Let \\"x\\" be the price of oil before the reduction. The housewife is able to buy 3 kgs more after a reduction of 30% in price. This means that the price she is paying for the additional 3 kgs of oil is equal to 30% of the original price. 0.30 * x = 3 * x - 700 Step 2: Calculate the original price of oil Multiplying both sides of the equation by 10/3, we get: x = 700 / 0.10 x = 7,000 / 1 = 7,000 Step 3: Find the new reduced price of oil The reduced price is 70% of the original price (100% - 30%): Reduced price = 0.70 * 7,000 = 4,900 Step 4: Calculate the new quantity of oil the housewife can buy for Rs. 700 Let \\"y\\" be the new quantity of oil: 4,900y = 700 y = 700 / 4,900 y = 1/7 With the reduced price, the housewife can buy 1/7 kg more of oil. Step 5: Calculate the reduced price per kg of oil Now, we know the housewife can buy 3 kgs + 1/7 kg of oil for Rs. 700: Reduced price per kg = 700 / (3 + 1/7) Reduced price per kg = 700 / (22/7) Reduced price per kg = (700 * 7) / 22 Reduced price per kg = 4,900 / 22 Reduced price per kg = Rs. 50 Thus, the correct answer is option 'b', which is 50."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the year 120 AD, the powerful Roman Empire, under the reign of Hadrian, had expanded its rule to the Central Asian countries. During their time of expanding, the great Roman Empire agreed to create an alliance with the Han Dynasty by marrying their two prince and princess, thus uniting the two powers of East and West. However, the Roman prince, Marcus Carprenius (Gavin Stenhouse), did not agree with the decision. Instead, he wants to be free and not be controlled by politics. The Han princess, Meng Li Hua (Jing Lusi), also wants to be free instead being a pawn in a political game. The Roman fleet sails off from the coast of Arabia to the mysterious peninsula dividing the two great kingdoms. The Roman fleet are struck by a powerful storm, which causes the Romans to lose much of their fleet. They go instead to the coast of Goa. They are greeted by a local Goan dealer, (Mano Maniam), and later introduced to Merong Mahawangsa (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), said to be the descendant of Alexander the great himself. Merong is preparing to duel against Sunder (Ravi Sunderlingam), a Goan nobleman who challenged him after Merong had an illicit relationship with the nobleman's sister, YasodharÄ (Deborah Henry). Merong defeats Sunder and Marcus is impressed by Merong's fighting skill. Subsequently, Merong agrees to escort Marcus to the peninsula while Lycius (Eric Karl Henrik Norman), the Roman fleet admiral returns to Rome and promises to return to Goa with a brand new fleet, carrying the payment in gold for the passage of the prince to the Golden Khersonees.

The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Linnaeus published his classification system in the 1700s. Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision.   Choices:  - Bohr  - Newton  - Pasteur  - linnaeus   A: A:","output":"The scientist who created the modern system for classifying organisms is Linnaeus. Carl Linnaeus, also known as Carl von Linné, was a renowned Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist. He excelled in the 18th century and developed a method of naming, classifying, and ranking organisms that is still largely in use — and continually being expanded upon — today. This system of classification is known as the Linnaean taxonomy, which applied a binomial nomenclature to the organism he classified. This system is considered the basis of modern taxonomy. It brought a sense of systematic order to the then chaotic world of biological science. In this system, every species gets a two-part name – the genus it belongs to and a specific epithet. This produced a unique name for every species. For example, the binomial name for a human is Homo sapiens. The paragraph provided also alludes to Linnaeus’s system as it talks about his publication of the classification system in the 1700s and how it elicited a need for revision with the discovery of new species and advancing understandings of biochemistry. This changing nature of scientific understanding and subsequent revision of established systems hint towards the dynamic and evolving nature of scientific truths. However Linnaeus’ revolutionary contribution provided a workable system that has been built upon and refined ever since to accommodate these newer discoveries. Overall, his work on the classification of organisms has had a significant influence on the field of biology, or more specifically, the sub-discipline of taxonomy and systematics. Other scientists listed such as Bohr, Newton, and Pasteur were significant contributors to their respective fields but were not involved in organism classification. Bohr was a physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory. Newton, also a physicist and mathematician, is best known for his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Pasteur was a biologist, microbiologist, and chemist renowned for his work on vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. So, among the options given, Linnaeus is the correct answer as he was the one who indeed developed the modern system for classifying organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe. Ray returns to the bar to get his last paycheck and accidentally kicks Abby's gun, firing it. He finds a motionless Marty and decides to cover up the murder. He cleans up the blood and disposes of evidence in a backyard... Answer:","output":"What is the significance of the cigarette lighter that Visser accidentally leaves behind at the crime scene, and how does it affect the course of events in the movie?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Looks like tree nuts, red wine, and plenty of sleep can all help you stay fit. Researchers found that nut eaters weighed less and had a lower waist circumference and BMI than those who don't eat nuts, the Daily Mail reports. The snacks may also help fight heart disease. Meanwhile, scientists have spotted a compound in red wine that battles obesity by slowing the growth of fat cells. The compound, piceatannol, may also fight neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, the Mail notes. Sleep habits can also have an effect on your weight: Research subjects who got less than five and a half hours burned some 120 fewer calories a day, leading to a 12.5 pound weight gain over a year. (Another study finds that those who sleep less also consume more calories.) Lastly, some news for diet soda fanatics: What you eat is apparently more important than what you drink. Some 32% of diet soda drinkers who ate a \\"Western\\" diet of meats, fried food, and sugars developed metabolic syndrome over two decades, compared to 20% of diet soda fans who ate a \\"prudent\\" diet of fruits and veggies, fish, and whole grains. The lowest risk, at 17.8%? Those who followed a \\"prudent\\" diet and drank no soda, NPR reports. Expand this summary.","output":"A variety of research findings offer new insights into maintaining a healthy weight, with tree nuts, red wine, proper sleep, and a balanced diet being key factors.  Firstly, tree nuts consumption has been linked with numerous health benefits. Research has shown that individuals who regularly consume tree nuts tend to weigh less, have a smaller waist circumference, and possess a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to those who do not eat nuts. The presence of nutrients and antioxidants in nuts contributes to the decreased risk of heart diseases, making them an advantageous addition to one's diet.  In addition to nuts, red wine has also been found to assist in maintaining a healthy weight. Scientists have discovered piceatannol, a compound present in red wine, that aids in combating obesity by reducing the growth of fat cells. Besides its positive effects on weight management, piceatannol also offers protection against cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, further signifying the importance of moderate red wine consumption.  Sleep is another crucial factor that can impact one's weight. Studies have shown that individuals who sleep for less than five and a half hours tend to burn approximately 120 fewer calories per day than those who sleep more, which could lead to a weight gain of 12.5 pounds in a year. Moreover, people who get insufficient sleep often consume more calories than those who enjoy a full night's rest.  Lastly, diet soda consumption has been linked with varied health outcomes, depending on one's food habits. Research has found that 32% of diet soda drinkers who consumed a \\"Western\\" diet, consisting of meats, fried foods, and sugars, developed metabolic syndrome over 20 years. However, only 20% of diet soda consumers who followed a \\"prudent\\" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains experienced the same outcomes. The lowest risk rate of 17.8% was observed in those who adhered to a prudent diet without any soda intake.  In summary, incorporating tree nuts and red wine into a balanced diet, maintaining healthy sleep habits, and reducing or eliminating soda consumption can all contribute to better weight management and overall health. These findings emphasize the importance of making conscious lifestyle choices in order to promote long-term well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"Tradition ascribes authorship of the book to Isaiah son of Amoz , but now scholars widely agree that the book is the work of three different authors - few scholars deny this view, and those that do, do so for theological reasons.\\" be a reasonable answer? Available choices: A). No; B). Yes; A:","output":"A). No; While your description of the multiple authors of the book of Isaiah and the reasons for disagreement among scholars is accurate, it does not directly address the meaning of the specific verses mentioned, Isaiah 55:8-9. To provide a more detailed and thorough answer, one should examine the context and content of these verses. Isaiah 55:8-9 states: \\"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\\" These verses contrast the ways and thoughts of God with those of humans. The Lord's thoughts and ways are different from – and higher than – that of human beings. This distinction expresses the transcendent nature of God and demonstrates His incomprehensible wisdom and knowledge. In the context of the book of Isaiah, these verses serve to remind the people of Israel that God's ways are ultimately beyond human understanding, and therefore, they should trust and rely on Him in times of hardship, deliverance, and prophecy. A more detailed answer to the question about the meaning of these verses should include the context and content of Isaiah 55:8-9, relating to the distinction between God's thoughts and ways compared to those of humans. Additionally, including the information about the authorship and scholarly debate as supplementary context to the overall understanding of the book of Isaiah would provide a well-rounded answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does volume mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"In both sentences, the term \\"volume\\" refers to the level of sound or loudness produced by an audio source, in this case, the stereo system and the music played by the kids. However, the context in which the term is used is different in each sentence. Let me provide a detailed explanation of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"Please turn down the volume on the stereo.\\" In this sentence, \\"volume\\" refers to the loudness of the audio output from the stereo system. The request is to decrease the level of sound being produced by the stereo. The term \\"volume\\" is used directly concerning a device (the stereo) and its settings. The person making the request is asking for an adjustment to be made on the stereo system to reduce the loudness. In this context, \\"volume\\" carries the idea of control or an adjustable property of the stereo. Sentence 2: \\"The kids played their music at full volume.\\" In this sentence, \\"volume\\" also refers to the loudness of the audio output, but the context has shifted. Instead of being directly related to a device's settings, it is now referring to the intensity with which the music was played by the kids. The term \\"full volume\\" implies that the music is being played at the maximum loudness possible. Although \\"volume\\" refers to the same concept of loudness or sound level, in this case, it is being used to describe the manner in which the kids engaged with their music. The focus is on the kids' experience and the intensity of their chosen activity. In conclusion, although \\"volume\\" refers to the level of sound or loudness in both sentences, the contexts in which the term is being used are different. The first sentence emphasizes the control or adjustment of an audio device, while the second sentence focuses on the intensity and experience of the kids playing their music. Despite these contextual differences, the core meaning of \\"volume\\" as a level of sound remains consistent across both sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This information is confirmed by the statement: \\"It is mostly used for general aviation but is also served by one commercial airline.\\" The airport, located near Staunton, Virginia, primarily caters to general aviation, which may include private aircraft, flight training, and other non-commercial aviation activities. Also mentioned is its participation in the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, a government initiative aimed at ensuring a minimal level of scheduled air service to smaller, underserved communities. The EAS program subsidizes the operations of the commercial airline serving the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport, making it possible for this single airline to provide scheduled service despite potentially lower passenger demand. Furthermore, airports can have multiple commercial airlines serving different routes and destinations. However, in the case of Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport, given its smaller size and primary focus on general aviation, it has only attracted one commercial airline. Factors influencing this may include the airport's infrastructure, proximity to larger airports, or the surrounding communities' size and travel demands.

Article: What is a six-letter word that immediately comes to mind when you need some information on the Internet? You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products.

Kurt Julian Weill (March 2, 1900 - April 3, 1950) was a German composer, active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States. He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work The Threepenny Opera, which included the ballad \\"Mack the Knife\\". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In 1922 he joined the Novembergruppe, a group of leftist Berlin artists that included Hanns Eisler and Stefan Wolpe. In February 1924 the conductor Fritz Busch introduced him to the dramatist Georg Kaiser, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in Grunheide, Weill first met singer/actress Lotte Lenya in the summer of 1924. The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (following their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the Kurt Weill Foundation. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide Der deutsche Rundfunk. Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.  Although he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, or the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, Weill tended more and more to vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular with the wider public in Germany at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Weill's music was admired by composers such as Alban Berg, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Darius Milhaud and Stravinsky, but it was also criticised by others: by Schoenberg, who later revised his opinion, and by Anton Webern.  His best-known work is The Threepenny Opera (1928), a reworking of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera written in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. Engel directed the original production of The Threepenny Opera in 1928. It contains Weill's most famous song, \\"Mack the Knife\\" (\\"Die Moritat von Mackie Messer\\"). The stage success was filmed by G. W. Pabst in two language versions: Die 3-Groschen-Oper and L'opera de quat' sous. Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicised lawsuit--which Weill won and Brecht lost. Weill's working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism, after Brecht tried to push the play even further into a left wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to \\"set the communist party manifesto to music.\\" Entity:","output":"This text is about Kurt Julian Weill, a German composer who was active in the 1920s in Germany and later in the United States.

During major international incidents or crises, America has seldom voted against an incumbent president. Translate to Russian","output":"Во время крупных международных инцидентов или кризисов, Америка редко голосовала против действующего президента. В ходе значительных международных происшествий или кризисных ситуаций, которые имели место в мировой политике, Соединенные Штаты Америки во многих случаях продемонстрировали склонность к поддержке своего действующего президента. Этот фактор обуславливается тем, что в сложные периоды население страны ожидает от своего главы государства решительных действий и определенной стратегии для стабилизации ситуации.  Верность нации своему президенту может объясняться также необходимостью демонстрации солидарности и сплоченности перед лицом общей, зачастую внешней угрозы. Подобна реакция заложена в основе человеческой природы и взаимодействия между представителями социума. Соединенные Штаты Америки, как мировая сверхдержава, находятся на виду более чем в одном случае международных разногласий или чрезвычайных обстоятельств, что способствует активному процессу формирования общественного мнения в пользу действующего президента и его администрации.

Иными словами, если действующий президент уже позитивно зарекомендовал себя в решении предыдущих кризисов или внутриполитических проблем, вероятность того что он получит доверие народа возрастает.  Резюмируя, можно сказать, что причинами поддержки американского народа в случае крупных международных инцидентов или кризисов являются следующие факторы: необходимость выработки совместной стратегии, стремление к солидарности перед возникающими угрозами, оценка предыдущих достижений и неудач действующего президента.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. [a]. Soak the lid in hot water for a few minutes.. [b]. Soak the lid in cold water for a few minutes..","output":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning is [a]. Soak the lid in hot water for a few minutes. There are several reasons why this solution is more effective for taking off a stuck jar lid compared to soaking the lid in cold water: 1. Thermal expansion: When you soak the lid in hot water, the metal or plastic material of the lid will undergo thermal expansion. This means that the material will expand slightly due to the heat. Research has shown that molecules of most substances move faster and spread out when heated. When the lid expands, the tightness of its grip on the jar decreases, which should make it easier to twist off. 2. Reduction of air pressure: If the contents of the jar were hot when the jar was sealed, the air inside the jar may have experienced some cooling when the contents settled. This can create a vacuum as the air pressure inside the jar is lower than the outside air pressure. By soaking the lid in hot water, the air pressure inside the jar will increase as the temperature rises, equalizing the pressure and making it easier to remove the lid. 3. Softening of any residue: Sometimes a stuck jar lid can be due to food residue or a sticky substance creating a bond between the lid and the jar. In this case, soaking the lid in hot water can soften the residue, making it easier to loosen and twist off the lid. 4. Increased grip on the lid: The process of holding the jar under hot water will also warm your hands. This can potentially improve your grip on the lid, making it easier to twist off. When your hands are cold and wet from cold water, your grip may be compromised and it would be harder to generate the necessary torque to loosen the jar lid. In summary, the naive physics reasoning suggests that soaking the jar lid in hot water for a few minutes is the more effective solution for removing a stuck jar lid. Not only does it allow for the expansion of the lid material, but it also helps balance the air pressure inside and outside the jar, softens any residue sticking the lid to the jar, and potentially improves grip."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the 40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond. Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie (GÃ©nesis RodrÃ­guez), break into Englander's vault across the street, to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them but do not find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him, stealing the diamond at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room. Lydia does not trust him, and Dougherty backs her up. Ackerman claims he has found bomb schematics in a storage unit Nick rented and is convinced that he will detonate an explosive...

Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration.

Article:Minutes of a meeting in 1985 show Leon Brittan then home secretary, wanted to avoid \\"any form of enquiry\\" into policing of the picket lines. Miners say the files show successive governments \\"never wanted the truth to come out\\" over the events. But the Home Office said there were few lessons to be learnt from 30 years ago. Eighteen new files have been released to the National Archive, after current Home Secretary Amber Rudd promised that 30 previously unreleased files connected with the strike would be published. Ex-miner Frank Arrowsmith, who was on the picket line during the year long strike, said \\"the suspicion is never going to go away that those in Number 10 and the Home Secretary decided to use the police as a battering ram to defeat the miners\\". \\"If a government can get away with burying this you're thinking what's next? But given what they've released so far, I don't think we're going to go away, we are one day going to hold them to account,\\" he added. The documents do not show evidence to support the claim made by some miners that ministers in the Thatcher government were directly controlling the operational tactics of police forces. But Nicholas Jones, who covered the strike as the BBC's industrial correspondent, said: \\"These documents really open the window on what the government and the police were thinking in 1985. \\"There is no sign of any feeling of remorse in these files, in fact the police are quite dismissive about the event\\". The files were released after Ms Rudd ruled out holding an inquiry into the so-called Battle of Orgreave.. In June 1984 thousands of police and striking miners clashed violently at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire. South Yorkshire Police has been criticised for how they conducted themselves during the incident, and it has been claimed the force used the same tactics on the Liverpool fans in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. \\"I find it worrying that there were immediate efforts from the very top of government to shut down any enquiry into the miners strike\\", said Labour MP Andy Burnham who has campaigned on behalf the Hillsborough families. \\"The events at Orgreave and Hillsborough can't be separated. We can't have the full truth about Hillsborough until we also know what happened four years earlier\\". There are 15 Home Office files still to be passed to be the National Archive, and its understood the South Yorkshire force is yet to publish 65 files connected with its actions during the strike. A Home Office spokesman said: \\"The Home Secretary's decision that there will no inquiry into the events at Orgreave  was made after careful consideration of the key purposes of an inquiry and, critically, taking into account how the policing landscape has changed fundamentally since 1984 at all levels. \\"There would be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article is about some important papers from a long time ago. These papers are about a big fight that happened in 1984 between some miners and police officers. The people in charge of the country at the time didn't want anyone to look into this fight too much. Some people think that the people in charge told the police to be mean to the miners. Even though the papers don't show this, they do show that the people in charge knew about the fight and didn't want to do anything about it.  Some people now want to know more about what happened, because they think it might be connected to another problem that happened later, during a football game. But other people say that we don't need to look into this since it was a very long time ago and things have changed a lot since then."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Subglacial Volcanic Eruption in Iceland Could Reach the Atmosphere Updated Sunday, August 24 at 10:00 a.m. A subglacial eruption is underway at Iceland’s Bardarbunga volcano, where there have been thousands of earthquakes in the past week, Iceland’s Meteorological Office said Saturday. Seismic data suggests that volcanic lava is melting ice beneath the Vatnajokull glacier, said seismic vulcanologist Melissa Pfeffer, Reuters reports. It’s unclear whether the eruption will break through the ice and shoot steam and ash into the atmosphere. The amount of ash produced in a larger eruption would depend on how thick the ice is, Pfeffer said, with thicker ice likely to cause a more explosive and ash-rich eruption. On Sunday, Iceland lowered its aviation alert level to orange from red, saying there is no sign of an eruption at the Bardarbunga volcano. Iceland had said the day before that an eruption could cause “significant emission of ash into the atmosphere” and set its alert level for the volcano to the highest degree, red. Ash clouds can cause a massive headache for international airlines, as aircraft have to be rerouted to avoid them. More than 100,000 flights were cancelled in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallajokul, an Icelandic volcano that produced a cloud so large it obstructed air travel.

Write a summary based on this article: Adrian Wojnarowski explains how moving to L.A. could benefit LeBron James off the hardwood and how it will help the Lakers' recruiting strategy. (1:33)      LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James' next NBA chapter will be set on the West Coast.      James will be playing for the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, 153.3 million contract. He will try to bring the storied franchise another championship.      The announcement was made through his agency, Klutch Sports Group, which announced the deal as 154 million.      ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported that the fourth year is a player option. It is the longest deal James has signed since inking a six-year contract with the Miami Heat in 2010. His previous three deals were three years or shorter.      James leaves his hometown team as a free agent for the second time in his career. Four years ago, James had stated his intention to finish his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Whether the four-time MVP and 14-time All-Star does that or not, he certainly has left his mark on his city.      James, 33, thanked his home area in an Instagram story. He wrote in text overlaying a photo from the Cavaliers' 2016 NBA title victory parade, \\"Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home.\\"      He delivered the first championship to the sports-obsessed city in 52 years and did so with storybook gusto, helping the Cavaliers become the first team in NBA Finals history to rally from a 3-1 series deficit to win it all. The team he took down, the Golden State Warriors, had the best regular-season record in league history, at 73-9.      \\"Words do not express the meaning and the feeling this accomplishment brought to the people of Northeast Ohio,\\" Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said in a lengthy statement thanking James. \\"None of this would have happened if LeBron James did not agree to come back home and lead the Cavaliers to the promised land.      \\"LeBron is a family man, first. We wish his kids, his wife, Savannah, his mother, Gloria, and LeBron himself nothing but the best in the years and decades ahead. LeBron's connection to Akron, Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio will most certainly endure as his commitment to the region and his support of many important causes has been impactful to so many kids and families.      \\"LeBron, you came home and delivered the ultimate goal. Nothing but appreciation and gratitude for everything you put into every moment you spent in a Cavaliers uniform. We look forward to the retirement of the famous #23 Cavs jersey one day down the line ...\\"      James leaves the Cavaliers franchise as its leader in nearly every major statistical category: games played, points, rebounds, assists and steals.      If 2017-18 was his final act in Cleveland, what a show he put on -- playing in all 82 games for the first time in his 15-year career and capping it off with a postseason performance as dominant as any playoff run James has ever been part of.      play 1:54 Windhorst says L.A. was the desired location for LeBron Brian Windhorst details how LeBron James came to his decision to leave the Cavaliers for the Lakers.      James becomes the first player in NBA history to lead a postseason in scoring and switch teams the following offseason.      He joins the illustrious list of NBA legends to play for the Lakers, some of whom have already welcomed James to the family.      I am sure the Lakernation is rejoicing The acquisition of LeBron James means that the Lakers are just a smidgen away from being real contenders. Congrats to @MagicJohnson & @LALakersLive et al. Cross your fingers for news from San Antonio. — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (@kaj33) July 2, 2018      NBA players past and present reacted on Twitter too.      James' agent, Rich Paul, called Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson minutes before he sent the announcement tweet, a source told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. Paul then called Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman as soon as he got off the phone with Johnson.      Then the tweet was sent.      The Lakers, after failing to get a meeting with free-agent target Paul George prior to George's announcement that he would re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder, have secured free agency's most coveted player.      In the franchise's biggest free-agent splash since Shaquille O'Neal became a Laker in the summer of 1996, Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka have delivered a major piece of the plan they plotted when they joined the Lakers in February 2017. Johnson took the job largely to restore the franchise's glorious past and recruit elite superstars to Los Angeles -- something the franchise had struggled with in recent years. James joins the league's second-youngest team when weighted by playing time from last season. The Lakers have an up-and-coming young core of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart.      Top 8 Scorers Points A Laker? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 38,387 Yes Karl Malone 36,928 Yes Kobe Bryant 33,643 Yes Michael Jordan 32,292 No Wilt Chamberlain 31,419 Yes Dirk Nowitzki 31,187 No LeBron James 31,038 Yes Shaquille O'Neal 28,596 Yes      Which of the Lakers' young prospects will stay to play alongside James remains to be seen. The Lakers have been trying to acquire Kawhi Leonard, who reportedly is unhappy with the San Antonio Spurs and would prefer to play for the Lakers. The Spurs would surely want as many prospects and assets as possible from the Lakers in exchange for the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.      A source told Shelburne that the Lakers felt a sense of urgency this week to find a co-star to play alongside James, either through free agency with George or through a trade for Leonard. Johnson went to one of James' houses in Los Angeles late Saturday night and met with him for several hours, sources told Shelburne. However, when Johnson spoke to James and James' camp at the opening of free agency, James assured the Lakers that this was a long-term play for him and his decision wouldn't be affected by a single transaction the Lakers could make under time pressure.      James made it clear that this latest NBA-altering decision would be made with his family in mind. James has two homes in Los Angeles, where his off-the-court business interests can thrive.      Johnson and Pelinka will continue to work to surround James with more talent in order to challenge the Warriors and Houston Rockets in the Western Conference. But Johnson has landed the biggest fish he was trying to catch.      Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss said she had ultimate faith in Johnson and Pelinka, but she also said last week that she wants to see the Lakers, who went 35-47 last season, return to the postseason for the first time since 2012-13.      Johnson said last week that if he failed to add stars to the Lakers by next summer, he would step down from his job.      That is moot with the team landing James.      play 3:23 LeBron chooses Lakers for next chapter Mark Schwarz breaks down LeBron James' path to the Lakers, with whom he will continue to chase Michael Jordan's GOAT title and the dynasty of the Dubs.      \\"No pressure on me,\\" Johnson said last week when asked if he felt urgency to add a star in this free agency. \\"I am going to do my job. I have always done that. ... Do you know how many Finals I have been in [as a player]? So you think I am worried about this? I have played against Larry Bird in the Finals. I mean, come on, man. I have been in nine Finals. I have been in college NCAA championships.\\"      When told that this is a different job than being the point guard who orchestrated the Lakers' \\"Showtime\\" dynasty, Johnson reminded people of who he is.      \\"I'm Magic Johnson. I am still the same dude,\\" he said. \\"I am not going to change. No pressure on me. I am going to do my job. That's what I do. I do my job. I'm excited. It's fun. I am looking forward to it.\\"      And enjoying it.      ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this report. ||||| LeBron James is on the move once again.      Bringing an end to months (and for some fans, years) of speculation, James announced through his agent on Sunday that he is ending his second stint as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Los Angeles Lakers for the upcoming NBA season.      “LeBron James, four time NBA MVP, three time NBA finals MVP, fourteen time NBA All Star, and two time Olympic gold medalist has agreed to a four year, 154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers,” reads a press release tweeted by Klutch Sports Group, James’ agency, on Sunday.      It was widely thought that James, who turns 34 in December, would leave Cleveland for a team on the verge of championship contention, or a franchise with the flexibility to create one. Doing so would not only give the athlete a chance at a ninth NBA finals appearance but would likely lead him to another match-up against back-to-back NBA champion Golden State Warriors.      (The warriors have faced James four consecutive times for the Larry O’Brien trophy, winning three of the match-ups.)      But James’ decision wasn’t cut-and-dry from the start, as several teams — barring some trades or free agency signings — were in solid position to sign the star, including the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers and the Cavaliers.      Since the 2018 NBA Finals ended in an embarrassing sweep of the Cavaliers by the Warriors, James has said that his next move would come down to what he felt was best for his children — Bryce Maximus James, 10, LeBron James Jr., 13, and Zhuri James, 3 — and his wife, Savannah Brinson.      Although James has kept mum about any preferences, that hasn’t stopped NBA analysts and fans from speculating where he’d end up. Discussions about which team is the favorite to land the superstar have changed from week to week.      Jason Miller/Getty      RELATED: ‘Worst Play in NBA Finals History?’ Twitter (and LeBron James) React to JR Smith’s Epic Fail      Initially, many believed that James would switch conferences from the East to the West to sign with the Rockets, joining all-stars Chris Paul and James Harden. The Rockets held a 3-2 series lead over the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals before Paul suffered a hamstring injury, which allowed the Warriors to take the series in seven games.      The Sixers also seemed to be a good fit, as James would likely be able to reach the finals once again with young stars like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.      But the tide appeared to turn in the Lakers’ favor in early June when NBA legend Gary Payton said in an interview that LeBron James Jr. had signed up to attend an LA-area school for eighth grade.      Then, Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs allegedly demanded a trade, saying he preferred to be sent to the Lakers for the upcoming season, according to ESPN. This fueled rumors that James, Leonard, and free agent Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder were planning to create a super team in Los Angeles to rival the Warriors. George signed a contract with Oklahoma City as soon as free agency began.      Because Leonard cannot opt out of his contract until next summer, he hasn’t had much say in where he’ll go. And the Spurs have been reluctant to trade their best player to another team in the Western Conference. Still, without another big-time player heading to the LA team, many were unsure whether James would pick the Lakers after all.      Now that he has made his choice known, the rest of the NBA can plan their next moves.      RELATED: LeBron James Explains New Pair of ‘Equality’ Shoes      This isn’t the first time James has sent shockwaves through the NBA as a free agent.      In a controversial move, now known as “The Decision,” James took to ESPN for a televised interview in 2010 where he announced he was leaving Cleveland and “taking [his] talents to South Beach” to join Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat.      Many criticized James’ decision and denounced the dramatic announcement. Thus, the phrase “taking my talents” quickly became a meme. At the start of his first season in Miami, James expressed slight regret about how he went about breaking the news.      “If I had to go back on it, I probably would do it a little bit different”, James told the New York Times. “But I’m happy with my decision.”      He would go on to win two consecutive championships with the Heat in 2012 and 2013.      But James would surprise the basketball world once again in 2014 when he announced that he was rejoining the Cavaliers in a Sports Illustrated article titled “I’m Coming Home.” This time, the announcement was well-received by many (except Heat fans, of course).      Beck Diefenbach/AFP/Getty Images      Though James — who was born a short ways from Cleveland in Akron, Ohio — is leaving the team once again, during his four years back, he helped to give something to the city they never had before: an NBA championship.      Along with point guard Kyrie Irving, James led the Cavs to a thrilling Game 7 victory over the Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals. It was the first professional sports title for Cleveland in over half-a-century, and, though his time with the team is over (for now?), for the city, those memories will certainly last a lifetime. ||||| Summary:","output":"LeBron James will leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second time in his career to join the Los Angeles Lakers on a four-year, 153.3 million contract.

He had a bit of a scream then he got off and the other kids jumped on and off we went,' she told the Bulletin. 'There was one family that decided they wanted to ring the police and they hunted me down and handcuffed me in front of everyone.' In Southport Magistrates Court, Prosecutor Ben Fotheringham told the court Ms Radatti spun the playground ride and caused the child to scream for help, adding that he was 'incredibly distressed' by being spun around fast. Ms Radatti's solicitor said the Burleigh Waters woman was 'heavily intoxicated' at the time but that the matter did not involve violence. Ms Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at Justins Park in Burleigh on the Gold Coast. 'This is possibly what could best be described as poor decision making, but no other parents were opposed to this,' he said. Magistrate Dermot Kehoe said Ms Radatti had risked injuring the four-year-old boy, and that she should not have been playing with strangers' children. Court documents show Ms Radatti has a criminal history dating back to 2005. She was convicted of a number of other offences including assault occasioning bodily harm, assaulting or obstructing a police officer, breaching probation and bail conditions, and other public nuisance offences. In Southport Magistrates Court she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole.

Article: Sugar--free beets that still taste sweet, tastier tomatoes and brighter-colored fruits and vegetables that stay ripe longer are all foods that are being grown now. How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster. People have different opinions about genetic engineering. One side supports it and thinks it will only help us. The other side is opposed to playing with nature and fears... Question: In general, who does not support the idea of genetic food? Answer: The answer is:","output":"In general, people who do not support the idea of genetically engineered food are those who have concerns regarding potential health risks, such as allergies, and those who are opposed to interfering with nature.

Providing them with a comfortable and engaging environment is the key to ensuring their happiness and well-being. In this article, we will discuss some essential tips to make their cages a stimulating and comfortable habitat for your feathered friend. 1. Make sure their cage is large enough: One of the most important factors in choosing a cage for your pet bird is ensuring that it is spacious enough for them to move around freely and spread their wings. A large cage will not only be critical to their physical well-being but will also help in addressing issues such as stress or boredom. To determine the appropriate cage size, take into account the bird's size, species, and the number of birds you plan to house. Remember to consider the extra space required for perches, toys, and other accessories. 2. Place the cage in an active area of your home: Birds are social creatures that thrive on interaction and stimulation. Placing their cage in an active area of your home, such as the living room or family room, will help them feel more connected with you and your family members. This will prevent feelings of isolation and loneliness while providing the necessary mental stimulation. However, take care to avoid direct sunlight and drafts, as well as areas with constant loud noises or too much foot traffic. 3. Add a variety of perches to encourage flight: Including different types and sizes of perches in your bird's cage will encourage them to fly from one to another, promoting exercise and improving their overall health. Providing a variety of perches made from different materials, such as wood, rope, or plastic, is also essential for maintaining their foot health and preventing foot injuries. Ensure each perch is the appropriate size for your bird's species and securely attached to the cage. 4. Put a few toys inside their cage: Toys play a vital role in providing mental stimulation and entertainment for your pet bird. They also help to alleviate boredom, which can lead to behavioral issues such as excessive noise-making or self-harming. Add a variety of toys, such as those designed for chewing, foraging, or climbing, and be sure to rotate them regularly to maintain your bird's interest. Always ensure that any toys are size-appropriate for your bird and are made from safe materials. 5. Set a bath inside of their cage: Providing your pet bird with a bath inside their cage offers several benefits. It helps promote healthy feather condition, allows for important preening activities, and offers an opportunity for exercise and play. Ensure the bath is shallow and easy for your bird to access, with a non-slip surface for their safety. Remember to clean and refill the bath regularly to keep it hygienic for your pet. Conclusion: By following these essential tips, you can offer your pet bird an environment that is both comfortable and stimulating. A well-appointed and spacious cage, coupled with regular social interaction, ensures your feathered friend will lead a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life. Remember, a contented and engaged bird is not only a joy to have around but also a testament to your commitment to their well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

James Caan, an accomplished American actor, rose to fame in the early '60s and continued to have a successful acting career spanning decades. Some of his other notable roles include Sonny Corleone in \\"The Godfather\\" (1972), Paul Sheldon in \\"Misery\\" (1990), and Ed Deline in the television series \\"Las Vegas\\" (2003-2008). In \\"El Dorado\\" specifically, Caan's character Mississippi (full name: Alan Bourdillion Trahern) is a young and somewhat inexperienced gunslinger with a talent for knife throwing. He joins forces with two experienced gunfighters, played by John Wayne (as Cole Thornton) and Robert Mitchum (as Sheriff J.P. Harrah), to defend a ranching family against a crooked land baron in the town of El Dorado. The film focuses on themes of loyalty, friendship, and redemption, and Mississippi's character serves as a central figure who helps bridge the gap between the two older and more experienced gunfighters. Ultimately, James Caan's performance as Mississippi in \\"El Dorado\\" is highly regarded, as the film continues to be a classic in the western genre.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up.

Please answer a question about the following article about Post-punk: Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene.

Let's elaborate on this. Premise: You asked these men and women to help protect your village from the slavery that will soon fall upon them by a large band of murderers most vile. The given premise implies a couple of things: 1. There is a potential threat to the village from a group of dangerous individuals. 2. You believe that the intervention of these men and women will help guard your village against this imminent threat. Hypothesis: You didn't need any help at all. The hypothesis contradicts the premise. If you didn't need any help, then asking the men and women to protect your village wouldn't make sense. It means that you might have either exaggerated or misjudged the severity of the threat, or that you underestimated your own abilities to defend the village. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would have to examine additional information and context: 1. Did the threat to the village materialize as expected? If it turned out that the perceived threat was not as severe as initially thought, then it is possible that you didn't need any help in the end. 2. Were there any other factors or circumstances that were not considered in the premise, such as the availability of different resources or ways to counter the threat that were not initially apparent? 3. Did the men and women who were asked to help turn out to be a hindrance instead of an asset in protecting the village? If so, perhaps you would have been better off without them. Only by analyzing these and other relevant factors can we conclude whether or not the hypothesis is true.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Her Majestys Exchequer or just the Exchequer is a term used in the civil service of the United Kingdom for the accounting process of central government and for the government's \\"current account\\" i.e. money held from taxation and other government revenues in the Consolidated Fund It can be found used in various financial documents including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts.  - The Second Lord of the Treasury is a member of the commission exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom. Since 1827, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always simultaneously held the office of Second Lord of the Treasury when that person has not also been the Prime Minister. The official residence of the Second Lord of The Treasury is 11 Downing Street.  - Her Majesty's Government (HMG), commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  - Downing Street in London, United Kingdom, has for more than three hundred years housed the official residences of two of the most senior British Cabinet ministers: the First Lord of the Treasury, an office now synonymous with that of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; and the Second Lord of the Treasury, an office held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister's official residence is 10 Downing Street; the Chancellor's official residence is next door at Number 11. The government's Chief Whip has an official residence at Number 12, although the current Chief Whip's residence is at Number 9.  - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury. The office is a British Cabinet-level position.  - The Chief Whip is a political office in some legislatures whose task is to administer the whipping system that tries to ensure that members of the party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British politics, the Chief Whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street.  - The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the commission exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom, and is now always also the Prime Minister. This office is not equivalent to the usual position of the \\"Treasurer\\" in other governments; the closer equivalent of a Treasurer in the United Kingdom is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the Second Lord of the Treasury.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. The prime minister (informal abbreviation: PM) and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers, most of whom are government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The office is one of the Great Offices of State. The , Theresa May, leader of the Conservative Party, was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016.  - 10 Downing Street, colloquially known in the United Kingdom as Number 10, is the headquarters of Government of the United Kingdom and the official residence and office of the First Lord of the Treasury, a post which, for much of the 18th and 19th centuries and invariably since 1905, has been held by the Prime Minister.  - The post of Lord High Treasurer or Lord Treasurer was an English government position and has been a British government position since the Acts of Union of 1707. A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State, below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor.  - 11 Downing Street ( commonly known as Number 11 ) , is the official residence of Britain 's Second Lord of the Treasury who is formally recognised as the Chancellor of the Exchequer . The first Chancellor to live there was Henry Petty - Fitzmaurice in 1806 , but Number 11 did not become the Chancellor 's official residence until 1828 .

First, the story was \\"moved outside,\\" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story.  Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ??

I've now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories.

In the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31–3, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38–7, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17–14 against the defending conference champion 1970 Minnesota Vikings season, thus setting up a matchup against the 1970 Dallas Cowboys season for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17–10, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the 1970 Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington (49ers), and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.

We have the math problem: 141 * m = 145 * m - 4 First, let's look at both sides of the equal sign (=). On the left side, we have 141 times some number (m). On the right side, we have 145 times the same number (m) and then subtract 4. We need to find out what number (m) will make both sides equal. Let's work on it together. Step 1: We need to get all the m's on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 141 * m from both sides. New equation: 0 = (145 * m - 141 * m) - 4 Step 2: Now, let's simplify the equation. On the right side, we have 145 * m - 141 * m. Since we are multiplying the same number (m) by two different numbers (145 and 141) and then subtracting, we can write it as (145 - 141) * m. New equation: 0 = (4 * m) - 4 Step 3: We are almost there. Now, let's find the number m. To do this, we need to move the -4 to the left side. We will add 4 to both sides. New equation: 4 = 4 * m Step 4: Lastly, we want to know how many times does 4 multiply itself to get 4 (4 * m = 4).  To find this, we will divide both sides by 4. New equation: 1 = m So, the number m we were looking for is 1!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  a spoon  for the following movie plot:  The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.  The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  When was the water level lower, in April or in March?

Use the following highlights to write an article: Major outlets highlighted PM’s fury, likening him to Fawlty Towers customers. One wrote 'a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu..refusing to pay bill' Another spoke of him 'abandoning traditional English reserve' in his rant.","output":"Title: Prime Minister's Fury Over EU Menu Causes Fawlty Towers Comparison In an unprecedented move that has left the media buzzing, the recent outburst from the Prime Minister during EU negotiations has drawn comparisons to the popular British sitcom, Fawlty Towers. Known for its comedic look at the mishaps of a customer-centric hotel proprietor, Fawlty Towers captured the hearts of viewers both in the UK and abroad. However, the storyline that unfolded in the political arena was no laughing matter. The incident began when the Prime Minister expressed his dissatisfaction with the proposed EU menu, likening it to an unpalatable meal at a poorly-run establishment. Major outlets were quick to draw comparisons between this political standoff and the antics seen on Fawlty Towers, where customers were often left disgruntled by the quality of food and service. One such outlet framed the situation as the Prime Minister being \\"a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu…refusing to pay [the] bill.\\" This analogy suggests that the stronger tone taken by the Prime Minister was a refusal to conform to Europe’s expectations of accepting their proposals without question, just like the customers who refused to pay for unsatisfactory service at the fictional hotel. Another major news platform described the Prime Minister as \\"abandoning traditional English reserve\\" in his impassioned speech. This highlights the shift from the typically polite and measured political discourse to a more direct and emotionally-charged way of communicating dissatisfaction. Fans of Fawlty Towers might recall multiple incidents when the usually reserved protagonist, Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, would lose his temper and engage in verbal altercations with hotel guests. The parallels between the two situations do not end there. Just as Basil Fawlty's frustration with his guests would often spiral out of control, leading to chaos and misunderstandings, the Prime Minister's outburst has caused an uproar among politicians and diplomats alike. The repercussions of this incident are yet to be fully understood, but it has undoubtedly shaken up the way negotiations are conducted in the future. Despite these similarities, it is crucial to remember that the stakes of these two situations are vastly different — the fate of an entire nation as opposed to the goings-on at a small hotel. However, the use of Fawlty Towers as an analogy has helped the public understand and empathize with the Prime Minister's stance. Furthermore, this comparison aids in humanizing the often complex political arena, providing a relatable and easily digestible parallel to the current political narrative. While the sitcom's themes may not have been intended for a political context, the universality of human emotions and the struggle to communicate effectively are timeless, making the comparison apt for describing the situation. In conclusion, the Prime Minister's dissatisfaction over the proposed EU menu sits at an interesting crossroads of politics, popular culture, and human emotion. By comparing the situation to Fawlty Towers, the press has not only made the issue more accessible to the public but also highlighted the importance of effective communication in the world of politics. As negotiations continue, it remains to be seen whether this new approach will yield better results for the parties involved and whether the Prime Minister will continue to channel his inner Basil Fawlty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
