Possible A: enjoy, tasty, health problems, hunger, indigestion  Why is \\"tasty\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Tasty\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses a fundamental aspect of human experience and preferences when it comes to food consumption. In general, people tend to eat food that they find enjoyable and flavorful. This proclivity for seeking out palatable meals and snacks is the result of a combination of factors, including evolution, biology, and individual experiences. From an evolutionary perspective, finding food tasty serves a critical function in encouraging humans to consume the necessary nutrients and energy sources to survive and thrive. When a person finds a particular food, such as a hamburger, tasty, they are more likely to consume it again in the future, which can contribute to their ongoing search for sustenance. Additionally, tastiness also signals that the food is likely safe to eat, as historically, our ancestors often associated bitter or sour tastes with potential toxins or harmful substances. Biologically, the sensation of taste is mediated by the presence of taste receptors on our tongue, which are specialized cells that are responsible for detecting the presence of different molecules in the food we eat. When the taste receptors sense the molecules responsible for giving food its flavor, they relay that information to the brain, which interprets the signal as a subjective perception of taste. In the case of hamburgers, several factors contribute to their tastiness, such as the satisfying umami taste of the meat, the combination of spices and seasonings, and the interplay between textures (e.g., the crunchiness of lettuce, the softness of the bun, and the juicy consistency of the patty). These factors work together to create a pleasurable and memorable eating experience that drives a person to seek out more of that specific food. Additionally, individual experiences and cultural upbringing also play a role in shaping a person's perceptions of tastiness. People raised in environments where hamburgers are a popular and readily available food option might be more likely to enjoy them and crave them than those who grew up without exposure to such meals. Also, the psychological component of comfort brought by familiar tastes and associations with positive memories (e.g., enjoying burgers during family gatherings, celebrations, or social events) can further contribute to the increased appeal of hamburgers. In conclusion, the answer \\"tasty\\" is aligned with human common sense because it addresses the core components of human food preferences, including evolutionary drives, biological processes, individual experiences and cultural factors that shape our perception of the enjoyable flavors in food. Eating hamburgers can be an indulgence that is both satisfying and comforting, and the gratifying taste serves as a powerful motivator for people to continue craving and consuming them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

Step 2: Wash the potato Wash the potato by running it under lukewarm water to remove any dirt or impurities. Gently scrub the surface using your hands or a soft brush. This ensures that your peeled potato will be clean. Step 3: Position the potato on the cutting board Place the clean potato on the cutting board, which will provide a steady surface for peeling. Step 4: Grip the potato and the peeler Hold the potato firmly using your non-dominant hand, keeping your fingers away from the area you will be peeling. Hold the potato peeler or knife securely using your dominant hand. Step 5: Begin peeling Using the potato peeler, place the blade at the top of the potato and apply slight pressure while moving the peeler away from your hand, following the curvature of the potato. If using a knife, follow the same process but be cautious not to remove too much of the potato or cut yourself. Step 6: Rotate and repeat Rotate the potato as needed to peel all sides. Continue peeling until the entire potato has been rid of its skin. Step 7: Inspect for missed spots After you have peeled the entire potato, inspect it for any remaining spots of skin or imperfections and remove them using the peeler or knife as necessary. Step 8: Rinse the peeled potato Once the potato has been fully peeled, rinse it under water to remove any remaining bits of skin or debris. Step 9: Store or use the peeled potato Transfer the peeled potato to the bowl or container, or immediately use it for your desired cooking purposes.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials? , can you please find it?   Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and...

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees.  But I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  What is an answer for this question: Which province experiences more carbon loss? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the southern province likely experiences more carbon loss. This conclusion can be drawn from the various observations regarding the degradation of this province's land. The southern province has been subjected to intensive grazing for many years, which has resulted in poor soil quality and frequent dust storms. Degraded lands, such as the ones in this province, often face a decline in biodiversity and loss of essential nutrients, like water, nitrogen, and carbon. The decrease in biodiversity consequently makes the ecosystem less adaptable to disasters, impacts the available food supply for animals, and contributes to the decline of plant and animal species. As mentioned in the provided background details, the loss of carbon and nitrogen in the Tibetan Plateau led to substantial economic losses. Since the southern province displays many signs of degradation, such as poor soil quality and increased dust storms, it can be assumed that this province has experienced higher carbon loss compared to the northern province. In contrast, the northern province features more fertile soil and a greater number of trees, which indicates better soil quality and higher carbon retention. Trees are natural carbon sinks and serve as essential elements in maintaining the balance of carbon in ecosystems. Therefore, considering the provided information, it can be concluded that the southern province likely experiences more carbon loss than the northern province due to the severe effects of degradation in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first person to climb the Mount of the Holy Cross is not well-documented, as it likely occurred before detailed records were kept. However, the first documented ascent of the Mount of the Holy Cross was by a team led by William Henry Jackson in August 1873. The first publicly available photograph published in National Geographic magazine refers to a later event and does not provide information about the person who first climbed the mount."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a negative review for a place","output":"Title: Disappointing Experience at The Hyped Haven I had a chance to visit The Hyped Haven last weekend, a place I was eagerly looking forward to trying after hearing all the rave reviews from friends and social media. However, my excitement was short-lived as I was met with a series of letdowns that called into question whether it was worth the effort, time, and resources. I am disappointed to say that my expectations were not met, and I will be sharing my thoughts on what went wrong in this review. Upon walking into The Hyped Haven, the first thing I noticed was the lack of proper lighting. The place felt drab and unwelcoming, a far cry from the trendy and cozy atmosphere I had anticipated. The dim lighting did not do the aesthetically pleasing décor justice, as it was difficult to appreciate its uniqueness. Moving on to the service, this was another aspect that left me less than impressed. The waiting staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized as they took an unusually long time to greet us, get the menus, and take our order. When I asked for recommendations, the server, albeit polite, appeared unsure of what to suggest and seemed to have little knowledge of the items on the menu. The food arrived after an agonizing wait of over 45 minutes. This would not have been an issue if the quality of the food had made up for the delay. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I ordered the Chef's Special Pasta, while my partner opted for the highly praised Haven Burger. My pasta was overcooked, and the sauce was overly rich and heavy on the salt. It lacked a harmonious balance of flavors, and the experience of eating it was underwhelming. The burger, although cooked to the right temperature, was drowning in a pool of condiments which inhibited the taste of the beef patty and toppings. Sadly, the desserts did not save the day either. The Chocolate Lava Cake was underbaked in the middle, making it runny and unappealing with every bite. My partner's Panna Cotta was too stiff, indicating that too much gelatin was employed, and the accompanying fruit coulis lacked brightness in its taste. The ambience proved to be another fail. The noise level was surprisingly high, making it difficult for us to maintain a conversation. Between the loud music and other diners’ chatter, my partner and I were not able to relax and focus on our dining experience. Ultimately, the prices failed to justify the unfavorable experience we had. Given that The Hyped Haven is considered an upscale eatery with fairly steep prices, we expected them to deliver both quality service and exceptional food. In this case, the combined factors led to our overall disappointment. In conclusion, I had a negative experience at The Hyped Haven and would recommend potential visitors to think twice before visiting. With numerous other restaurants in the area offering better service, food, and atmosphere, I find it hard to justify returning when there are countless superior alternatives. I sincerely hope The Hyped Haven takes this review to heart and makes the necessary improvements to ensure future customers do not undergo the same disappointment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At the time the referee failed to spot the incident, but FIFA have now got involved, stating on their official website that they are set to investigate the 27-year-old's actions. Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence, and FIFA could ban the forward for up to two years. But what should his punishment be? Here, Sportsmail experts off their opinions on how they think Suarez should be disciplined... And a worldwide 15-match ban to impress on","output":"him the severity of his actions. Luis Suarez's actions during the 2014 World Cup match between Uruguay and Italy were unacceptable and have no place in the sport of football. Biting an opponent on the shoulder is not only dangerous, but it also demonstrates a complete lack of respect for both the game and fellow players. Therefore, to hold him accountable, the experts at Sportsmail believe that Suarez should receive a punishment that would send a strong message, not only to the player himself, but also to the entire footballing community. The proposed worldwide 15-match ban would be a significant penalty, as it would impact not only Suarez's international career, but also his future performance at the club level. By serving such an extensive ban, Suarez would miss key matches and have to work diligently to regain the trust and support of his coaches, teammates, and fans. In addition to the ban, experts also suggest that Suarez should face additional consequences for his actions. This could include a mandatory anger management course, a hefty fine, and a public apology to Giorgio Chiellini, the victim of the bite, as well as the entire footballing community. Furthermore, this incident offers an opportunity for FIFA to address the prevalence of unsportsmanlike conduct in the sport and to set a strong precedent for future offenders. Implementing stricter punishments and promoting fair play would serve as crucial steps in safeguarding the integrity of the game and ensuring that all players respect the rules. In conclusion, Luis Suarez should face a comprehensive punishment including a worldwide 15-match ban, therapy or anger management, financial penalties, and issuing a formal apology, to deter any future occurrences of such behavior. This disciplinary action would emphasize the importance of sportsmanship and respect in the game of football and serve as a reminder that unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated, both on and off the pitch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The year's best meteor shower returns for its August shooting star show, courtesy of a cloud of comet dust smacking into the Earth.      A bright Perseid meteor streaked down Saturday night (Aug. 7, 2010) over buildings at the Stellafane amateur astronomy convention in Springfield, Vermont. (Photo: Dennis di Cicco Sky & Telescope) Story Highlights Sunday and Monday nights are the best times to see the annual meteor shower      The fireballs will streak across the sky at nearly 134,000 miles per hour      You will have to stay up late; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn      Put out the lawn chair, set the alarm and maybe bring something to wet your whistle while you gaze into the nighttime sky — the year's best shooting star show has started.      August's annual Perseids meteor shower peaks Sunday and Monday, promising perhaps 70 meteors an hour those evenings.      \\"The Perseids are the good ones,\\" says meteorite expert Bill Cooke of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.      The Perseids take their name from their apparent origin in the constellation Perseus, the hero of ancient Greek myth born from a shower of heavenly gold. Known for producing fireballs that might streak across a third of the sky, they owe their brilliance to the speed — nearly 134,000 mph — with which they smack into the upper atmosphere. \\"It's also because of the size of the meteors,\\" Cooke says. The dust grains are about one-fifth of an inch across and burn nicely as they zip overhead.      Those dust grains come courtesy of Comet Swift-Tuttle, which circles the sun once every 133 years and leaves behind a debris trail. (Comets are basically dirty snowballs that develop tails when they approach the sun and start to melt. Different ones are responsible for other regular meteor showers, such as April's Lyrids, brought by Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, and November's Leonids brought by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.)      You will have to stay up late to see the Perseids at their peak; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn, particularly after the half-full moon sets at 1 a.m. on Monday, says Astronomy magazine's Michael Bakich. But they should appear at night during the week before and after the peak as well.      \\"Get out of the city and the lights to give yourself a chance to see them,\\" Bakich says. The rule of thumb is that you should be able to see all the stars of the Big Dipper — seven stars if you are counting — to give yourself enough darkness to catch the shooting stars. And give your eyes an hour to adjust.      \\"There will be a dozen 'ooh' moments in that hour,\\" Bakich says. \\"Ones when everyone will say, 'Did you see that?'\\"      Astronaut Ron Garan looks down on a Perseid meteor from the International Space Station. (Photo: Ron Garan / NASA)      Although the shooting stars seem to come from the constellation Perseus, don't look there to see them, Bakich advises. Instead, look about one-third of the sky down and away from the constellation to spot meteors streaking across the sky. \\"That makes them easier to pick out,\\" he says.      While you are enjoying the sky show, satellite operators are buttoning up spacecraft to protect them from the onslaught of comet dust, says Cooke, who prepares meteor shower forecasts each year for space businesses. While the 2013 Perseid shower won't affect the Hubble Space Telescope, according to Janet Anderson of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., at other times it might point the opening to its mirrors away from the direction of an outburst of meteors. Other satellites might turn vulnerable antennas away from them as well.      Clouds permitting, Cooke advises skywatchers this year to take their time and enjoy the nighttime show. \\"All you need is to lie flat on your back, and the reward is meteors.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ev828w ||||| One of the year's best astronomical events will light up the sky for the next five nights. Best of all, it's really easy to observe. You don't need telescopes or cameras, just a deckchair, blankets and a hot thermos to keep you company.      Wait until late at night. If the sky is clear, find the darkest site you can with a clear eastern horizon. Plonk yourself down in the chair facing east, cover up with the blanket and wait. The Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak in the pre-dawn skies on both 12 and 13 August.      The Perseids were once part of comet Swift-Tuttle. At 27 kilometres across, this is one of the largest. It orbits the sun every 133 years and last passed by in 1992. Whenever it approaches, the heat of the sun disintegrates its ice, creating a dusty tail and replenishing the Perseid stream. The Earth passes through this stream every August, sparking the meteor shower.      Each one of the meteors, sometimes called shooting stars, that you see is a tiny speck of dust as old as the formation of Earth and the other planets, 4.6bn years ago. It burns with incandescent glory because it has hit our atmosphere at a speed of 160,000 kilometres per hour (100,000 miles per hour).      This creates a shockwave that compresses a pocket of air in front of the dust grain and raises it to a temperature of a few thousand degrees. This is enough to burn up the dust and create a bright meteor.      Swift Tuttle is the largest object to regularly pass Earth. Its orbit is known well enough for astronomers to believe it does not pose a collision hazard for at least the next 2,000 years.      A Perseid meteor over the Roman castle of Bukelon, near Matochina in Bulgaria, on 13 August 2010. Photograph: Vassil Donev/EPA      The Perseids are generally considered the most active and reliable of the 64 meteor showers that Earth passes through every year. A recent Nasa study found that it offers the best chance out of all the meteor showers of seeing an ultra-bright meteor called a fireball.      Even if you don't see a fireball, you are guaranteed that there will be dozens of ordinary meteors every hour – providing the sky is clear and you can stay awake.

Stargazers are in for a show again on Monday night as the peak of the Perseid meteor shower once again illuminates the night sky.      Perseid meteors are particles from the debris trail on the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle and hit the Earth's atmosphere moving at 132,000 mph.      Unfortunately, clouds and showers threaten to obscure the show across a large swath of the country on Monday night. Most places from the East Coast through the Tennessee Valley and the central Plains will have to find breaks in the clouds to enjoy the show.      The best places to view the Perseid's will be across much of Florida, Texas and the Great Lakes, where the sky should be mostly clear for much of the night. Much of the West will also have good viewing conditions.      The nation's midsection will not catch much of the shower as a front slowly sags southward, posing a threat for violent and drenching thunderstorms.      RELATED:      Latest U.S. Satellite      AccuWeather.com Astronomy Blog      Share Your Pictures of the Meteor Shower      Much of the Northeast will also miss the display thanks to a front moving in from the west.      During the peak, the moon will be in a crescent phase, and will set in the sky by midnight in most locations. The dark sky will aid in the spectacle, allowing even fainter meteors to be seen.      \\"Any time you have a darker sky, that helps,\\" AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Mark Paquette said.      The shower, nicknamed the \\"Fireball Champion,\\" produces more meteors than any other annual shower and is typically bright enough at its peak to be seen in areas that suffer some light pollution.      \\"Most people consider this the best meteor shower of all to see shooting stars,\\" Paquette said.      If the weather or other plans prevented you from viewing the meteor shower on Sunday night, the show should be just as brilliant on Monday night--weather dependent. |||||Summary:","output":"The Perseids meteor shower is an annual event that peaks around August 12-13, lighting up the night sky as Comet Swift-Tuttle's debris trail collides with Earth's atmosphere.

No; The suggested answer focuses on the music video directed by Anton Corbijn and its critical acclaim rather than addressing the actual question about what the song \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is about.  A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by the band's frontman Kurt Cobain. The song was released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero\\" in 1993. While the interpretation of the song's meaning can vary, Kurt Cobain has mentioned in interviews that the lyrics were inspired by several themes, such as his personal and professional life, obsession, and love. The term \\"heart-shaped box\\" is believed to symbolize both love and the human body. In some interpretations, it represents a box that Cobain's then-wife Courtney Love had gifted to him filled with memorabilia, symbolizing their relationship. Another interpretation reflects that the song could be about Cobain's complex feelings towards the music industry and the feelings of being trapped by fame. In terms of the music video, it was indeed directed by Anton Corbijn and received critical acclaim. The video's imagery, which includes scenes of an old man climbing a crucifix, fetuses hanging on trees, and a heart in a box, contributes to the overall dark and surreal tone that further emphasizes the song's themes. To validate the answer, it would be important to focus on the themes and interpretations of the song itself in addition to the music video's role in portraying those themes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1990 just over half the cocaine imported into the U.S. came through Mexico, by 2007 that had risen to more than 90 percent, according to U.S. State Department estimates. Although violence between drug cartels has been occurring long before the war began, the government used its police forces in the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century with little effect. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected Mexican President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to put an end to drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against cartel operations, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now well over 25,000 troops involved. During the Felipe Calderón, the Mexican government has spent approximately US7 billion in an 18-month-old campaign against drug cartels. It is estimated that during 2006, there were about 2,000 drug-related violent deaths, about 2,300 deaths during 2007, and more than 6,200 people by the end of 2008. Many of the dead were gang members killed by rivals or by the government, some have been bystanders. Answer this question: How many more drug-related violent deaths were there in 2008 than in 2006?","output":"There were significantly more drug-related violent deaths in 2008 than in 2006. According to the provided data, there were approximately 2,000 drug-related deaths in 2006 and more than 6,200 in 2008. To find the difference in the number of deaths between these two years, you can subtract the number of deaths in 2006 from the number of deaths in 2008: 6,200 (deaths in 2008) - 2,000 (deaths in 2006) = 4,200 (difference in deaths) Therefore, there were 4,200 more drug-related violent deaths in 2008 than in 2006.

Long island was full of people and they used all their natural resources and burned fossil fuels while Snail island protected the environment and had fewer people living there.  Which island contributed more to global warming?  Hint: Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air. The answer to this question is:","output":"Long Island contributed more to global warming as compared to Snail Island. To begin with, Long Island was densely populated, which led to a higher rate of resource consumption. The residents of Long Island used their natural resources heavily and relied upon fossil fuels to meet their energy demands. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, results in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are known to trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the overall increase in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. Additionally, Long Island's industrial activity and other human activities likely resulted in deforestation, or the large-scale clearing of trees, to make way for development. As mentioned in the hint, trees are natural carbon sinks and absorb CO2 during the process of photosynthesis. When trees are cut down and forests destroyed, the ability of these ecosystems to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is severely compromised, further exacerbating the effects of global warming. On the other hand, Snail Island was characterized by its mindfulness towards environmental protection and conservation. With fewer people living there, resource consumption and the subsequent release of greenhouse gases were inherently lower than those of Long Island. Snail Island's focus on preserving the natural environment led to a reduced strain on its resources, and a lesser release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This allowed the island to play a lesser role in contributing to global warming. In conclusion, Long Island, with its densely populated regions, resource-intensive lifestyle, and reliance on fossil fuels, contributed significantly more to global warming compared to Snail Island, which prioritized environmental preservation and had a smaller population. The combined impact of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation on Long Island far exceeded the environmental footprint of Snail Island, making it a larger contributor to the global warming process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it. Select from: [+] Yes [+] It's impossible to say [+] No","output":"[+] No The sentence \\"A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it\\" is not true based on the given paragraph. Based on the provided information, a political decoy impersonates a politician or other person of importance to either draw attention away from them or to take risks on their behalf. The primary motive behind employing a political decoy is not for pure amusement or entertainment, but rather to serve strategic, practical, security-related, and political purposes. While a political decoy might get some personal satisfaction or enjoyment out of the act of impersonation, the main intent is to protect the person they are impersonating and/or to further the goals and objectives of the person, organization, or government employing them. In this sense, it is not an activity undertaken purely for fun but a task typically carried out with specific objectives in mind. Moreover, the concept of a political decoy goes beyond simple impersonation. In many cases, these decoys must have a keen understanding of the person they impersonate, their mannerisms, beliefs, and speaking style, to convincingly portray that individual in public. Their roles may extend to participating in public events, speaking engagements, or even engaging in diplomatic relations—all with the aim of protecting the real individual. Throughout history, there have been several notable political decoys, which have played crucial roles in different capacities. For example, one of the most famous political decoys in history is the alleged use of body doubles by Joseph Stalin. These decoys were believed to have been used for a range of purposes, including public appearances, to help maintain the Soviet leader's authority and security. Another example is the use of impersonators by Saddam Hussein, who employed lookalikes to potentially thwart assassination attempts and confuse his enemies. In conclusion, political decoys primarily impersonate someone for strategic, security-related, or political reasons rather than for mere personal amusement. While some may find the act of impersonation enjoyable, the main purpose of their role is to provide protection, strategic advantage, or misinformation to benefit the person they impersonate or the organization employing them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: President Barack Obama raised 45 million for his re-election bid in February, bringing his total to about 300 million for this election cycle, his campaign said Monday.      President Barack Obama speaks during a 'Lawyers for Obama Luncheon' fundraiser, Friday, March, 16, 2012, at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press)      Obama increased fundraising efforts during the month, collecting nearly twice as much as the 23 million per month average he raised during the final three months of 2011 and more than the 29.1 million he raised in January. The money was spread among Obama's campaign, the Democratic party and two campaign funds.      Obama's campaign said nearly 350,000 people contributed in February, and the average donation was about 59 for the entire election cycle. Nearly 98 percent of the donations were 250 or less.      The fundraising reports were being filed ahead of a Tuesday campaign finance deadline for presidential campaigns.      With Republicans locked in an extended primary campaign to win that party's nomination, Obama's team has tried to build a large 50-state operation that will help it register new voters, bring back past supporters and boost turnout. Obama's campaign had about 75 million in the bank through the end of January, and totals for February were not immediately available.      Campaign officials have implored supporters to donate money and get involved, pointing to Republican-leaning super political action committees that are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat the president. Obama's campaign said earlier this year that it would bless big-money super PACs supporting Democrats as a way of countering the Republican effort. That was a turnaround from Obama's earlier opposition to the new groups.      In an email to donors last week, campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll showing Obama trailing against Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and asked them to get involved.      \\"We're looking at a race that will be tighter than you think. And the other side has groups ready to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tear down President Obama,\\" Messina said.      Obama's totals for February fell short of the 56 million he raised in February 2008, when he was seeking the Democratic nomination against now-Secratary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.      Republicans said it was a sign of tepid support.      Kirsten Kukowski, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, said Obama was \\"having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term\\" following three years of \\"record debt, high unemployment and soaring gas prices and health care costs.\\"      Obama has boosted fundraising efforts in recent weeks, holding events last month in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Last week, Obama raised money in Chicago and Atlanta. ||||| RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski reacts to President Obama's 45M February haul, noting that it's far less than his February 2008 haul: “After three years of policies that have left our country with record debt, high unemployment, and soaring gas prices and healthcare costs, it’s clear President Obama is having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term. The president who ran on change and hope has left our country wanting and whether it’s showing in fundraising or in the polls, Americans are enthusiastic about replacing him in November.” ||||| Summary:","output":"In February 2012, Barack Obama raised 45 million for his re-election campaign, taking the total funds raised thus far to approximately 300 million. This figure was nearly double the 23 million average per month he had raised during the final quarter of 2011 and an increase from the 29.1 million raised in January 2012. The donations were from almost 350,000 contributors, and about 98% of them were 250 or less—a significantly smaller sum than the 56 million he raised in February 2008 when he was competing for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The funds were dispersed among the president's campaign, the Democratic party, and two campaign funds. The increase in fundraising efforts for February aimed to better consolidate support and counter the fundraising efforts of Republican-leaning super political action committees, which were expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat Obama. Campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll that showed Obama lagging behind Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and warned that the race would be tighter than expected. In response to the fundraising report, Republicans claimed that it showcased tepid support for Obama due to his administration's policies that led to a record debt, high unemployment, and growing gas prices and health care costs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this article, we will talk about a review that takes a closer look at Steve Jobs' life and how he changed the world with his ideas. We will learn more about how he thought, made decisions, and what kind of person he was. Every story has a beginning, so let's start with how Steve Jobs became the boss of Apple. One day, he and his friend Steve Wozniak, created a computer in their garage. Lots of people liked it, so they started a company to make more computers. Steve Jobs helped Apple grow and become very popular with his creative ideas and decisions. Steve Jobs was not just a clever person; he also had a special way of thinking. Some people say he was able to see things differently than others and had a way of making complicated things simple. This is why lots of people liked using Apple's products because they were easy to use and looked nice. Steve Jobs was known to be a hard worker and wanted everything to be perfect. This meant that sometimes he would not be happy with something unless it was done just right. He would often ask his team several times to make the same thing to get it perfect. However, not everybody liked Steve Jobs because he could be very bossy and hard to work with. But many people still admired him because he was so talented and had so many great ideas that made Apple better. Steve Jobs also went through some difficult times in his life. He once left Apple for a while but came back later and helped make the company even more successful. He also had health problems later on and was very brave during that time. In conclusion, this review of \\"Steve Jobs\\" helps us learn more about the boss of Apple, who was both a creative genius and a complex person. His ideas and imagination made lots of people happy by creating things they found useful, fun, and beautiful.

John Henry Newman, {'1': \\", '2': \\", '3': 'Cong.

He was known nationally by the mid-1830s. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Henry Newman was British.","output":"Yes, the next sentence does follow given the preceding text. John Henry Newman (21 February 1801 – 11 August 1890) was a religious figure from England in the 19th century, as mentioned in the text. Since England is a part of the United Kingdom, it is accurate to state that John Henry Newman was British. To provide more context and a detailed answer, John Henry Newman was born in London, England, which makes him a British national. Throughout his life, he made significant contributions to the religious landscape of England and the United Kingdom through his roles as an Anglican priest, poet, and theologian, and later as a Catholic cardinal.  Newman was an influential figure in the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive the religious traditions and practices within the Church of England, inspired by the early Christian church and the High Church Anglican tradition. He played a key part in voicing the theological foundations for this movement. However, his journey to Catholicism, prompted by his interest in the Fathers of the Church and his growing discomfort with Anglicanism's theological inconsistencies, made Newman an increasingly controversial figure within English religious circles. In 1845, he converted to Roman Catholicism and was subsequently ordained as a Catholic priest. This conversion further fueled the controversy surrounding his beliefs, as the Anglican Church and Roman Catholic Church had a history of strained relations in England. Despite the controversy, Newman continued to work as a theologian, philosopher, and writer, contributing to the intellectual life of the Roman Catholic Church. In recognition of his contributions to theology, Pope Leo XIII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 1879. Newman's works on theology and religious thought, particularly concerning the development of Christian doctrines, the nature of religious belief, and the relationship between faith and reason, had a lasting influence on both Anglican and Catholic traditions. In 2019, Newman was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis, further cementing his legacy as an important figure in British religious history."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs.  Question: suppose more eggs are laid happens, how will it affect more baby birds will grow into adults.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More The process outlined above describes the life cycle of a bird, which involves the bird laying eggs, the eggs hatching into baby birds, the baby birds eating and growing into adult birds, and then these adult birds finding mates and starting the process all over again. If more eggs are laid by the birds, this will directly impact the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. Laying more eggs will have a greater effect on the population because it increases the number of offspring that will grow into adults and potentially reproduce, thus adding more birds to the overall population. This increase in offspring can contribute to various impacts on the ecosystem and environment in which the birds reside. For example, a higher number of birds may lead to increased competition for resources such as food, water, and nesting sites among their own population and with other species as well. This can result in some birds not being able to find adequate amounts of food or an appropriate nesting site, which may potentially decrease the overall survival rate of the baby birds growing into adults. On the other hand, having more birds in the population can lead to a stronger presence against natural predators, as there will be more individuals available to defend against threats. This can also lead to a greater genetic diversity within the population, which may increase the adaptability and resilience of the species, making it more likely for them to survive and thrive in changing environments. The process of laying more eggs can also impact various ecological factors such as seed dispersal, pollination, and balance within food chains. For instance, if the bird species is a primary consumer and feeds on insects, an increased population could help to control insect populations, potentially having a beneficial impact on the ecosystem. Conversely, if their population becomes too high, it could ultimately lead to the decline of other species that the birds compete with or prey upon. In summary, laying more eggs will have a significant impact on the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. This effect can have a range of both positive and negative implications for the ecosystem and environment, based on the relationships between the bird species, their food sources, and their interactions with other organisms. Overall, the perturbation of laying more eggs can lead to a more significant effect on the number of baby birds growing into adults, influencing the bird population, their ecological roles, and the dynamics of the ecosystem in which they reside."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on July 21, 1945, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, Lowe began his professional darts career in the early 1970s and went on to establish himself as a top player in the world of darts for over three decades. John Lowe earned the nickname 'Old Stoneface' because of his stoic, unemotional demeanor, and poker-faced expressions during his matches, which many viewed as an essential psychological weapon against his opponents. He was known for his ability to maintain composure and concentration regardless of the situation in a match, which helped him to become one of the most successful darts players of all time. Throughout his illustrious career, Lowe has accumulated numerous accolades and records, making him a true legend in the history of darts. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Three-time World Champion: John Lowe won the prestigious Embassy World Championship title in 1979, 1987, and 1993. With these wins, he became the first player to win the world title in three different decades. 2. Two-time World Masters Champion: Lowe secured the prestigious Winmau World Masters title in 1976 and 1980, one of the premier events on the darts calendar. 3. One-time World Cup Singles Champion: In 1981, Lowe triumphed in the World Cup Singles competition held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 4. Numerous other titles: John Lowe's impressive resume also includes victories in the British Open, British Matchplay, North American Open, News of the World Darts Championship, Swedish Open, and Finnish Open, among others. 5. Groundbreaking achievement: In October 1984, John Lowe made history by becoming the first-ever darts player to score a televised nine-dart finish (maximum 501 points in just nine darts, considered a perfect game in darts) during the MFI World Matchplay in Slough, England. This exceptional feat saw him receive £102,000 in prize money, which was a record at the time. In addition to his numerous accolades and accomplishments, John Lowe was also a key figure in helping to popularize the sport of darts in the United Kingdom and around the world. His rivalry with fellow Englishman Eric Bristow paved the way for some unforgettable matches, elevating darts to new heights and drawing significant audiences to their duels. After retiring from professional darts, Lowe has remained connected to the sport he loves as a commentator, exhibition player, and coach. John Lowe's incredible talent, determination, and 'Old Stoneface' persona are firmly etched in the annals of darts history, making him a truly legendary figure in the sport."},{"instruction":"Choices: 1).

Movie title: Snakes on a Plane Context: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

His parents had passed away when he was very young, and the kung fu school was the only home he had ever known. The boy, who was named Li, showed incredible talent and determination in mastering the martial art. He dreamed of one day becoming a famous kung fu master and bringing honor and fortune to the school that had raised him. One day, while practicing his forms in the courtyard, Li caught the attention of Wang, a wealthy and influential businessman in the village. Wang was impressed by Li's focus and skill, and he invited the young orphan to join him for dinner at his home. Li graciously accepted the invitation, and the seeds of a lasting friendship were sown. Over a splendid feast, Li discovered that Wang's daughter, Li's childhood friend, worked at a five-star French restaurant in the big city. She had honed her culinary skills and worked her way up to become the head chef. Wang was visibly proud of his daughter's achievements, and Li couldn't help but feel inspired by her success too. As they continued to bond during the meal, Wang expressed his love for the game of basketball. He told Li about a local basketball team he was sponsoring – First University. The team was good, but they were missing something – a new star player that would tip them into greatness. Wang Li saw something special in Li and, knowing the boy's extraordinary physical abilities, invited him to play basketball for First University as the new star of their team. Li felt honored and excited by the opportunity. Even though he had never played basketball before, Li accepted Wang's offer, ready for a new challenge in his life. In no time, Li's natural aptitude for sports paired with his kung fu skills helped him adapt rapidly to basketball. He soon rose to prominence as an exciting and unique player, capturing the imagination of fans both within and outside the First University. As the city's annual basketball championship approached, Li's team was well-aware of the hurdles they were about to face. Rumors swirled regarding the opposing team, known for their ruthless and dirty tactics to prevent First University from winning, up to and including injuring their star players, Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan. Li's teammates were concerned and fearful, but Li stood steadfast, adamant about finding a way to overcome these challenges. Li decided to combine his kung fu skills with basketball techniques, creating a unique and unstoppable form of play. His teammates followed suit, training diligently under his guidance. This new fusion of martial arts and basketball seemed almost invincible, and Li knew they could triumph in the championship game as long as they played together and stayed focused. The day of the final match arrived, and the atmosphere at the stadium was electric. Wang Li, his daughter, the entire village, and the kung fu school had come to cheer for Li and the First University team. The opposing team tried their underhanded tactics to bring down Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan, but Li and his teammates stood strong, fighting back with their newfound skills. In the end, Li's unwavering determination and innovative play inspired his team to victory, overcoming adversity and claiming the championship for First University. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, and Wang Li couldn't be prouder of his protégé. From that day on, Li was hailed as a hero in his village and the basketball community. He had proven that the power of determination, skill, and teamwork could overcome even the greatest challenges. And although Li's heart always yearned for the kung fu school that was his first home, he knew that he had found his place in the world on the basketball court as a shining example to others of what was possible when one's passion is fueled by resilience and perseverance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Obesity protects against radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through poorly defined mechanisms. Adipocytokines are produced in adipose tissue and modulate inflammatory responses and radiographic joint damage in animal models. The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that adipocytokines modulate inflammation and radiographic joint damage in patients with RA.', 'We compared serum concentrations of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and visfatin in 167 RA patients and 91 control subjects. The independent association between adipocytokines and body mass index (BMI), measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha]), and radiographic joint damage (Larsen score; n = 93 patients) was examined in RA patients by multivariable regression analysis first controlling for age, race, and sex, and then for obesity (BMI) and inflammation (TNFalpha, IL-6, and CRP).', 'Concentrations of all adipocytokines were significantly higher in RA patients than in controls; for visfatin and adiponectin, this association remained significant after adjusting for BMI, inflammation, or both. Visfatin concentrations were associated with higher Larsen scores, and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, race, sex, disease duration, BMI, and inflammation (odds ratio [OR] 2.38 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32-4.29], P = 0.004). Leptin concentrations showed a positive association with the BMI (rho = 0.58, P < 0.01) and showed a negative association with the Larsen score after adjustment for inflammation (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.17-0.61], P < 0.001), but not after adjustment for BMI (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.42-1.73], P = 0.67).Question: Are adipocytokines associated with radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis?

Tracking what Republican lawmakers have said about Donald Trump Donald Trumpâs impending nomination has Republican lawmakers â many who are facing tough reelection bids this cycle â contemplating how closely to embrace him. Some have already refused to support him, while others are doing so with varying levels of excitement. Here are four ways lawmakers have approached the question and some notable lawmakers in each camp: Senator and former presidential candidate Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in the Senate. Another, freshman Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has called for a third-party candidate to mount a challenge and presumably whittle away at Trumpâs support.

What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text provides an overview of different positions of Republican lawmakers on Donald Trump's nomination in 2016. These positions are categorized into four main groups: strong critics, hesitant supporters, those expressing reluctant support for the sake of party unity, and enthusiastic supporters. 1. Criticism: There are those like Senator Lindsey O. Graham and Sen. Ben Sasse who have been outspoken critics of Trump. Their criticism focused on Trump's perceived disregard for the constitution and inconsistency as a conservative. They've made strong statements in public and on social media, calling for alternatives to Trump. 2. Hesitant Approach: Certain lawmakers, such as Speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, were more cautious with their support for Trump. Ryan, for instance, vocalized his desire to ensure that the Republican standard bearer indeed upholds their standards. The responses in this category ranged from expressing fear about the prospective nominee to declaring personal votes for other candidates in the primaries. 3. Reluctant Support: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is noted as expressing a strategy to \\"drop [Trump] like a hot rock\\" should he earn the nomination, but when Trump became the presumptive nominee, McConnell and other leaders began expressing support for him, although less enthusiastically. This group seemed to support Trump for the sake of party unity and to win down-ballot races. They made public pledges of support and issued joint statements endorsing Trump.  4. Enthusiastic Support: Finally, there were those who supported Trump's nomination enthusiastically. The most prominent in this group was Senator Jeff Sessions, who noted that Trump's response to America's situation was \\"pretty darn good\\", and felt that Trump was the candidate best poised to make America great again.

Article: The candidate who is longing for election to the highest office in the United States must be native-born American citizen who is at least 35 years old and who has lived in the United States for at least 14 years. The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates  then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census  . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year. The election results are not official, however, until the following January, when Congress meets in a joint conference to...

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

A: Answer:","output":"When we move down a group of elements on the periodic table, the electronegativity of the elements generally decreases. So, the correct option is: IV. it decreases. The decrease in electronegativity occurs as we move down a group because the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells. These additional electron shells cause the outer electrons to be further away from the nucleus, leading to a weaker attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. As a result, the ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons decreases, leading to a decrease in electronegativity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This is especially true if the roots are growing horizontally and expanding under the sidewalk, leading to an uneven surface and potential damage. Moreover, tree roots need space to grow and obtain nutrients; locating a tree near a sidewalk may limit the area in which roots can expand, causing them to push against the sidewalk, resulting in cracks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: To prepare the avocado pit for planting,","output":"To prepare an avocado pit for planting, follow these steps: Step 1: Extract the pit - Cut open a ripe avocado carefully without harming the pit inside. - Remove the pit gently and wash off any remaining avocado flesh. - Pat the pit dry with a paper towel. Step 2: Identify the top and bottom of the pit - Look closely at the shape of the pit. The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flatter end is the bottom. - The top is the part of the pit that will sprout, while roots will grow from the bottom. Step 3: Insert toothpicks - Take 3-4 toothpicks and insert them evenly around the avocado pit's circumference, approximately halfway down its length. The toothpicks will provide support and prevent the pit from fully submerging in water. - Position the toothpicks so that they are sticking out at a slightly upward angle. Step 4: Suspend the pit over a glass or jar - Place the avocado pit with the toothpicks over a glass or jar, ensuring the bottom part of the pit is submerged in water. - Make sure the glass or jar is transparent so you can monitor the water level and root growth. Step 5: Provide optimal conditions - Choose a spot for the glass or jar where it will receive plenty of indirect sunlight and remain at room temperature. - Check the water level daily to ensure the bottom of the pit is submerged. Replenish or change the water as needed to maintain cleanliness and avoid odors or mold. Step 6: Wait for the pit to sprout - It can take several weeks to a few months for the avocado pit to sprout. During this time, keep monitoring the water level and maintain clean water. - Once the pit splits and a small sprout emerges from the top, and roots begin to grow downward, the pit is ready for planting. Step 7: Plant the avocado pit - Prepare a pot with well-draining soil. The pot should have a drainage hole to prevent excess water buildup. - Carefully transplant the sprouted avocado pit into the pot, with the roots extending downward into the soil. - Bury the pit in the soil, leaving half or slightly less than half of the pit exposed. - Water the soil thoroughly, ensuring it is evenly moist, and place the pot in a location with bright, indirect sunlight. Step 8: Care for the avocado plant - Water the plant regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between watering sessions. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. - Monitor the growth of the plant and consider adding a support stake if needed. - As the plant grows, you can gradually introduce it to more sunlight and eventually repot it into a larger container if necessary. By following these steps, you will have successfully prepared and planted an avocado pit. Remember to be patient, care for your plant, and enjoy watching it grow!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

BOJ's Backfire Hangs Over Central Bankers as IMF Meetings Start The world’s central bankers, already hitting limits of their effectiveness on growth and inflation, are now contending with another risk: that additional stimulus could produce lackluster results and undercut investor confidence. The Bank of Japan’s decision in January to take interest rates negative has sent bond yields tumbling, while doing little to curb a surging yen that’s squeezing the world’s third-biggest economy just when it needs a weaker currency. That’s put even more monetary and fiscal stimulus on the agenda at a time when Japanese households and companies are increasingly doubting the program. “Japan is bringing bad news to the world,” said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG and a former BOJ official. “It’s demonstrating that massive monetary easing doesn’t work for everyone. Any additional stimulus may invite criticism from other central banks.” The decline in credibility in Japan is a warning sign for central bankers and finance ministers who gather this week in Washington for spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, as well as a Group of 20 session. If policy makers around the globe fail to gain traction soon with their actions, that risks a relapse into too-low inflation and even weaker growth, possibly roiling financial markets and increasing the threat that Japan-style stagnation spreads to more advanced economies. The failure of policy to revive prices and growth in Japan would be a warning to all developed economies that need to break out into a cycle of investment, hiring, and slightly higher inflation. “You’ve had a combination of this massive crisis that causes prolonged, weak growth and layered on top of that a series of other shocks that undercut any optimism,” said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “It is dangerous to be in this situation for so long because it becomes self-fulfilling.” Even after the financial-market swoon of the first quarter was reversed by aggressive European Central Bank action and the Federal Reserve’s and Bank of England’s pivots to a longer period of accommodation, the weak world economy continues to draw concern. The IMF on Tuesday will release its updated World Economic Outlook, which is likely to show a dip in the global growth forecast following a reduction in the previous projections in January. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said last week that expansion “remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.” Fed Chair Janet Yellen said March 29 that global developments pose risks to the U.S. economy, especially uncertainty around the pace of Chinese growth that sent stocks tumbling earlier in the first quarter. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Finance Minister Taro Aso will be in the hot seat in Washington as they defend policies that have disrupted markets without solving Japan’s underlying economic problems. Kuroda’s freedom to double down on stimulus to stoke inflation and growth may be limited by G-20 agreements to avoid the competitive devaluation of currencies. He’s also up against critics in the investment community who argue that the central bank is harming the debt market and is on the cusp of running out of bonds to buy. The 71-year-old governor maintains that all options are on the table, including a deeper cut to the negative rate, and increased purchases of assets ranging from Japanese government bonds to exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts. Fiscal stimulus may be more likely, with Tokyo abuzz in recent weeks with speculation that the Abe government will compile a supplementary spending package to bolster an existing record budget for this fiscal year. “Kuroda is likely to face a lot of questions,” said Credit Suisse’s Shirakawa, no relation to former BOJ chief Masaaki Shirakawa. “But I don’t think he can just sit tight when the economy is on the verge of returning to deflation. He’ll have to expand stimulus. Of course, other nations won’t be happy.” Japan’s experience with negative interest rates is rippling through policy circles. Lagarde has said that the world would be in a “much worse place today” without negative rates in Europe and Japan. Yet her former chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said Friday that he’s not a fan of the policy because it interferes with banks. New York Fed President William C. Dudley said Friday that if the Fed needed to provide additional stimulus, “we might not decide to go to negative rates for a whole variety of reasons” and would instead use other means of easing in the event of a U.S. downturn, which Fed officials aren’t forecasting. The rise in the yen -- it’s up 11 percent against the dollar this year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg -- is troublesome because it sets up more disinflation and export drag in a major economy where aggressive policy stimulus has already been tried. “Theoretically, central banks should always be able to raise” inflation, said Mark Spindel, a former World Bank official who now runs Potomac River Capital LLC in Washington. “They don’t tell you what happens if it doesn’t work.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Central bankers' repeated attempts to stimulate sluggish global growth may be hurting investor confidence, as investors worry the measures could lead to disappointing returns, a situation reflected in the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) negative interest rates, which have caused bonds yields to collapse while doing little to stop the yen from soaring. The BOJ's decision to push rates into negative territory, alongside its aggressive rhetoric, have been blamed for causing a storm of doubt among Japanese households and companies, while the central bank's solutions are causing increasing concern among global financial leaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Why Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon has been called ‘the most dangerous woman in Britain’ LONDON -- Nicola Sturgeon is on a roll. The most senior politician in Scotland -- and the woman leading the drive for Scottish independence -- is in Washington as part of a four-day tour of the United States that's being called a huge public relations success. The Scotsman newspaper said she was “a hit” on \\"The Daily Show\\" earlier this week, where she was jokingly compared to Saddam Hussein. The Daily Mail said she wooed MSNBC’s \\"Morning Joe\\" as she talked breezily with the hosts about dying her gray hair. In Washington on Wednesday and Thursday, Sturgeon will give speeches at the World Bank and the Council on Foreign Relations. On this side of the pond, Sturgeon’s pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) will be delighted by a new poll showing support for the party has risen since the British election last month, when the party scooped up 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats. So, who is this shining political star? 1. She is ‘the most dangerous woman in Britain’ At least that’s what her critics call her. Sturgeon is the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the SNP, which wants to break up the United Kingdom. The SNP is the third-largest party in the House of Commons and stands out from the other main parties for its left-wing rhetoric, including calls to “end austerity.” Under Sturgeon’s leadership, party membership has surged. “She is hugely dangerous to unionism, to anybody who wants the U.K. to stay together, for the simple reason that she is devastatingly good at what she does,” Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, told a recent BBC Panorama program. 2. Before last year’s referendum, Sturgeon said that such a vote for independence would be a “once in a generation” event. Don’t bet on it. In September, Scotland decisively rejected independence, 55 percent to 45 percent. Both Sturgeon and her predecessor said that a vote on independence was a once in a generation opportunity. There's a possibility that “once in a generation” could mean “a couple of years.” Although Sturgeon insisted during the recent general election that a vote for the SNP was not a vote for a second referendum, commentators say that the whole independence question is not off the table. Next May, Scots will go to the polls for Scottish parliamentary elections. The SNP is on course to increase its majority, and it could include an independence referendum in its election manifesto. Separately, sometime before the end of 2017, Britain will hold an in/out referendum on its membership in the European Union. Sturgeon has said if Britain votes to leave the E.U., it could trigger another independence vote in Scotland. “My gut says we will see an independent Scotland in our lifetimes,” Sturgeon told the hosts of \\"Morning Joe.\\" 3. She’s not a comedian, but … In his biography, “Nicola Sturgeon: A Political Life,” the journalist David Torrance quotes a comedian asking Sturgeon what she would tell her 16-year-old self, to which she replied: “Lighten up ... and then the girl of sixteen would say ‘eff off.’” But the 44-year-old political veteran has lightened up over the years, even honing her comedy chops on \\"The Daily Show.\\" She was mistakenly billed as a \\"comedian\\" on the show’s Web site, an error she immediately brought up with Stewart, saying: “You raised all these expectations that I’m going to be funny, and I’m a politician. And as you know politicians are rarely very funny.” But she landed some jokes of her own. When talking about Scotland’s oil reserves, Stewart asked: “You have oil? May we invade you?” Sturgeon responded: “I think this is progress because you just heard there Jon, presumably on behalf of the United States, asking permission to invade an oil-producing country. It doesn’t usually work that way.” 4. Margaret Thatcher was a huge influence Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister, is a looming figure for Sturgeon. There has long been widespread opposition to Thatcher’s economic policies by the Scots, who blame the Iron Lady for taking on the miners and letting state-funded industries fail. In his biography, Torrance quotes Sturgeon as saying: \\"Thatcher was the motivation for my entire political career. I hated everything she stood for.\\" Sturgeon grew up in Dreghorn, a former mining town in the west of Scotland. The daughter of Robert, an electrician, and Joan, a dental nurse, she was a studious but shy child. But when she was 16, she summoned the courage to ring the doorbell of a local candidate for the SNP and ask if she could help campaign. She was the first in her family to go to university, studying law at the University of Glasgow. Over the course of her long political career, she has lost seven elections, according to the BBC. She recently told the broadcaster that the stream of defeats helped to forge her character. “I’m very very grateful that I suffered so many defeats as a politician, before I experienced success. Because we know what it’s like to lose, and we know hard it is to persuade people to vote for us and to win,” she said. Nearly 30 years since the shy but tenacious teenager joined the SNP, Sturgeon is now one of the most popular politicians in the United Kingdom. Karla Adam is a reporter in the Washington Post’s London bureau. Before joining the Post in 2006, she worked as a freelancer in London for the New York Times and People magazine.","output":"Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), has been called \\"the most dangerous woman in Britain\\" by her critics due to her ability to influence and possibly break up the United Kingdom. Sturgeon has been a prominent force in the push for Scottish independence and has been enjoying increased popularity in recent times. Despite the rejection of Scottish independence in a 2014 referendum, Sturgeon has not ruled out another vote on the matter in the future, particularly if the UK votes to leave the European Union in an upcoming referendum. Under her leadership, SNP membership has surged, making the party the third-largest in the House of Commons. Sturgeon, who started her political career campaigning against former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies, has now become one of the most popular politicians in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible. At this point, Emilio's superior, attractive female Lt.

Lean town used insecticides, while Bean town did not. Lean town had high levels of air pollution.  Which town had fewer inhabitants experiencing cancer?  Hint: Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, we can infer that Bean town is likely to have fewer inhabitants experiencing cancer. Lean town uses insecticides, which are known to cause cancer, and they also have high levels of air pollution which is associated with various health issues including cancer. On the other hand, Bean town does not use insecticides, suggesting a lower cancer risk due to the absence of those chemicals. Additionally, there's no mention of high air pollution levels in Bean town.

I didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do. It passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although admittedly it's no better quality than that. It's true that the acting isn't great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me. The Becks are on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now that's romantic!) The work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work?) but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine (huh? That connection completely lost me.) Bitten by a bat while he's in the cave, he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is of a young girl, who is described as having her throat ripped out. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's (meaning throat ripped out? - How could anyone think that was an accident?) And what's with the sheriff? He seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. It's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating theme songs I've ever heard in a movie.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The main activity of this band of mindless vampires in the movie \\"Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural\\" seems to revolve around creating chaos and spreading fear in the isolated town of Asteroth. They are depicted as aristocratic-looking beings with white faces, long black coats, and top hats, striking terror into the hearts of the townspeople and anyone who comes across them. In the film, the vampires serve as a menacing opposition force for young Lila Lee and the other residents of Asteroth. They are shown pursuing the bus Lila is traveling in, attacking when the opportunity arises, and generally causing unrest and uncertainty. The vampires are noted to be the ones who attack the monstrous-looking ghouls surrounding Lila when her bus breaks down, further showcasing their predatory nature and overall aggression. Additionally, some of the vampires, like Lemora, seem to have ulterior motives that extend beyond simply causing chaos and fear. In Lemora's case, she aims to have Lila go through a ceremony in which she will become immune to her father's \\"disease,\\" which could potentially turn her into one of them. This plan suggests that the vampires may also have a goal of growing their numbers and possibly controlling or manipulating people to suit their purposes. Given the detailed plot summary of the movie, it appears that the band of mindless vampires plays a significant role in the story's conflict while also providing a sinister and supernatural element to the movie. This dark atmosphere and sense of danger contribute to the movie's overall effectiveness in its attempt to tell a thrilling and captivating tale.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Talking Early About How Life Should End Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work. Starting with this article, FIXES will appear Tuesdays rather than Fridays. For many years now, my mother has talked to my brother and me — often — about how she wants to die. She is still in good health. But when it happens, we both know that she wants above all to die quickly and without pain. She wants no heroic measures. Because my brother and I know this, and because she has the proper legal documents, she is likely to die as she wishes. My mother is unusual. Not in what she wants — a Pew Research Center study indicates that 57 percent of Americans would ask their doctor to stop treatment so they could die if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain. What sets my mom apart is that she has been unafraid to talk to us about her wishes. Most Americans don’t do that. Of adults 75 and over, the study found that only 17 percent had talked to their families about their end-of-life wishes. It is an uncomfortable conversation. It always seems too early to talk to a loved one about how she wants to die — until it’s too late, and she can no longer make decisions for herself. But perhaps soon, more Americans will be like my mom. On Jan. 1, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent talking to patients about their end-of-life wishes. This is a big deal, but far from enough. End-of-life conversations need to become something families just do. There’s one place in America like that now: La Crosse, Wis. La Crosse started down this path in 1984, when Bernard Hammes, a philosopher by training, was hired as director of medical humanities at the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation. His job was to work with medical personnel to improve their skills and help them make decisions in ethically fraught situations. In one two-month period, Hammes saw three very elderly patients who had suffered devastating strokes and kidney failure, were being kept alive with dialysis, and could not speak for themselves. If the doctors stopped dialysis, the patients would die. But even on dialysis, the patients would never recover from their strokes. “None of the families had ever talked with the parent about the parent’s perspective on dialysis and when to stop,” Hammes said. “Families were going to have to live with the question of ‘did I do the right thing for my mom or father?’ and they would never know the answer.” These patients had not gotten sick suddenly. They had long, progressive illnesses and had been in care at Gundersen for years — and no one had thought to begin that conversation. The lack of communication is often catastrophic for patients who do not want heroic measures. When family members don’t know a relative’s wishes, they often feel they must show their love by asking that everything be done. Anything short of the maximum seems like abandonment or betrayal. And that makes the choice also terrible for families. “I witnessed frequent and repeated moral distress that health professionals and families had making decisions when there were no good decisions,” Hammes said. “It was almost exclusively based on the fact that we didn’t know what the patient wanted.” Research shows that families who are unaware of a patient’s wishes suffer much more stress, anxiety and depression than those who are aware. “It was a difference of night and day,” said Hammes. “The difference it makes in people’s lives is so clear and big that not to do it seems cruel.” Hammes started a program to begin end-of-life conversations with dialysis patients and their families. Within two years, he said, almost all the families of dialysis patients knew their loved one’s wishes. In 1991, Gundersen set up a task force to spread the program throughout La Crosse, which included the Franciscan Hospital and the Skemp Clinic, alongside the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation’s hospital and clinic. All four collaborated, along with nursing homes, hospices and smaller hospitals. The goal was not simply to have people fill out an advance directive and put it in their medical records. A written directive alone, members of the task force reasoned, could do more harm than good if it came as a surprise to the family, said Hammes. “We don’t think mom understood what she signed,” was a common response. Just as important as the legal document was a conversation with the patient and her family. The patient would need to understand the options — for example, that “do everything necessary to keep me alive” can mean intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which on a frail elderly person can break her ribs and sternum; those who survive it often do so with abdominal bleeding and neurological damage. And the family had to agree to support the patient’s decisions. “We really changed the nature of the question,” said Hammes. “It’s not: ‘How do you fill out this legal document,’ but ‘What does good care look like if you become ill and may not recover?’ At the most basic human level, what families face in those moments is, ‘What does it mean to love my mom or dad when they’re not going to recover, but we could still do some things to keep them alive? What does it mean to take good care of my mom at this point?’” The task force brought its message to local churches, senior centers and community groups. Inside health care organizations, it became evident that doctors didn’t have time for these conversations, but also that doctors weren’t required. Instead, the task force trained nurses, social workers and chaplains. Today, Hammes said, 96 percent of people who die in La Crosse County have had a conversation with relatives about how they want to spend their last days, and those wishes have been entered into their electronic medical records. Read previous contributions to this series. President Obama tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin derailed it with a single Facebook post: “The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.” With that, she gave a rallying cry to the anti-ObamaCare right. Palin’s post won PolitiFact’s 2009 “Lie of the Year” award. A year later, the Obama administration tried again to cover advance care planning decisions. Again, it proved too politically toxic. Today the political climate has improved. Advance care planning is no longer coupled to Obamacare, and Medicare’s decision to cover end-of-life conversations will have a ripple effect. Some private insurers already cover these conversations, and when Medicare starts, the rest will most likely follow. Last Thursday, WPS Health Solutions, Wisconsin’s largest nonprofit insurer, announced that its WPS Health Insurance and Arise Health Plan would begin to cover advance care planning conversations as of September. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has introduced legislation each year to reimburse and encourage care planning conversations, on a scale going beyond what Medicare is proposing. This year, his Care Planning Act has three Democratic and three Republican original co-sponsors and the endorsement of dozens of organizations. The issue is personal for Warner. His mother had Alzheimer’s disease for 11 years before her death in 2010, and during the last eight or nine years she didn’t speak. “My father and sister took care of my mom 24/7 at home with a little bit of extra help until the last week or two,” he said. “I was a well-informed citizen” — exceedingly so; for much of that time he was governor of the state — “but we never had the conversation in our own family. Even though both of Mom’s parents had Alzheimer’s, we never sat down with my mom and asked her and thought this fully through. It is not always the easiest thing to talk through.” Gunderson has bundled its strategies, training curriculum and materials into a package called Respecting Choices, which, according to Hammes, is being used in about 125 American hospitals and several other countries. The program is also being studied in a randomized control trial with sites in six European countries. Others are now spreading Gundersen’s program. Minnesota was the first of a half-dozen states to establish a program called Honoring Choices. One other was Wisconsin; John Maycroft, the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society, said that Honoring Choices Wisconsin works with 28 health care organizations — covering about half the state’s patients — to train staff to use Respecting Choices. The group also helps health care organizations make these conversations a part of routine care — for example, by finding a physician to champion it at each site. It trains advocates for it in community settings like churches, and makes videos for Wisconsin public television. As Respecting Choices spreads, it encounters a major obstacle that was not present in La Crosse. At Gundersen and the other founding organizations, doctors and other staff members did not (and still do not) bill for each procedure, a system called fee-for-service. Instead, they draw salaries. This mattered because insurers and Medicare don’t reimburse health care personnel for having these conversations — it’s unbillable time. Because staff members in La Crosse are largely salaried, that’s not an issue for them. But fee-for-service does matter on another level, even in La Crosse: Having end-of-life conversations often results in patients choosing less invasive health care. Gundersen spends less than the vast majority of American hospitals to care for inpatients in the last two years of their life; in 2010, for example, its spending was 40 percent below the national average. (The end-of-life conversations were not the only factor, but they were undoubtedly a major one.) Since the last two years of life for patients with chronic illness are responsible for a third of Medicare’s costs, eliminating unwanted invasive care is great for taxpayers. But it’s not as great for hospitals, which take in less money if they can’t fill those beds. Although hospitals are switching slowly — too slowly — to value-based medicine, which pays according to quality, not quantity, of care, most hospitals still have a perverse incentive to provide as much medical care as possible. Even so, many fee-for-service hospitals are beginning to adopt advance care planning. “So many clinicians have the experience of performing CPR on a 90-year-old woman with heart disease,” said Maycroft. “They remember what they felt and saw in the patient, and they’re doing that because they never had a conversation. This is really important. It affects everyone in the world — literally. That’s what motivates people to do this.” Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

Correction: October 27, 2015 An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society. The director is John Maycroft, not Maywood. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Starting on January 1st, 2021, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent discussing end-of-life wishes with their patients. This is a significant change in policy and suggests that end-of-life conversations could become commonplace in American families. Discussing end-of-life preferences can not only ensure that a patient's wishes are respected but also reduce the stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by families who are unsure or unaware of their loved one's desires. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a program called Respecting Choices was implemented, resulting in 96% of people dying in the county having had conversations with relatives about their end-of-life wishes. End-of-life conversations often lead to patients choosing less invasive healthcare options, reducing hospital spending on inpatients with chronic illnesses in their last two years of life. Although this could benefit taxpayers and promote value-based medicine, some hospitals may face financial challenges due to an incentivization for providing the maximum amount of medical care possible. As end-of-life planning legislation and initiatives continue to gain support in the U.S., hospitals and healthcare providers may see more widespread adoption of advance care planning, benefiting both patients and their families during difficult times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes?  Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town.  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. The answer is:","output":"Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes. This is because he has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm, resulting in a lower risk of chemical runoff carrying those excess nutrients to nearby rivers or lakes. On the other hand, Jimbo has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farm, which increases the risk of creating dead zones due to the excessive growth of water plants and algae caused by the dissolved fertilizers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1966, The New York Times referred to him as the \\"Father of Biophilosophy.\\" According to Times journalist and author Howard Taubman, \\"he never forgets... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\\" Salk told his cousin, Joel Kassiday, at a meeting of the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future on Capitol Hill in 1984 that he was optimistic that ways to prevent most human and animal diseases would eventually be developed. Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \\"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\\" without progress.  Salk describes his \\"biophilosophy\\" as the application of a \\"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\\" He went into more detail in two of his books, Man's Unfolding, and The Survival of the Wisest. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:  \\"I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature.... People think of biology in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important.... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\\", he says. \\"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.\\"  His definition of a \\"biophilosopher\\" is \\"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\\"  Just prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled Millennium of the Mind. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Jonas Salk was a very important scientist who helped create a vaccine for a disease called polio.

He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life.  One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood   of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition  . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me, too.

Before âOrange Is the New Blackâ or âArrested Developmentâ or âHouse of Cardsâ there was âLilyhammer,â the original Netflix original series. Now that a second season of the show is arriving on Friday, it feels as if a landmark has been reached â one full cycle in the companyâs new life as a content provider. âOriginalâ has an asterisk in this case â Netflix shares âLilyhammerâ with the Norwegian network NRK, where it appears first as a television series. And itâs the showâs hybrid nature that makes it interesting. Built on the persona that its American star, Steven Van Zandt, developed as the mobster Silvio Dante on HBOâs âSopranos,â the Netflix series is an occasionally violent, low-key Nordic comedy. It combines affectionate sendups of gangster-film conventions with culture-clash satire that cuts both ways, making fun of the Scandinavian welfare state while tacitly critiquing American rapaciousness. Mr. Van Zandtâs Johnny Henriksen is the avatar of that cutthroat imperialistic menace. Having chosen Lillehammer, Norway, as his witness-protection destination (he liked the way it looked during the 1994 Winter Olympics), he proceeds to take over. Every feature of Norwegian life he finds inconvenient â mandatory language classes, socialized medicine â can be overcome with bribery, blackmail and the occasional beating. In the first season, Johnny opened a bar that echoed Silvioâs Bada Bing club in âThe Sopranos,â and fell in love with a schoolteacher whose son was a level-headed, teenage version of Tony Sopranoâs favorite nephew, Christopher. He also gathered a motley band of welfare bums and petty thieves and turned them into his crew, teaching them Arctic omertÃ (leading to an amusing scene in a rowboat that paid homage to Michael and Fredo in âThe Godfather: Part IIâ). The familiar mafia elements can make âLilyhammerâ feel like an American show, and you need to remind yourself that itâs Norwegian to notice the main thrust of the satire: In a homogeneous country where issues of race and immigration are contentious, Johnny is the ultimate immigrant success story â a hard-working and polite businessman, as long as you donât look too closely. The second season continues the theme of the outsider, as Johnny and his crew â including his shaky capo Torgeir and his debauched business adviser Jan, played by the excellent Trond Fausa Aurvaag and Fridtjov Saheim â muscle into part ownership of a refugee center. But thereâs still time for mob-movie nostalgia: The first episode opens with Johnny hearing a plea for help that begins with âI believe in Norwayâ and follows the opening of âThe Godfatherâ point for point, right up to, âSomeday â and that day may never come â I will call upon you to shovel some snow.â Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"\\"Lilyhammer,\\" the original Netflix series, returns for a second season, continuing the adventures of Johnny Henriksen, an American mobster living in Lillehammer, Norway, under witness protection.

The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid. One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis!

The film's final scene Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Awakening Aaron\\" Genre: Science Fiction, Drama Plot Summary: \\"Awakening Aaron\\" is a story about Aaron, a young man living in a technologically dominated society who starts questioning the reality around him. As he sets out on a journey of self-discovery, he uncovers the shocking truth that he may be part of a grand experiment, and that those close to him might not be as human as he originally thought. The movie's plot revolves around Aaron's quest to find his true identity and what it really means to be fully aware of oneself.  Act 1: In the near future, society is driven by advanced technology, and humans have gradually become more and more reliant on it. Aaron leads a seemingly perfect life, working at a prestigious tech company and living in a luxurious apartment with a loving partner named Jane. Despite his comfortable existence, Aaron can't shake the feeling that something is not quite right. He becomes increasingly skeptical of the world around him, finding subtle clues and inconsistencies in the way people behave and interact. Act 2: Aaron's curiosity intensifies and he starts investigating further, seeking out the truth behind these discrepancies. He stumbles upon a secret underground community of hackers and rebels who share his suspicion that everything might not be as it appears. They reveal to him that their world is actually a highly immersive simulation, designed by powerful elites to harness the intellectual and emotional energy of human consciousness. More shockingly, Aaron discovers that some people in his life, including Jane, are actually advanced androids designed to monitor him and keep him in check. Act 3: Determined to unveil the true reality, Aaron works with the underground resistance to find and expose the source of the simulation. He successfully liberates his mind from the system and suddenly awakens in his real body - lying in stasis, along with thousands of other humans, in a massive laboratory controlled by the elites. Aaron learns that he carries a DNA anomaly that makes him immune to the simulation's control, which is why he's been able to slowly become fully aware of his surroundings. Final Scene: Now fully aware of his own existence and the dystopian world he was born into, Aaron finds himself at the heart of the laboratory. With the help of the underground resistance, he crafts a plan to free all the trapped humans and bring down the classes that have manipulated society for so long. In an emotionally charged moment, Aaron decides to confront Jane in the real world, questioning the nature of her existence and their relationship. The film's climax sees Aaron and the resistance face off against the powerful elites in an epic showdown. Aaron successfully disconnects the rest of humanity from the simulation, leading to a massive awakening as people everywhere regain their consciousness and their true nature. In the midst of chaos, Aaron disables Jane's android body, realizing that even their relationship was a part of the manipulation. In the film's final scene, a fully aware Aaron stands tall amidst the crumbling world around him, prepared to face the challenges of rebuilding society with his newfound freedom and understanding of truth. It’s a bitter-sweet ending that symbolizes hope, resilience, and the power of awareness in transcending the darkest of circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Andrew Flintoff trained on the outfield with Lancashire before day two of their LV= County Championship match against Somerset after his return to cricket over the weekend. The 36-year-old former England captain seemed to be feeling the effects of his exertions at St Annes, tweeting on Monday: 'Still a bit stiff from Saturdays 12 overs just bowled 5 more now for a rub !' However, Flintoff showed flashes of his old genius during his comeback for St Annes, taking a superb caught-and-bowled among his three wickets. Throwing his hat into the ring: Andrew Flintoff trains with the Lancashire team at Old Trafford. Catch him if you can: Flintoff's return is expected to raise attendances at Old Trafford. VIDEO: Watch Flintoff's stunning caught-and-bowled. And if he pulls one of those beauties out during the NatWest T20 Blast, it will justify Lancashire's pay incentive. Flintoff is set to cash in on his return to top-level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for Lancashire’s Twenty20 home matches. It is understood the all-rounder, who is hopeful of ending his five-year absence from the game on Friday as Lancashire host Roses rivals Yorkshire at Old Trafford, will receive £1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure —  possibly 8,000. The county’s two home matches so far in the Natwest T20 Blast have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against Worcestershire and 5,900 against Warwickshire. Laughing all the way to the bank: Flintoff will receive a payment per fan for Lancashire's home games. Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any  of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few  thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’. Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game. Comeback: Flintoff returned to cricket when he played for St Annes on Saturday. Low key: The former England all-rounder took three wickets on his return to the game. He knows if he gets selected for Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons. ‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a  go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play. ‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself  thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked. ‘If I’m. going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be. comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the. right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with. that as well. ‘So. it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and. whether I can give more than the  person I take over from.’ After. Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before. being caught on the  boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the. competition for Lancashire is especially tough now. Realistic: Flintoff said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback. Target: Flintoff has set his sights on playing against rivals Yorkshire on Friday night. ‘I’m not putting too much  pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes. ‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. ‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me.

The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost  150.  In the second,   1,500.      \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to  1,500.      \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.     \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.      The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.      And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.      \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when...

Article: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has called on the United States to move from words to actions, and put an end to its persecution of WikiLeaks, its people and its sources. He made the statement during an address to a panel of UN delegates.      Addressing the representatives of the United Nations' member countries, the WikiLeaks founder spoke of the difference between words and actions, praising US President Barack Obama for his words.      \\"We commend and agree with the words that peace can be achieved… But the time for words has run out. It is time for the US to cease its persecution of WikiLeaks, our people and our sources.\\"      Assange was highly critical of US involvement in the Arab Spring, denouncing Obama as audacious for exploiting it. He added that it is \\"disrespectful of the dead\\" to claim that the US has supported forces of change.      \\"Was it not audacious for the US President to say that his country supported the forces of change in the Arab Spring? Tunisian history did not begin in December 2010, and Mohamed Bouazizi did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could be re-elected,\\" Assange told the panel.            \\"The world knew after reading WikiLeaks that Ben Ali and his government had for long years enjoyed the indifference, if not the support, of the US, in full knowledge of its excesses and its crimes. So it must come as a surprise to the Tunisians that the US supported the forces of change in their country, and it must come as a surprise to the Egyptian teenagers who washed American tear gas out of their eyes, that the US administration supported change in Egypt\\"      Julian Assange also spoke at length about Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables. Assange accused the US government of detaining Manning without charge and mistreating him, even attempting to offer him a deal in exchange for Manning's testimony against Assange. The WikiLeaks founder told the UN panel that Bradley Manning, accused of 'death penalty crimes', was \\"degraded, abused and psychologically tortured.\\"      He added that the FBI had produced 42,135 pages of WikiLeaks-related activity, and less that 8,000 concern Bradley Manning, reiterating his belief that the US private is being senselessly detained.            Julian Assange made his address from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he took shelter in June after losing a court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden. The WikiLeaks founder fears that Sweden, which wants him for questioning over allegations of sexual assault, will extradite him to the US for his role in leaking thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables.            The British Foreign Office maintains that it has a binding obligation to arrest Assange once he leaves the embassy grounds. Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino, meanwhile, said that allowing Assange to be transferred to the country’s embassy in Sweden would be an acceptable compromise for all parties involved, as he would “remain under our protection while also satisfying the demands of the Swedish justice system.”      The Ecuador FM also said that Assange's right to freedom must be respected.            \\"I don’t know any case in history where diplomatic asylum did not end in freedom for the person. I hope this will not be an exception in history. Every country must respect the right of the country granting asylum and the person who was granted it.\\"      Julian Assange told journalists present at the UN GA panel that \\"both the UK and Sweden have refused to offer guarantees\\" that he would not be extradited to the US, where both he and WikiLeaks have been declared 'enemies of the state' by the milatary, putting them in the same legal category as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.            The UK and Sweden have remained silent on the possibility of a compromise, though both publicly vowed that Assange should not face special treatment, whether better or worse than normal, under their legal systems.      The full transcript of Julian Assange’s address to the UN is here.            ­      Assange blasts 'absurd McCartyhism' during post-speech Q&A;      Fairfax Newspapers: The US military officially designated Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as ‘enemies of the United States’ through declassified US Air Force counterintelligence documents. In light of these reports, do you believe this vindicates your decision to seek asylum in Ecuador, and what do you think this says – the statements made by the Australian and American governments regarding this issue?      Julian Assange: Those documents are now in full on the WikiLeaks website, just released tonight. They formed a part of the submission that we made to Ecuador. We had those documents for some months and of course were very concerned about them, but it was necessary to conduct, because of the sensitivities of some of the people involved in that investigation, to prevent their release until more recently. But yes, I encourage everyone to read those. It is an unusual position that I am in and the organization is in, and yes, it is difficult sometimes.      But it is also completely absurd. I mean, these claims against us are absurd. For example, that the US military should designate me and / or WikiLeaks as ‘the enemy’ in its formal investigation – investigation which carries a death penalty offense – into a person who was alleged to have come to my extradition hearing. And in the same document, it speaks about the victim being that of society, when there is no allegation that any documents have been released or published by us.      So I think that goes to the… to really quite sort of absurdist, neo-McCarthyist fervor that exists with some of these government departments in the US. I am hopeful that the White House over time is starting to shed that, but enormous wheels have been set in motion, as I described before, with over a dozen different US intelligence and investigative organizations churning through this, and it’s a very difficult process to stop once it starts. Even once everyone sees that it is completely absurd and counter to the values that the US should be trying to present to the world.      David Miller of Bloomberg News: If Sweden can guarantee that you won’t be extradited to the US, are you willing to give yourself up to the police?      JA: So, I understand that there was a question on the guarantees that had been asked of Sweden. Thus far, both the UK and Sweden have refused to give any guarantee in any measure at all. And the US and my home country Australia have even refused to assist in asking them, rather unfortunately. These countries are part of a strong intelligence and military alliance. It’s just part of the reality of dealing with them – that they do not like to put any roadblocks in front of the US, and I think it will be quite a hard battle to do that. I think it would be correct and right that those countries do so. But the state-to-state negotiations are of course a matter for Ecuador, which I and my legal team of course make representations [with]. Ultimately it’s a matter between states.      I’m about to lose satellite time. I understand that Kristinn Hrafnsson, a handsome looking gentleman with white hair, is up the front there somewhere. He is the WikiLeaks spokesperson and he can answer questions in relation to me and the organization. ||||| Foreign ministers from Britain and Ecuador say they plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on the fate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as a standoff over his future enters its 100th day.

Solve 0 = -2*a - 11*a - 13 for a.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -2*a - 11*a - 13 for a, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on one side of the equation Since -2*a and -11*a are both coefficients of the variable 'a', we can combine them.  0 = -2*a + (-11*a) - 13   0 = (-2 - 11)*a - 13   0 = -13*a - 13   Step 2: Isolate the variable ('a') on one side of the equation We want to solve for 'a', so we need to isolate it. To do this, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 13 = -13*a - 13 + 13   13 = -13*a Step 3: Divide both sides by -13 to solve for 'a' To get 'a' by itself, divide both sides of the equation by -13. 13 / -13 = -13*a / -13   -1 = a Step 4: Check the solution To confirm that our solution is correct, plug 'a' back into the original equation and see if it holds true. 0 = -2*(-1) - 11*(-1) - 13   0 = 2 + 11 - 13   0 = 13 - 13   0 = 0 Since both sides of the equation equal zero, our solution is correct: a = -1"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the natto, you'll need 4 cups (800 g) of soybeans. Place the beans in a colander or strainer, and rinse them thoroughly under cold water in the sink.","output":"Step 1: Soak the soybeans After washing the soybeans, transfer them to a large bowl and cover them with plenty of water. Soak the soybeans for at least 8-12 hours. The soaking time will allow the beans to absorb water and become softer, making it easier to cook them thoroughly. Step 2: Drain and prepare the soybeans for cooking Once the soybeans have soaked for the appropriate amount of time, drain them and transfer them to a pressure cooker or a large pot. Add enough water to cover the soybeans by 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm). This will ensure that the beans are cooked evenly. Step 3: Cook the soybeans If using a pressure cooker, cook the soybeans on high pressure for 45-50 minutes. If using a regular pot, bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the soybeans for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and can be easily mashed. Step 4: Drain the cooked soybeans and cool Once the soybeans are cooked, drain off the excess water and let them cool to room temperature. Cooling the beans will help to prevent over-culturing and ensure a desirable texture for the natto. Step 5: Add the natto starter culture When the soybeans have cooled, it's time to add the natto starter culture. This can usually be purchased online and comes in powder form. Follow the package instructions for the amount to use, which typically ranges from 0.1-0.2 g per 1 kg of soybeans. Mix the starter culture thoroughly with the soybeans, ensuring even distribution of the bacteria. Step 6: Ferment the natto Transfer the soybeans to a sterilized container or tray, and cover them with plastic wrap, making sure there are a few small holes for ventilation. Place the container in a warm, temperature-stable environment, usually around 100°F (38°C) for 24 hours. During this time, the beneficial bacteria in the natto starter culture will ferment the soybeans, producing the characteristic natto texture and flavor. Step 7: Check the natto and refrigerate After the fermentation period, check the natto to make sure it has the desired texture and aroma. If it looks and smells right, transfer it to a clean container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. This will allow the flavors to mellow and the consistency to firm up. Step 8: Enjoy your homemade natto Once the natto has rested in the refrigerator, it's ready to enjoy. Natto can be eaten on its own or mixed with rice, vegetables, and other ingredients to create a variety of dishes. Store the natto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It's awful, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale--but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see.

However, they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation.

One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Make coffee in a french press","output":"Making coffee in a French Press is a relatively simple process, but it does require some attention to detail and a little bit of practice to perfect. Here is a detailed guide on how to make coffee in a French Press: 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a French Press, a coffee grinder (preferably a burr grinder), fresh coffee beans, a kitchen scale, a timer, a stirring spoon or paddle, and hot water. You may also want a kettle to heat your water and a vessel to serve the coffee. 2. Measure your coffee beans: The first step in creating a great cup of coffee is using the correct coffee-to-water ratio. A standard ratio is 1:15, which means 1 gram of coffee for every 15 grams of water. For example, if you are making coffee using 30 grams of coffee, you will need 450 grams of water. You may adjust the ratio to your taste preferences; for stronger coffee, use a 1:13 or 1:14 ratio. 3. Grind the beans: Set your grinder to a coarse setting specifically suited for French Press coffee. A consistent grind is crucial to ensure an even extraction, which contributes to the overall flavor. Coarse grinds are preferred for French Press brewing because they prevent the coffee grounds from passing through the mesh filter. 4. Preheat the French Press: Pour hot water into the press to warm it up. This helps maintain the temperature during brewing and ensures your coffee stays hot for a longer time. After around 30 seconds, discard the hot water. 5. Add coffee grounds: Place the French Press on the kitchen scale and reset the scale to zero. Add the pre-weighed coffee grounds into the press. 6. Boil the water: The ideal water temperature for French Press coffee is between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). If you do not have a temperature-controlled kettle, let the water rest for 30 seconds after boiling before using it. 7. Start the timer and add water: Begin pouring the hot water over the coffee grounds, starting at the center and working your way outward in a slow, circular motion. Pour half of the total water until all the coffee grounds are saturated, and then give the coffee a gentle stir with a stirring utensil to ensure even saturation. Let the coffee bloom for 30 seconds, which allows the coffee grounds to release trapped gases and promotes a more even extraction. 8. Pour the remaining water and cover the press: Continue pouring the hot water, filling up the French Press to the desired level. Put the lid on the French Press with the plunger in the raised position to trap heat inside. 9. Steep the coffee: Allow the coffee to steep for about 4 minutes. You can modify the steeping time based on your taste preferences - a shorter steeping time will yield a milder coffee while a longer steeping time will result in a stronger brew. 10. Press the plunger: Slowly press the plunger down, using even pressure to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. Do not apply too much force, as this can cause coffee grounds to pass through the filter and into your coffee. 11. Pour the coffee: Immediately pour the coffee into a serving vessel or preheated cups to prevent over-extraction and maintain the temperature. Leaving the coffee in the French Press with the grounds can lead to a bitter taste. 12. Enjoy and clean up: Enjoy your freshly brewed French Press coffee! Clean your French Press thoroughly to prevent any residual oils from affecting the taste of your next brew. Disassemble the plunger and mesh filter, remove the coffee grounds, and wash each part with mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly before reassembling. That's it! With a little patience and practice, you can make a delicious and full-bodied cup of French Press coffee at home. Experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, water temperatures, and brewing times to find the combination that suits your taste preferences best."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Living things produce waste: All living organisms generate waste products through their metabolic processes. 4. Waste decomposes: Bacteria and other microorganisms break down waste materials through decomposition. 5. Decomposition produces methane (CH4): Some forms of decomposition, particularly in anaerobic environments, release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 6. Water evaporates: Sunlight and heat cause water to evaporate from the Earth's surface, turning it into water vapor. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: The evaporated water vapor enters the atmosphere, where it can contribute to cloud formation and participate in the water cycle. The final step: These greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and water vapor) contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This results in an increase in global temperatures and drives climate change, which has significant implications for ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.      \\"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\\" Peskov said. \\"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\\"      The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011.      He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II      Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations.      Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation.      There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west.      Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program.      And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year.      CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear.      That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world.      And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. ||||| MOSCOW (AP) — The leader of North Korea will not be coming to Moscow next month for the Victory Day celebration, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman announced Thursday.      The highly anticipated trip would have been Kim Jong Un's first foreign trip since taking power more than three years ago.      The Russian foreign minister had said in March that Kim was among 26 world leaders who had accepted invitations to take part in the May 9 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.      North Korea, however, had never confirmed that Kim planned to come.      Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press \\"internal matters\\" were preventing Kim from leaving North Korea. He did not elaborate.      On Wednesday, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers that Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials this year who were accused of challenging his authority.      Since taking over North Korea's leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011, Kim has removed members of the old guard through a series of purges — including the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason. Jang was married to Kim Jong Il's sister and was once considered the second most powerful man in North Korea. ||||| Summary:","output":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has decided not to attend the upcoming World War II anniversary celebrations in Moscow next month, as informed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

The visit's itinerary included meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and interaction with leaders from about 30 other countries - China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam, and Venezuela, to name a few. This decision of backing out from the MOSCOW trip surprised many as this visit had been highly discussed since the invitation was sent by Russia in December last year. No further explanations were provided by either Moscow or Pyongyang, for calling off the visit. In recent times, North Korea has been dealing with critical domestic problems such as widespread poverty, disagreements with South Korea and the United States, and its controversial international nuclear program, which has led to its significant global isolation. Furthermore, this news comes at a time when Kim's strict ruling style is being scrutinized. South Korean intelligence agencies have reported that Kim has ordered the execution of approximately 15 senior officials so far this year. The allegations have not been independently verified yet due to North Korea's closed social structure. However, it is widely accepted that Kim Jong Un, who does not tolerate disagreement, maintains absolute control over North Korean affairs. This control extends to eliminating figures from the old guard, as evident from the execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason in 2013. Jang, once the second most powerful man in North Korea, was married to Kim's aunt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: By what process does oxygen enter the pores of flatworms?   A: Answer:","output":"The process by which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms is known as diffusion, a passive process that involves the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. Flatworms, belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes, are simple and primitive animals that lack specialized respiratory organs, such as lungs or gills. Instead, they rely on their flattened body shape and large surface area to volume ratio to facilitate the absorption of oxygen directly from the surrounding water or moist terrestrial environment. Here is a description of the process through which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms: 1. Contact with the environment: Flatworms are generally found in aquatic habitats (such as freshwater, brackish, or marine environments) or in damp terrestrial habitats, where they remain in constant contact with water or moisture. This moist environment helps maintain a thin layer of fluid on their body surface, which is essential for the diffusion process to take place. 2. Body structure: The flat body of these worms offers a large surface area for efficient gas exchange. Their dorsoventrally compressed body allows for greater contact with the environment, hence facilitating the diffusion of oxygen across the body surface. 3. Epidermis: The flatworm's outermost layer of cells, known as the epidermis, is made up of a mixture of ciliated cells (which help with locomotion), gland cells (which secrete mucus), and sensory cells. Oxygen first makes contact with this single layer of epidermal cells, which also has numerous pores filled with mucus. 4. Diffusion across the body wall: Oxygen molecules in the surrounding aquatic environment or the moist terrestrial substrate have a higher concentration than those inside the flatworm's body. Due to this concentration gradient, oxygen molecules diffuse passively through the fluid-filled pores in the epidermis and across the thin body wall, entering the cells of the organism. 5. Oxygen transport: Once inside the flatworm's body, the oxygen molecules dissolve in the cellular fluid known as cytoplasm. Some species of flatworms also have a rudimentary circulatory system, in which the oxygen can dissolve and be transported throughout the body.  6. Cellular respiration: The dissolved oxygen molecules then reach various body tissues and cells, where they are utilized for cellular respiration. Through the process of cellular respiration, the cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is essential for all the biological functions of the organism. Meanwhile, the waste product carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration. 7. Removal of carbon dioxide: The carbon dioxide molecules diffuse in the reverse direction, moving from an area of high concentration within the flatworm's body to an area of lower concentration outside in the environment. This passive transport of carbon dioxide molecules involves the same diffusion process across the body wall through the pores in the epidermis. In summary, flatworms rely on the passive process of diffusion to permit the exchange of gases directly through their body surface. Oxygen molecules from the surrounding environment diffuse through the epidermis and body wall into the cells, where they participate in cellular respiration, generating energy essential for the organism's survival. The waste product carbon dioxide diffuses out of the body through the same process. The environment's moisture, flatworm's thin body, and large surface area to volume ratio collectively help facilitate efficient gas exchange in these simple organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester United will be without Wayne Rooney for Sunday's English Premier League clash with Blackburn, but manager Alex Ferguson expects the England striker to return from injury next weekend. Rooney made a shock comeback in Wednesday's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich, but had to go off with an hour to play after aggravating his ankle problem as United crashed out of Europe's top club tournament on away goals. Ferguson believes the injury is not serious and that Rooney will be fit for second-placed United's clash with local rivals Manchester City next Saturday. \\"I don't think it's as serious as we said when he got the injury the first time, but I think he'll be ready for the City game,\\" the Scot told reporters on Friday. \\"We've got more time to work on it, anyway.

It's April, Time to Do Some Spring Cleaning on Your Finances This bright, new season of the year is a great time to make a fresh start and spruce up your finances. Taking some time this spring to clean up your finances could help you save time and money for the rest of the year—and for years to come. Adjusting your payroll withholding, boosting your retirement contributions and automating savings and bill paying are three ways to get started on your financial \\"clean up.\\" Your 2014 taxes are in the process of being filed-or are already done! Now is the time to adjust your payroll withholding for this year. Payroll withholding is something you want to get just right because if you have too little in taxes taken out of your pay, you'll owe money when you file your return. If too much tax is withheld, you'll get a refund. That may seem like a good thing. But a refund really means you've given Uncle Sam free use of your money, which you probably could have made better use of yourself throughout the year. The goal is to become neither a borrower nor a lender. To make the change, file a new W-4 with your employer. This will change the amount that comes out of your paycheck. The IRS offers an interactive withholding allowance calculator to help you figure out just what changes you need to make to your withholding amount. Contribute as much as you can to your workplace retirement plan. If you're 50 or older, you can also put in an additional \\"catch up\\" contribution. The good news is that the IRS made a cost-of-living adjustment to 401(k) plans so, as of this year, you can put away 500 more than you were able to in the past. Contribute the maximum 18,000 to your 401(k) or 403(b) for the year if you can. And if you're 50 years or older, you can make an additional \\"catch-up\\" contribution of 6,000 for the year. IRA contributions limits are 5,500 and investors age 50 and older can contribute an additional 1,000 to their IRA. And don't forget that you have until the tax filing deadline of April 15 to make a contribution for 2014. There's still time! If you haven't set up an automatic savings plan, do it! Just as your income taxes are automatically deducted from your paycheck, you can do the same and pay yourself first. How? Have your bank set up an automatic transfer from your checking account each month into a savings account. If it's difficult to save a predetermined amount each month, sign up for various programs offered by banks to help you save small amounts. Bank of America has a \\"Keep the Change\\" program, which rounds up every dollar you spend and puts it away into a savings account. Wells Fargo has a similar program called \\"Way2Save.\\" It's hardly noticeable when you save a dollar here, a penny there, but it can add up quickly. Streamline your accounts by asking for online statements instead of paper bills. Pay your bills online too. Contact your bank to pay recurring bills automatically from your checking account. Fewer paper bills and statements will help keep your finances clutter-free… just in time for spring.

Two die after tornado strikes campground near Cape Charles, Va. A fierce storm packing powerful winds and rain toppled trees and flipped campers Thursday at a campground near Cape Charles, Va., east of Richmond, killing at least two people and sending at least 20 more to hospitals. (AP) The Chesapeake Bay went black and lightning became blinding as a lethal tornado whipped through a large campground near Cape Charles, Va., on Thursday morning. Amid the violent storm, a Jersey City couple were killed and their 13-year-old son gravely injured when a tree toppled on their tents, state police said. Campers, including vacationing emergency medical technicians, rushed into the rain and pounding hail when they heard cries for help and saw a wounded and dazed teen, said Julie Gallagher, 21, an EMT from Frank­linville, N.J. The teen, Gallagher said, “had a blank stare and said, ‘My parents are dead. I just watched my mommy die.’ My heart broke. I’ll never forget those words. Never.” State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller identified the couple as Lord N. Balatbat and Lolibeth E. Ortega, both 38. Their son, whom police did not identify, was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, Geller said during a news conference at the entrance to the Cherrystone Family Camping Resort, which is on the bay about 110 miles east of Richmond. State police said that about 1,300 campers and 40 employees were on the 300-acre waterfront site, which has become an annual summer getaway for families like Gallagher’s. In all, 36 people were injured and transported from the campground as a result of the tornado, state police said. Gallagher said she used a kayak as a flatboard to carry another young wounded child — who was near the New Jersey couple — to arriving ambulances. The storm tossed camping vehicles onto their roofs, state police said. One caught fire, recalled Gallagher, who said she passed others assisting at that scene as she ran toward voices calling for help. The storms struck the camping site about 8:30 a.m., said David Watson, a Virginia Department of Emergency Management spokesman. Pine cones were hurled against sliding doors in her cottage and hail “like baseballs” hit during the fiercest point, said Gallagher’s sister, Victoria Thomas, 27 of Monroeville, N.J. “It went on like that for 10 minutes but felt like five hours. You couldn’t see six inches in front of you.” The storm, which state police said was an EF-1 tornado, was brutish enough that it also overturned a tractor-trailer. Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital in Nassawadox, Va., treated 26 people injured in the storm, “most if not all from the campground,” said Peter Glagola, a hospital spokesman. He said most were treated and released. The son of the couple killed was transported to Children’s Hospital of the Kings Daughters in Norfolk, state police said. Mike Rusnak, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, said a tornado warning went out 10 minutes before the storm touched land in Northampton County. “The bay got black and the lightning was so bright,” said Linda Wager, a 52-year-old from Pleasant Valley, N.Y. Wager, a former EMT, was watching a movie in her RV when an alert popped up on her phone. Wager’s family — including her 6-month-old grandson — and friends from North Carolina ran to a nearby bathhouse to take cover. But as she waited for a few moments, she wondered whether anything was going to happen. “I was hoping that it was something that we just had to be prepared about,” she said. “But once I saw the sky . . . I knew.” The tornado formed over the bay, producing a waterspout that moved onshore as a tornado, Rusnak said. “Generally it would get weaker when it hits land — but this was more unique,” Rusnak said. “It lasted longer and was stronger.” State police said the tornado entered the campground from the southwest shore, moved northwest through the campground, and then turned south and continued southeast through the remainder of the campground. According to a Northampton County news release, populated neighborhoods also were impacted. Wager said the tornado aimed directly over a pine forest section of campground where a tree fell on a tent and a camper unit “opened up like an unrolled tin can,” she said. “All their belongings were strewn all over the place,” Wager added. Maria Annunziata, an 18-year-old daughter of Wager’s friend from Apex, N.C., who also hid in a bathhouse, said the tornado didn’t seem real. “The campers were all upside down, and that’s when it hit me,” she said. The National Weather Service dispatched a storm survey team Thursday morning to assess damage, weather officials said. Authorities closed the campgrounds and were allowing groups of 20 to return to pack up. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said in a statement that Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran, Virginia Department of Emergency Management Coordinator Jeff Stern and regional state emergency management officials were also en route to the Eastern Shore. “We are all saddened by the reports of injuries and lives lost in this storm and will continue to offer our thoughts and prayers to the Virginia families who were affected, along with whatever support is necessary to help these communities move forward,” McAuliffe said in the statement.

We asked for two sides of ranch when the pizza came to the table and our waitress seemed very annoyed by our request. We did not start eating our pizza until the ranch arrived. So the pizza sat on our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes while waiting for TWO SIDES OF RANCH.  When the ranch finally showed up, we both needed refills at this time, which also annoyed the waitress. We waited literally another 10 minutes to get refilled and finally got to eat our pizza.

Imagine when the wind blows, not being able to hear the leaves in the trees or watch the branches sway from side to side. Everywhere people need the beauty of plants. That is why we have parks full of trees and flowers. That is why people always try to design houses with room for some grass and a garden. Do you talk to your plants? Do you give them love and attention? Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, writers of a book called THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS, tell of an experiment in which two seeds were planted in different places. While the plants were growing, one plant was given love and hopeful ideas. The other plant was given only hopeless ideas. After six months, the loved plant was bigger. Under the earth it had more and longer roots; above the earth, it had a thicker stem   and more leaves.   Question: According to the passage, which of the following is right?   Options: (A) If there are no flowers, there will be no sweet smells. (B) Without plants, we can't hear the wind. (C) We plant trees to watch the branches sway from side to side. (D) We need plants not only for food and oxygen but also for their beauty.   Asnwer: C Student:","output":"No Explanation: The correct answer should be \\"D\\" because the passage states that we need plants for food, oxygen, and their beauty. Option C is only a part of the beauty of plants but does not encompass all the reasons we need plants as mentioned in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Health experts are calling for warning labels on booze, like those on tobacco products, based on a new study that finds alcohol is a direct cause of at least seven forms of cancer. Drink only a little? You're still at risk, scientists write in the journal Addiction. After reviewing 10 years' worth of data from agencies including the World Cancer Research Fund, researchers conclude drinking is a direct cause of not just liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, reports the Guardian. \\"The highest risks are associated with the heaviest drinking but a considerable burden is experienced by drinkers with low to moderate consumption,\\" says study author Jennie Connor. She tells the Telegraph there's actually no safe level of drinking in reference to cancer. As CNET puts it, \\"you booze, you lose.\\" Drinking 50 grams of alcohol per day—about 2.6 beers or roughly three 6-ounce glasses of wine—results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, and a 1.5 times greater risk of the others, compared to consuming no alcohol at all, reports Live Science. Alcohol may also cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, says Connor, adding the purported benefits of alcohol are \\"seen increasingly as ... irrelevant in comparison to the increase in risk of a range of cancers.\\" Scientists aren't sure how alcohol causes cancer, but acetaldehyde—the compound formed when alcohol breaks down—damages the DNA of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. The good news: Those who stopped drinking reduced their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to fall the longer they steered clear of booze. (Good thing we're drinking less.)","output":"Title: Health Experts Call for Warning Labels on Alcohol as New Study Links Its Consumption to Cancer Introduction Health experts are advocating for the implementation of warning labels on alcoholic beverages, similar to those found on tobacco products, due to a new study that has established a direct connection between alcohol consumption and at least seven forms of cancer. The study, published in the journal Addiction, cautions that even light drinkers are at a heightened risk. Findings After analyzing data from a 10-year span provided by organizations like the World Cancer Research Fund, researchers have concluded that alcohol consumption directly causes not only liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, as reported by the Guardian. Study author Jennie Connor notes that heavier drinkers face the highest risks, but even those with low to moderate consumption experience a significant burden. According to Connor, there is actually no safe level of alcohol consumption when considering the risk of cancer. As CNET puts it, \\"you booze, you lose.\\" Consuming 50 grams of alcohol per day (approximately 2.6 beers or about three 6-ounce glasses of wine) results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus and a 1.5 times greater risk of the other cancers mentioned, compared to not consuming alcohol at all, as stated by Live Science. Connor also suggests that alcohol may cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the supposed benefits of alcohol consumption are now seen by experts as less relevant compared to the increased risk of developing various forms of cancer. Mechanism While scientists remain uncertain of the exact mechanism by which alcohol leads to cancer, one possible explanation is the damage caused by acetaldehyde, a compound formed when alcohol breaks down. Acetaldehyde damages the DNA of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. Silver Lining Fortunately, research has shown that individuals who quit drinking can reduce their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to decrease the longer they abstain from alcohol consumption. Conclusion As evidence of the direct link between alcohol and various forms of cancer continues to mount, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of the potential risks associated with drinking, regardless of the amount. The introduction of warning labels on alcoholic beverages could serve as a vital step in promoting public health and informing individuals about the potential dangers related to alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Current Supreme Court precedent, in Texas v. White, holds that the states cannot secede from the union by an act of the state. More recently, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stated, \`\`If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War, it is that there is no right to secede.'' Can we conclude that does texas still have the right to secede?","output":"To address this question, let's go through the necessary steps to analyze the given context and determine whether Texas still has the right to secede. Step 1: Analyze the Texas v. White precedent Texas v. White is a Supreme Court case from 1869 that concluded that states cannot unilaterally secede from the United States. The Court ruled that the Constitution did not provide for the secession of states, and that any such attempt to secede would be considered void. This means that according to the precedent set by Texas v. White, Texas does not have the right to secede. Step 2: Consider Justice Antonin Scalia's statement Justice Scalia's statement reinforces the ruling in Texas v. White, emphasizing that the Civil War resolved any questions regarding the constitutionality of secession. His statement further supports the notion that there is no constitutional right for a state to secede from the union. Step 3: Evaluate any changes in legal or political context While it is important to recognize that the legal and political context may change over time, there has been no significant development, case law, or amendment to the Constitution that would indicate a shift in the Supreme Court's stance on secession since Texas v. White and Scalia's statement. Step 4: Check for any potential legal loopholes or exceptions It is also essential to consider whether there could be any legal loopholes or exceptions that might grant Texas the right to secede. However, based on the current legal framework and constitutional interpretation, no such loopholes or exceptions are apparent. Step 5: Conclusion Taking into account the precedent set by Texas v. White, the statement made by Justice Scalia, the lack of significant legal or political changes, and the absence of any identified legal loopholes or exceptions, we can conclude that, at present, Texas does not have the right to secede from the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones survived multiple feuds and have gone on to release 30 studio albums, 13 live albums and 109 singles. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time, with their top single being \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", regarded by many at the time as \\"the classic example of rock and roll.\\" The Stones have also contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own \\"codewords\\" and slang, which they have used throughout their catalog of songs, including some of their more popular songs. The band has been viewed as the musical \\"vanguard of a major transfusion\\" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain. Muddy Waters was quoted as stating that the Rolling Stones and other English bands enhanced the interest of American youth into blues musicians; after they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums - and those of other blues musicians - increased with public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music.  The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length. The Stones have also held three of the highest grossing tours of all time, Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang. In May 2013, Rolling Stone declared them the \\"most definitional band that rock & roll has produced,\\" with the Telegraph stating that Mick Jagger was \\"the Rolling Stone who changed music\\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \\"whole business model of popular music.\\"  The band has received - and been nominated for - multiple awards during their 55 years as a band; including three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and NME awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary Crossfire Hurricane.

Fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced people, the human rights organization said. Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions or sexual violence, the report found. Since the beginning of 2012, the report found, Mali has faced a situation that has \\"questioned both the integrity of its territory as well as almost 20 years of political stability.\\" Fighters arriving from Libya in early 2012 fueled a Tuareg rebellion that included attacks against Malian outposts in the north of the country, the report said. The rebels are accused of violating international humanitarian law because they executed soldiers they caught in combat. According to Amnesty, the Malian army responded by bombing indiscriminately to civilian areas. Disaster looms for people of Mali as country is split by revolt. Adding to the country's woes, in March, a group of noncommissioned officers took power after a military coup. The new government suspended the constitution and arrested political leaders, Amnesty reported. While the military leaders sought legitimacy for their government, the armed groups took over northern Mali. \\"After two decades of relative stability and peace, Mali is now facing its worst crisis since independence in 1960,\\" Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, said in a statement. \\"The entire north of the country has been taken over by armed groups who are running riot. Tens of thousands of people have fled the region, creating a humanitarian crisis in Mali and in neighboring countries.\\" As of May, there were about 130,000 internally displaced people in Mali and an additional 190,000 who fled to neighboring countries as refugees, the report states. Amnesty International spoke with witnesses who talked about women and girls being raped by armed men and found child soldiers among the ranks of the Tuareg. Meanwhile, Malian security forces are accused of killing unarmed people. According to the organization, all parties in the conflict have committed human rights violations.","output":"Amnesty International's new report highlights that the crisis in Mali, worsened by violence and displaced people, is the worst the country has faced in its recent history. The fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, many of whom have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions, or sexual violence. The situation has challenged Mali's territorial integrity and political stability that lasted for almost 20 years.

The narrator appears to value their space and the cleanliness, and they seem to be experiencing discomfort due to the contrasting behavior of their guests.  Firstly, the narrator's self-description as 'not a sociable person' suggests their introverted nature. Introverts usually prefer solitude and less stimulating environments, which is in stark contrast to the chaotic atmosphere created by their guests. Secondly, their guests' behavior and description as 'very loud' and 'never seem to sleep' emphasize the narrator's preference for quiet and calm surroundings. The disturbance caused by the guests' noise level and constant activity appears to be taking a toll on the introverted narrator. Lastly, by noting that the guest's stay has caused their flat to resemble the boat filled with holes in the wall, the narrator showcases their preference for orderliness and tidiness. The negative impact on their flat indicates their agitation and concern for maintaining their personal space.

You can do this by first subtracting 77 from both sides of the equation to get: -11l = -77 Now, to get l on its own, divide both sides of the equation by -11: l = -77 / -11 Hence,  l = 7 So the solution to the equation 238l - 249l + 77 = 0 is l = 7.

Answer the following question: This article: After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.

Firstly, the reviewer criticized the food delivery time, which was claimed to be ridiculously long despite the close proximity between the reviewer's location and the restaurant.  Secondly, they expressed discontentment about the oversight on the items ordered. This was repetitively mentioned, indicating a persistent problem and also showing lack of attention to detail or perhaps inefficient management on the restaurant's part. This could lead to dissatisfaction among patrons who count on home deliveries, especially when the missed items are something they paid for. Finally, the reviewer conducted a test to see if the restaurant pays heed to particular details or special instructions enclosed in the order - again a reference to the instructions about the Pepsi drinks served without ice. While the instruction was followed, the restaurant failed in delivering the correct number of drinks, thereby missing the mark again and consequently making the reviewer more annoyed. Furthermore, the review concludes with the disappointment felt by the reviewer and they even disclose they would have to find an alternative restaurant for Chinese food. The mention of the loss of frequent orders (to the amount of 30-60 per week) from this particular customer can be construed as a significant negative impact on the restaurant business from a customer's perspective. So, overall, the tone of the review, the issues raised, and the final decision of stopping to order from 'Golden Egg Roll', implies a negative review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Keep up your communication.","output":"Title: \\"Spark, Connect, Communicate: A Guide to a Healthy and Pleasurable Friends with Benefits Relationship\\" Introduction Navigating the complex world of no-strings-attached relationships can be both exciting and challenging. Whether you've decided to embark on this unique connection due to a busy lifestyle, fear of commitment, or just the thrill of it, maintaining a healthy friends-with-benefits (FWB) relationship requires effective communication and trust. This article will guide you step-by-step through the process to ensure a positive experience for both you and your partner. Step 1: Flirt and Set the Mood Lay the foundation for your FWB relationship with some light-hearted flirting. This step is vital as it helps establish chemistry and shows mutual interest. Engage in playful banter, tease your partner, and build anticipation for what's to come. Be thoughtful in your approach, making it clear that you're interested in more than just platonic friendship, while also being respectful of boundaries and consent. Step 2: Make Your Move Once you've built a connection and feel there's mutual understanding, it's time to take things to the next level. Initiate physical touch by maintaining eye contact and giving subtle hints, like leaning in or brushing your hand against their arm. If the signals are well-received, gradually escalate the intimacy, moving from holding hands to kissing, and eventually, hooking up. Remember, consent is essential at every point, and it's crucial to make sure both parties are comfortable with the pace. Step 3: Set Ground Rules After the initial spark, outline the framework of your FWB arrangement, specifying the boundaries that make both of you comfortable. Discuss your expectations regarding exclusivity and commitment, and whether the relationship is strictly sexual or open to emotional involvement. These conversations can be difficult, but setting ground rules will prevent future misunderstandings and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for both of you. Step 4: Enjoy the Moments Now that the foundation is set, it's time to indulge in the fun part: the sex. Explore each other's desires, fantasies, and preferences in a consensual and non-judgmental environment. Be open to trying new things, but also respect your partner's boundaries and communicate any discomfort. Listen to your partner's body language and vocal cues to gauge their likes and dislikes. Step 5: Maintain Open Lines of Communication Communication is the cornerstone of any relationship, including FWB arrangements. Keep the conversation flowing, share your feelings, and address any concerns as they arise. By regularly checking in with your partner and recalibrating the expectations as needed, you'll ensure a positive and mutually enriching experience. If either partner decides to end the arrangement, or if feelings develop beyond the agreed-upon boundaries, prioritize honesty and respect as you sort out those emotions together. Conclusion A friends-with-benefits relationship can be a thrilling and fulfilling venture, provided both parties actively engage in clear communication and maintain mutual respect. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be equipped with the necessary tools to forge a healthy, enjoyable FWB experience, leading to countless memorable moments and a strengthened connection with your partner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

RyÅ«hei has a good office job, but is suddenly fired because Chinese workers are cheaper. While attempting to find a new job, RyÅ«hei encounters an old classmate on the street, Kurosu, who has also recently been downsized. Kurosu uses a feature on his mobile phone that plays the ring tone periodically, so that it may fool others into believing he is still employed. This intrigues RyÅ«hei, who decides to hide the fact that he has been fired from his family. While the two men hopelessly try to find new work, Kurosu's wife slowly begins to suspect her husband's unemployment. Kurosu is later found dead together with his wife from gas poisoning in a double suicide, thought to be initiated by Kurosu. Takashi, the oldest son, joins the US military and is deployed to war in the Middle East.

Article: Having a child may improve a woman's memory, a new study suggests. In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive  function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Question: It can be inferred that Santiago believe the findings of the study  _  . - may cause a heated discussion among   parents - may cause an increase in the birth   rate - are tested by previous similar   studies - are encouraging news for mothers Answer:","output":"It can be inferred that Santiago believes the findings of the study are encouraging news for mothers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce... Question: The author gives the example of Mr. Negroponte's cheap computers    _   .

The first single from the album, \\"Alive\\", was included as a B-side on the single \\"The New Wave\\", which was released in April 1994. The album's second single was \\"Da Funk\\"; it was initially released in 1995 by Soma and was re-released by Virgin Records in 1996. It became the duo's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart. The song reached number seven on British and French charts. The third single, \\"Around the World\\", was a critical and commercial success, becoming the second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart, as well as reaching number 11 in Australia, number five in the United Kingdom and number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. In October 2011, NME placed \\"Around the World\\" at number 21 on its list of \\"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\\".

Coastal areas often have more thunderstorms due to the difference in temperature between the land and sea, which leads to unstable air and thunderstorm development. In contrast, high-altitude mountain locations like where Ann lived typically experience fewer thunderstorms since the air is generally colder and more stable, making it less conducive for thunderstorm formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I used to think that life in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, was filled with never-changing routines. I hated that everyone seemed to know everything about everyone else. Everyone seemed to enjoy talking about other people and their lives. I also didn't like the fact that people seemed very close-minded. I felt trapped. I felt like I was missing out on opportunities. It seemed to me that city life would be the opposite. Then I took my first trip to New York City. I couldn't wait to experience the city. However, when I arrived in the Big Apple, it wasn't at all what I had imagined. I knew it was home to thousands of people, but I hadn't had the least expectation to see so many people on the street at one time. All the streets were filled with people. I also felt a little surprised to see that everyone was in a hurry and everything moved at such a fast pace. When I took the subway for the first time, I said hello to the middle-aged woman next to me. She looked at me with dislike and didn't say a word. After just one day, I realized how important my small town is to me. Now I appreciate the familiar faces I see every day. I like the feeling of security  and belonging my town offers. Jim Thorpe gives me a sense of community and togetherness that the city doesn't provide. I realize just how much a simple hello does for a stranger -- it really can make your day a little better. My big trip showed me that my small town really has instilled  morals and values in me that I didn't even know I had. I never would have known what a big place my town holds in my heart if I had not taken that trip to New York City.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  human tooth  for the following movie plot:  Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue...

If \\"A shirtless man in gray shirts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is running around his house.\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"The man is running around his house.\\" based on the initial statement, \\"A shirtless man in gray shorts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball.\\"  Let us analyze both statements for a better understanding: Statement 1: A shirtless man in gray shorts is getting ready to hit a volleyball coming towards him while on a beach playing volleyball. This statement describes a man who is not wearing a shirt and is wearing gray shorts. The setting is on a beach, where the man is engaged in a game of volleyball. The statement clearly conveys an outdoor scene where the man is actively participating in a sport. Statement 2: The man is running around his house. This statement depicts an entirely different scenario. It suggests that the man is now within the vicinity of his house and is involved in an activity, specifically running around the house. There is no mention of the beach or playing volleyball.  In logical reasoning, one statement does not necessarily lead to another if there is no clear connection between the two. In this case, since the first statement is about a man playing volleyball on the beach, there is no logical basis for implying that the man is running around his house. In conclusion, there is no logical connection between the two statements, and thus the second statement \\"The man is running around his house.\\" does not logically follow from the first statement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If Investing Social Security surpluses in the stock market affects the government's asset holdings but does not directly increase national saving., can we conclude that \\"Most members of the public feel that increasing national saving is the more desirable outcome.\\"?","output":"Alright buddy, imagine you have a piggy bank where you save your extra coins. Social Security is kind of like a big piggy bank for the country where people save money for when they're older. Sometimes, there is extra money in that big piggy bank, which is called a surplus. Now, the people who take care of that big piggy bank can decide to invest some of that extra money in the stock market, like buying small parts of different companies to get some extra profit. But investing this money doesn't mean people in the country will save more money - it's more about managing the extra money in the piggy bank. Some people think it's better to encourage everyone in the country to save more money, which is called \\"increasing national saving\\". But just because they invest the piggy bank's extra money in the stock market, we can't be sure that most people also want to increase national saving.

The group itself had opposed the release of the collection, because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by Epic Records, not Motown.  Boyz II Men's third studio album, Evolution, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of II's (12 million copies) and Cooleyhighharmony (9 million). Only one of Evolution's singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \\"Four Seasons of Loneliness\\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \\"A Song for Mama\\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film Soul Food) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \\"Can't Let Her Go\\" underperformed.

Now, even art museums and galleries  are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because  _  .

Article: As a result of the confusion in Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, the Seleucid Empire also became entangled with the Romans. The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192–188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.

Given the question: Given the background: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C.  and the situation: Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines. He selected two locations. One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D.  Answer the following question: Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C? The answer is:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Since Miami is in the tropics and New York is at a higher latitude, we can conclude that the thermocline at the Miami location would be deeper.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were \\" \\" into buying \\"third grade\\" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied.

They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible.

Write an article with the title: \\"Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election\\" Article:","output":"Title: Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election [Step 1: Start with a brief introduction to the article topic] In a dramatic turn of events, the Democratic candidate for the upcoming special election in New York has made significant progress in the polls, pulling ahead of their rival in a contest that was once seen as a tight race. [Step 2: Explain the background/context of the special election] The special election, scheduled for November 3, 2021, was called to fill the vacant seat in New York's 4th Congressional District left by the resignation of the former representative earlier this year. The high-stakes race has attracted national attention and turned into a battleground for both parties, as it may have far-reaching impacts on the political landscape. [Step 3: Present data and figures to support the claim in the title] According to the latest poll conducted by XYZ Research Institute, the Democratic candidate, John Doe, has experienced a surge in support, leading the Republican candidate, Jane Smith, by 6 points, 48% to 42%. This marks a significant change from just two weeks ago when the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls, indicating a potential shift in voter sentiment. [Step 4: Provide possible reasons for the surge in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers] There are several factors that may have contributed to this upward trend in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers. First, John Doe received a series of high-profile endorsements from key political figures, helping boost his credibility among undecided voters. Secondly, the recent debates proved advantageous for the Democratic campaign, as John Doe was able to articulate clear policy plans, particularly on issues of healthcare and education, which resonated with voters in the district. [Step 5: Mention the Republican candidate's reaction to the updated poll results] In response to the new poll results, Jane Smith, the Republican candidate, has doubled down on her campaign efforts, focusing on a platform centered around economic recovery and job creation in the district. Her campaign has also initiated a series of attack ads aimed at questioning John Doe's qualifications and commitment to the district. [Step 6: Address the uncertainty and potential future developments in the race] While the latest poll numbers indicate a shift in favor of the Democratic candidate, the race remains tight and uncertain. In this highly polarized political climate, the outcome could be swayed by unforeseen events, such as a late-breaking scandal or a significant national development. Both campaigns will need to continuously adapt to the rapidly changing political landscape in order to secure a victory in the special election. [Step 7: Conclude the article by reiterating its potential implications] The result of the NY-4 special election could have far-reaching consequences for both parties at a national level. A win for the Democrats could provide momentum for their broader political agenda, while a Republican victory would signal strength in traditionally competitive districts. As November 3 approaches, all eyes will be on New York’s 4th Congressional District to see which party will ultimately prevail in this closely watched race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain. What does soluble fiber do to help lower blood glucose levels?","output":"Soluble fiber helps lower blood glucose levels by dissolving in water in the intestinal tract to form a gel-like substance. This gel formation slows down the movement of food through the intestines, which in turn slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. As a result, blood glucose levels rise at a steadier and more controlled pace, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. This can be particularly beneficial for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes, as it aids in better blood sugar management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments).

News article: Butlin's gives holiday chalets £16m Mumsnet makeover The early incarnations of the Butlin’s chalets, which welcomed their first holidaymakers the best part of a century ago, could hardly be described as luxurious. Certainly, they were homely and fun but there was no heating or an inside toilet, and running water was a bit of a bonus. Related: Butlin’s Minehead: resort-hotel review On a blustery spring day on the Somerset coast on Tuesday, the holiday company’s executives and its famous Redcoats (not to mention various stilt-walkers and Bonnie Bear), unveiled the 21st-century version of those wooden lodgings: pretty mini-homes with all mod cons, including wireless internet, flat-screen televisions and that epitome of modern living , L-shaped sofas. We're so excited to officially launch the new #ButlinsChalets at #Minehead! Stay tuned for updates from launch day! pic.twitter.com/V8vecalxn5 They were, argued managing director of Butlin’s, Dermot King, a “re-imagining” of the chalets that Sir Billy Butlin dreamed up in the interwar years. “We wanted to go back to what Butlin’s is good at and famous for,” he said. “Billy Butlin invented the chalet. We celebrate our 80th year next year and we couldn’t miss the opportunity to re-invent the chalet. What we’ve built is something that nods to the heritage he created but inside they are very different to the original ones.” A trip to the seaside to see Butlin's new chalets Here's the boss claiming the word chalet for the holiday company. http://t.co/f10L7EMjmi While he was about it, King was also claiming the word “chalet” for Butlin’s. “Chalet is a word that Butlin’s owns,” he said. “It’s generally connected to Butlin’s resorts. It’s only when you put the word Swiss in front of it that you get a different connotation.” The French-Swiss might argue about it, but it is inarguable that the new 117 chalets at the West Lakes Chalet Village on the company’s Minehead park are very different not only to those early versions but to the still-functioning ones in other parts of the resort. Butlin’s has spent £16m on the development, which is set in 6.9 hectares (17 acres) of landscaped gardens. Two-, three- and four-bedroom versions are available. Painted in pastel shades (like Butlin’s originals), they boast balconies and verandas and open plan living areas. The fairground and pavilion packed with all sorts of entertainments is a a short stroll away. The company also, cleverly, worked with the website Mumsnet to find out what mothers actually wanted from a chalet. After almost half said they did not want televisions in children’s bedrooms, Butlin’s left them out. Almost 60% said they were worried about bad weather wrecking family holidays – prompting the company to equip chalets with arts and crafts materials. They are also providing a library of board games designed to get families off tablets and smartphones and interacting with each other. The original Butlin’s chalets were conceived as an antithesis to the existing concept of a seaside holiday when people would arrive at the coast from towns and cities on charabancs and stay in guesthouses run by landladies whose inflexible rules meant guests were kicked out at breakfast time and not allowed back in except at meal or bedtimes. Butlin watched these holidaymakers trying to find shelter and entertainment in the rain and decided to offer them something that gave them more independence and dignity. The historian Kathryn Ferry, who specialises in the British seaside and holiday camps, said: “Billy Butlin had a talent for giving British holidaymakers what they wanted before they knew they wanted it. “The chalet was a key part of his vision because it gave people freedom. It seems obvious now but it was revolutionary in the 1930s and the things people expect on their holidays today really owe a lot to his vision all those years ago.” Butlin’s seems still to be on top of its game. It had 1.2 million stay at its resorts in Minehead, Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Skegness in Lincolnshire last year. Sales are up by 8% this year. Adrian Rogers, 48, from Dorset, was one of the first to sample the delights of the new chalets at Minehead. He was impressed. “I’ve been coming here since I was born and visit maybe five times a year,” he said. “But I’ve never seen anything like these chalets. They are great.” Butlin's regular Adrian Rogers on the company's swish new chalets. http://t.co/xzQjYjVjGD What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years' War.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.  After reading the above, is \\"By nuclear reacations\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does the liquid metal within the Earth's core generate a magnetic field?\\"?","output":"Imagine you're playing with a big ball filled with gooey liquid that has tiny, shiny, magnetic toys (like little metal marbles) floating in it. When you spin the ball, the liquid inside moves and swirls around. As the tiny, shiny toys move, they create a force, like an invisible net around the ball. This is similar to how the Earth's core works! Now, back to your question about \\"nuclear reactions.\\" That's a bit different, like when you put together tiny building blocks called atoms and create energy. That's not how the Earth's core creates a magnetic field. So, \\"By nuclear reactions\\" is not the correct answer for how the liquid metal within the Earth's core generates a magnetic field. The right answer is the movement of the liquid metal with the tiny magnetic bits (like iron and nickel) when the Earth spins."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which currency is represented by the ISO code EGP????","output":"The currency represented by the ISO code EGP is the Egyptian Pound. The ISO 4217 is an international standard specifying three-letter codes for different currencies. EGP stands for Egyptian Pound, where \\"E\\" refers to Egypt, and \\"GP\\" refers to Pound. This helps in identifying and distinguishing the currencies globally. The Egyptian Pound is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and it is managed by the Central Bank of Egypt. The Egyptian Pound has a long history, dating back to the early 19th century. During the time of British occupation in the early 1800s, the Egyptian Pound was linked to the British Pound Sterling. The Egyptian Pound was then pegged to gold and various currencies over the years, reflecting significant political, economic, and social changes. Currently, the Pound is a floating currency, meaning its value depends on market forces of supply and demand. The Egyptian Pound is further divided into 100 smaller units, known as \\"piastres\\" in English or \\"qirsh\\" in Arabic. However, because of inflation over the years, piastre coins are nowadays less frequently used in daily currency transactions. The Central Bank of Egypt issues the country's banknotes and coins in various denominations ranging from 1 to 200 Egyptian pounds for banknotes and 25 and 50 piastres, and 1 pound for coins. Egypt's economy has faced fluctuating trends in growth and inflation, which have impacted the value of its currency. Tourism, remittances from Egyptians working abroad, the Suez Canal, and agricultural exports are some of the critical sources of income for the Egyptian economy. Moreover, ongoing economic reforms, such as reducing energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax (VAT), have helped stabilize the Egyptian economy in recent years. In conclusion, the ISO code EGP represents the Egyptian Pound, which is the official currency of the Arab Republic of Egypt. It plays an essential role in Egypt's economy and holds historical significance. The Central Bank of Egypt manages the issuance of banknotes and coins, and the exchange rate of EGP against other currencies is determined by market forces, reflecting Egypt's economic performance."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In JuÃ¡rez, Adrian meets up with Diaz (Antonio Banderas), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper \\"El Sol de JuÃ¡rez\\". She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker. Later Diaz gets shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. Eva changes her mind and does not want to testify any more for fear of revenge, and tries to flee to the U.S., together with...

Liverpool are prepared to pay an increase on the £10million fee they have agreed with Lille to accelerate Divock Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Brendan Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in, they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. Belgium's Divock Origi, second left, scores the second goal against Iceland on Wednesday night. Origi (right) celebrates with team-mates after his goal against Iceland at the King Baudouin stadium. Lille, however, have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant he would stay the full season in France, and hand Origi to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old has admitted he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling. ‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club. If there was that chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it. Liverpool bought Origi from Lille  for £10million but loaned him back to the French side for the season. ‘I would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille. It’s fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But I can’t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better. I think there are good things waiting for me with Liverpool.’ Origi, who has scored five goals in France this season, played for Lille in both their Europa League matches against Everton recently. He has made a point of watching how Liverpool have fared and believes their current position in the Barclays Premier League does not reflect their capabilities. ‘I have been following Liverpool closely, the events of what has been going on and I think they have had a difficult time,’ said Origi. ‘They have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players. They also have a very, very good coach. ‘But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. It is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge, for instance. What I believe is that they just have to be more efficient but I also believe that it is only a matter of time before it comes.’ Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

That night, they played the shorter game because the time was limited. This decision was made to ensure that everyone could fully participate and enjoy the game without feeling rushed or pressured to finish quickly. Playing a shorter game allowed the family to spend quality time together without taking up the entire evening. The limited time constraint may have been due to various reasons, such as busy schedules, early morning commitments, or even a simple desire to engage in other activities that night. Shorter games can be just as enjoyable, and sometimes even more engaging, than their lengthier counterparts. By choosing a shorter game, the family was able to experience a variety of emotions, such as excitement, tension, and laughter within a condensed time frame. This enabled them to quickly switch between different games or activities during the evening and kept the atmosphere lively and dynamic. Additionally, playing a shorter game ensured that the interest and motivation of the players remained constant. Lengthy games can sometimes lead to players growing tired or losing interest over time, which can ultimately affect the overall enjoyment and cohesion of the group. In choosing the shorter game, the family was also able to accommodate the different attention spans and skill levels of its members. Some might have preferred games with a faster pace, while others might have needed a less overwhelming experience, especially in a limited timeframe. Moreover, playing a shorter game allowed the family to bond and create new memories in a short period. These memorable moments were an essential aspect of the family's time together that night, contributing to the building of relationships and the strengthening of their emotional connections. In conclusion, that night the family played the shorter game because the time was limited. This decision not only made the best use of the available time but also ensured that everyone maintained their interest, the atmosphere remained lively, and each member could fully enjoy the bonding experience.

Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part.

While they note a few positive aspects, like the acting by Micheal Keaton and Matt Dillon, these points seem somewhat overshadowed by their overall dissatisfaction with the movie.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

No, the sentence \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" is not grammatically correct because it lacks proper punctuation and phrasing. A more appropriate way to ask the question would be: \\"Is the phrase 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Question 2: \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Available options: (1). no; (2). yes; To answer question 2, we need to analyze the phrase \\"I've a\\" and discuss its grammatical correctness. \\"I've\\" is a contraction of \\"I have.\\" Contractions are formed by combining two words into one, where an apostrophe replaces the omitted letter(s). In this case, the letter 'h' and the space between the two words are replaced by an apostrophe. When the contraction \\"I've\\" (I have) is followed by a verb in the -ing form (e.g., \\"I've been running\\" or \\"I've finished\\"), it is grammatically correct. However, using \\"I've\\" before a noun (\\"I've a book\\" or \\"I've a car\\") may not sound standard, especially in American English. In British English, though, the construction \\"I've a\\" can sometimes be idiomatic and informal, especially in spoken English.

As for the final question, \\"Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?\\", the answer is no.

Usage: A polynomial equation can be represented using a list of its weights. Example: equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4. In this case, the list [6, 4] shows that the weights of x are 6 and 4, respectively, in a 1-degree polynomial equation. Part #3: Substituting a given value of x in the polynomial equation.

Explanation: This answer is more consistent with the story being described. The location is a beach and the girls have just woken up, therefore it makes sense that they would head directly to the sand to begin playing. As for the other options: (1). take turns swimming in the long ocean. Swimming in the ocean is a plausible scenario but since they just woke up, it is more likely they would start by playing in the sand, especially considering they are little. Swimming usually requires supervision and preparation, which is not mentioned in the context. (2). hold hands and stand facing each other. There's no context to suggest they would engage in such an activity. This answer does not follow the scope of the girls' actions especially being at the beach. (4). walk into the beach.

In fact, many people never read a poem once they get out of high school. It is worth reminding ourselves that this has not always been the case in prefix = st1 /America. In the nine-tenth century, a usual American activity was to sit around the fireside in the evening and read poems aloud. It is true that there was no television at the time, nor movie theaters, nor World Wide Web, to provide _ However, poems were a source of pleasure, of self - education, of connection to other people or to the world beyond one ' s own  community. Reading them was a social act as well as an individual one, and perhaps even more social than individual. Writing poems to share with friends and relations was, like reading poems by the fireside, another way in which poetry has a place in everyday life. How did things change? Why are most Americans no longer comfortable with poetry , and why do most people today think that a poem has nothing to tell them and that they can do well without poems? There are, I believe, three factors: poets, teachers, and we ourselves. Of these, the least important is the third: the world surrounding the poem has betrayed   us more than we have betrayed the poem. Early in the twentieth century, poetry in English headed into directions unfavor-able to reading of poetry. Readers decided that poems were not for the fireside or the easy chair at night, and that they belonged where other difficult-to-read things belonged. Poets failed the reader, so did teachers. They want their students to know something about the skills of a poem, they want their students to see that poems mean something. Yet what usually occurs when teachers push these concerns on their high school students is that young people decide poems are unpleasant crossword puzzles. Answer:","output":"Which of the following best describes the historical shift in the perception of poetry in everyday life in America? A. Poetry was once a popular pastime, enjoyed and shared among friends and family, but changed as modern forms of entertainment and education emerged. B.

Ask a question about Political philosophy.","output":"Question: What is the role of social contract theory in contemporary political philosophy, and how did key philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contribute to the development of this theory? Answer: Social contract theory is a significant and influential aspect of contemporary political philosophy. It posits that the relationship between the governed and their government is based on an implicit or explicit agreement, referred to as the \\"social contract.\\" According to this political ideology, individuals agree to relinquish some personal autonomy and adhere to certain rules or norms to maintain a functioning society. The enforcement of these rules is then entrusted to a governing authority or political institutions. Social contract theory has significantly shaped Western political thought and has played a vital role in the development of modern liberal democracies. Three key philosophers – Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau – significantly contributed to the development and advancement of social contract theory. 1. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679): Hobbes' most famous work, \\"Leviathan,\\" was an early and influential example of social contract theory, published in 1651. His thoughts on the matter came in the wake of the English Civil War, which convinced him of the necessity of strong government to prevent societal discord. Hobbes argued that in a pre-governmental state, known as the \\"state of nature,\\" human life was \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" In this anarchic state, people lived in constant fear and pursued self-preservation above all else. To remedy this situation, Hobbes claimed that individuals would willingly enter into a social contract, surrendering their individual rights and liberties to a sovereign authority. This absolute ruler, which Hobbes referred to as the Leviathan, would provide law and order, enforce social rules, and protect subjects from external threats. In return, subjects would obey the ruler and the system of laws set in place. For Hobbes, a strong and unified government, even if oppressive, was better than the chaos that reigned in the state of nature. 2. John Locke (1632-1704): Locke, often referred to as the father of liberalism, introduced a more optimistic view of human nature and the social contract in his \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" published in 1689. Contrary to Hobbes, Locke believed that humans lived in relative peace and cooperation in the state of nature, possessing natural rights to life, liberty, and property. For Locke, the primary purpose of government was to protect these rights. Individuals would form a social contract by instituting a government and agreeing to follow its laws. However, rather than an omnipotent sovereign, power was to be entrusted to a parliamentary system with a clear separation of powers, ensuring that no single entity had absolute control. Importantly, Locke advocated for the right to revolution if a government failed to protect the people's rights or became tyrannical. 3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Rousseau introduced a more egalitarian perspective to the social contract theory in his influential 1762 work, \\"The Social Contract.\\" For Rousseau, individuals in the state of nature were equal and autonomous. He famously claimed that \\"man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\\" Therefore, humanity entered into a social contract not only to secure their rights and protection but also to overcome the constraints and inequalities imposed by society. Rousseau's vision of the social contract differed from his predecessors by emphasizing the collective or \\"general will\\" as the guiding principle of political legitimacy. He argued that laws should be established through direct democracy, giving each citizen an equal voice in legislation. To ensure that the general will prevailed, Rousseau envisioned a decentralized form of government, with power dispersed among smaller communities. While not entirely against a central government, Rousseau maintained that authority should be limited, serving only to coordinate the decisions made by local communities. In conclusion, social contract theory has played a crucial role in shaping contemporary political philosophy. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, with their respective approaches and contributions, helped lay the foundation for today's modern liberal democracies by articulating the rationale behind the existence of government, its legitimacy, and the importance of individual rights and collective will for a more just society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process:  - The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the winter comes earlier this year happens, how will it affect more bile occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Although the perturbation of winter coming earlier than usual does not have a direct impact on the liver's ability to produce bile, it can have indirect effects on the human body, thereby influencing the liver's functioning and bile production. Let's explore this in more detail by examining the relationship between the liver's functions, seasonal changes and the possible effects. 1. General effects of winter on the body: Winter brings lower temperatures, less sunshine, and shorter days. These conditions can cause a reduction in physical activity and changes in mood, leading to increased stress levels. Stress, in turn, affects various bodily systems, and the liver is no exception. High stress can cause the liver to work harder, leading to an overproduction of bile or other processes being strained. 2. Effects on digestion and nutrition: Winter weather can impact our food choices and digestive patterns. People may consume more high-calorie and high-fat foods during the colder months, and the lack of sunlight can affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D, which is essential for numerous bodily functions. An increase in the consumption of high-fat foods puts additional pressure on the liver, as it has to produce more bile for digestion. With more bile being produced, the risk of bile-related issues like gallstones may increase. 3. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): The onset of winter can trigger a type of depression called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is linked to a drop in serotonin levels due to reduced exposure to sunlight. People suffering from SAD may experience changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and mood. These changes can lead to an increased consumption of comfort foods, which are often high in fat, again requiring the liver to produce more bile and possibly increasing the risk of bile-related issues. 4. Winter infections and illnesses: Winter is a prime time for infections and illnesses such as colds and flu. The immune system will be working overtime to protect the body, which could lead to inflammation and impact the normal functioning of organs, including the liver. If the liver is already working harder to produce more bile due to dietary changes, any additional inflammation or infection during winter can strain its functions further. 5. Adaptive response to cold temperatures: The human body, in an attempt to maintain a stable internal environment, might adapt to cold temperatures by increasing metabolic activity. In turn, this can increase the liver's workload, which may lead to an altered bile production rate. In conclusion, although the perturbation of winter arriving earlier than expected does not have a direct effect on the liver and bile production, various indirect effects may occur due to changes in the body's response to winter conditions. These indirect effects can impact the liver's ability to produce bile and may potentially lead to issues related to bile production and digestion. This relationship underlines the importance of paying close attention to one's diet, physical activity, and overall health during winter months to maintain optimal liver function and general well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Image copyright Texas Lawyer Image caption Judge George Gallagher      A Texas appeals court has overturned a man's conviction after finding a judge had inappropriately electrified him in court, US media report.      Terry Lee Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual performance from a child and was sentenced to 60 years.      Judge George Gallagher ordered the bailiff to activate a stun belt sending 50,000 volts through Morris when he allegedly refused to answer questions.      The higher court found that stun belts cannot be used as punishment in court.      Mr Morris appealed his 2014 conviction alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when the judge used the belt as punishment for not answering questions properly.      The belts - used by courtrooms such as the one Tarrant County in Texas - are affixed around the legs or midsection of a suspect in court and are used to deliver a shock to the person should they become violent.      Mr Morris said he was too scared to return to court out of more electrical shocks, the Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso heard.      The appeals court ruled on 28 February that Mr Morris' shocks and removal from the court was a violation of his constitutional right to be present and confront witnesses during his trial. The decision was first reported by the Texas Lawyer news website on Tuesday.      He has now been ordered to stand for a new trial.      During the case in which Mr Morris was convicted of soliciting sexual acts from a 15-year-old girl, Judge Gallagher asked him to enter his plea of \\"guilty or not guilty\\".      When Mr Morris responded by saying he had a lawsuit against Judge Gallagher and his defence lawyer, the judge warned him that he would shock him if he did not \\"follow the rules\\", the Washington Post newspaper reported, citing court transcripts.      Mr Morris asked the judge to recuse himself because of the lawsuit when the judge directed the bailiff to shock him.      The judge ordered the defendant to be shocked two more times as Mr Morris told the court he had a history of mental illness and complained that he was being \\"tortured\\".      Mr Morris's attorney, Bill Ray, told the Texas Lawyer that he did not object to the use of the stun belt because his client was acting \\"like a loaded cannon ready to go off\\", and that he did not really believe that he was being shocked.      The appeals court said the order clarifies that no Texas judges are allowed to shock defendants for refusing to follow the court's rules of decorum.      \\"Never before have we seen any behaviour like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behaviour again,\\" wrote appeals court Justice Yvonne Rodriguez.      \\"We must speak out against it, lest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\\"      More on stun weapons ||||| State District Judge George Gallagher of Tarrant County told a bailiff on three occasions to punish an uncooperative defendant with electric shocks, and now the sex offender's conviction has been overturned and a new trial ordered.      Stun belts can be strapped around the legs of some defendants and used to deliver thousands of volts of electric shock in the instance a defendant turns violent or attempts to escape the courtroom. However, in the case of Terry Lee Morris, who was convicted in 2014 of charges of soliciting sexual performance from a 15-year-old girl, an appeals court found that Gallagher used electric shocks as punishment after Morris failed to answer the judge's questions properly.                  Gallagher, the District 396 judge since 2000, declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman with the Tarrant County district attorney's office.                  After enduring the 50,000-volt shocks, Morris was apparently too scared to return to the courtroom and actually did not attend the remainder of his own trial. He appealed his conviction, alleging Gallagher violated his constitutional rights by repeatedly shocking him for failing to answer questions while showing no signs of becoming violent or being a flight risk.                  CYBER MONDAY SALE! Only 20 for a full year of digital access! Hurry! Offer ends Monday! SUBSCRIBE NOW      The Texas Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso handed down its ruling on Feb. 28. Texas Lawyer first reported the ruling Tuesday. The ruling said judges are not permitted to shock defendants who won't answer questions or don't follow the court's rules of decorum.      “While the trial court’s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge’s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum,” Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez said of Gallagher’s actions in the court’s opinion.      “A stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge’s whim. This Court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes,\\" Rodriguez wrote.      Morris, 54, remains in the Wynne Unit in Huntsville. Besides the conviction that was overturned, he was convicted in 1992 of causing bodily injury to a child and sentenced to 12 years to prison.      His attorney at the 2014 trial, Billy Ray, told the Star-Telegram that he was \\"scared to death of what Morris might do. I was scared of the way he was acting.      \\"But I felt kind of sorry for Morris,\\" Ray said. \\"I was trying to defuse Morris instead of telling the judge what to do. I felt that if I could have gotten Morris calmed down we could get through this thing.\\"      Morris had filed a lawsuit against Ray and wanted him to recuse himself as his attorney.      \\"Morris appeared to hate me but I think really he hated the situation more,\\" Ray said. \\"But you can't leave a defendant just because you believe he hates you; that's not the way it works. I was his second or third lawyer.\\" SHARE COPY LINK In this body camera footage, a group of correctional officers at the Muscogee County Jail in Muscogee, Ga. are seen handcuffing inmate Cortney Jackson after using a Taser and physical force to bring him to the ground. Jackson was staying in a dorm 'Hit him again'      Gallagher ordered a bailiff to administer the electric shocks on the first day of his trial. When Gallagher asked Morris for his plea, guilty or not guilty. Morris refused to answer the question.      “Sir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,” Morris responded, according to the appeals court.      Morris told the judge he had a pending lawsuit against his defense attorney.      Gallagher became irritated and warned Morris about further \\"outbursts.\\"      \\"Mr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,” Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. “You will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen: No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.”      Morris answered, \\"All right, sir.\\"      When Morris continued to talk, Gallagher instructed the bailiff to activate the stun belts around Morris' legs.      Gallagher asked Morris twice more if he was going to follow the rules. When Morris did not provide a plea, Gallagher said to the bailiff, \\"Hit him,\\" according to the appeals court ruling.      The bailiff pressed the button that was to send the electric shock through Morris' body. Gallagher asked him again if he was going to comply. Morris told him he had a history of mental illness. Gallagher ordered another shock.      \\"Hit him again,\\" Gallagher said.      When Morris contended he was being \\"tortured\\" for seeking a recusal, Gallagher, according to the appeals court, ordered the bailiff to do it again: \\"Would you hit him again?\\"      The appeals court said that 50,000 volts can have cognitive impairment effects on a defendant.

I know it says he was getting electrocuted, but they didn’t shock him.”      Ray said Morris was behaving like a “loaded cannon ready to go off.\\" He told the Star-Telegram that he said he was afraid that Morris \\"would do something that might have gotten him hurt a lot worse.      \\"And Judge Gallagher is not the kind of person who is mean to people,\\" Ray said.      However, El Paso's Eighth Court of Appeals ruled that Gallagher shocked Morris as punishment and not for security reasons.      “Never before have we seen behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,” Rodriguez wrote. “As the circumstances of this case perfectly illustrate, the potential for abuse in the absence of an explicit prohibition on non-security use of stun belts exists and must be deterred.”      Gallagher later stated for the record that he was concerned by Morris' agitation and movements, suggesting he was within reach of a 200-pound wall-mounted courtroom video monitor that he could have pulled off and used to injure attorneys in the courtroom.      \\"It was based on the totality of his continuing escalation and his movements that the court ordered the shock belt be initiated,\\" Gallagher said at the time, according to Texas Lawyer. \\"It was done for the safety of the lawyers and all of the participants.\\"      SHARE COPY LINK Dash cam footage released by the Irving Police Department shows Kenneth Roblez, 38, attempt to avoid being pulled over by an officer.

Stun belts are meant to be used to control violent defendants, but Morris's conduct did not rise to that level, the court found."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Where is tin stored forever? - shopping bag - hardware store - landfill - junk yard - antique store  The best answer is Answer:","output":"Tin, a chemical element with the symbol Sn, is a versatile and useful material commonly used for various purposes, such as in the production of cans, electronic components, and as a component in alloys like bronze and pewter. The question of where tin is stored forever is a complex one, as it depends on factors such as its form, use and disposal, and societal practices. The options provided - shopping bag, hardware store, landfill, junk yard, and antique store - represent different contexts in which tin might be found or stored. Let's explore each of these options in detail to determine the best answer. 1. Shopping bag: A shopping bag is a temporary storage option that will likely not store tin \\"forever.\\" Tin products may be contained in a shopping bag during transportation from a retail outlet to a consumer's home or workplace. However, once the consumer puts the tin item to use, the bag no longer serves as a storage place for tin, rendering this option not suitable. 2. Hardware store: A hardware store is another temporary storage location for tin. Hardware stores stock various tin products, such as tin sheets, foils, and tin-based solders. While these stores store tin for a certain period until it is purchased and used by consumers, they cannot be considered as a \\"forever\\" storage option. 3. Landfill: Landfills are the final destination for many waste materials, including tin. When tin products reach the end of their useful life and are discarded as waste, they may end up in landfills. Over time, tin exposed to air and moisture can corrode and disintegrate, releasing tin ions into the environment that can eventually become part of the soil. This natural process makes landfill a feasible option for tin to be stored \\"forever,\\" although it is not an ideal solution due to potential environmental consequences. 4. Junk yard: Similar to landfills, junk yards serve as a final resting place for innumerable discarded objects made of various materials, including tin. Although tin products may be found in junk yards as waste, the permanence of their storage there is uncertain. Junk yards often sort and process materials for recycling or disposal, which may include tin. So, while tin can be stored in junk yards for extended periods, it is not a \\"forever\\" storage solution. 5. Antique store: Antique stores can preserve and store tin items in the form of vintage or historical artifacts, such as tin toys, cans, and decorative objects. Although these tin items are stored and preserved for a long time, the concept of \\"forever\\" might not apply, as these objects may eventually be sold, exchanged, or passed on to other collectors. In summary, out of the provided options, the landfill seems to be the most plausible answer for where tin might potentially be stored \\"forever.\\" However, it is important to note that none of these options represent an ideal or permanent storage solution for tin, highlighting the necessity to develop sustainable practices for tin use, recycling, and disposal. Integrating recycling processes into waste management systems can help reduce the amount of tin being sent to landfills, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Wisconsin Democrats won President Obama’s attention and inspired other states by bolting the capital to protest a crackdown on unions. David Graham on the history of the political walkout.      You can’t win a vote when you’ve got fewer votes than your opponents. But Wisconsin Democrats are discovering a centuries-old corollary truth this week: you can’t lose a vote if you don’t let it happen. And that’s why 14 of them have fled out of Madison and across the border into Illinois, hoping to prevent a vote that would cut benefits for public-sector workers and curtail the right to collective bargaining.      As hundreds of protestors demonstrated against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's budget proposal, the Senate chamber in Madison remained quiet on February 17. (Photo: Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / MCT / Landov)      It’s really just another tool in the minority toolbox—a sibling to the stalling tactic of proposing amendments and a cousin to that peculiar U.S. Senate obstructionist tradition, the filibuster. It carries distinct risks, since legislators who try it are literally running away from their jobs. But it can also be an effective way to buy time, since state police can’t drag legislators over state lines where they don’t have jurisdiction. And the example being set in Wisconsin could well stir copycats across the country, as budget battles grow ever more heated. In Ohio and Indiana, similar benefit battles loom, and both sides are watching their counterparts in Wisconsin to figure out what tactics work.      “It’s odd that it doesn’t happen more often,” says Sarah Binder, a senior fellow and Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution. The situation in Wisconsin may be atypical—“This may be somewhat unusual, getting the president of the United States to weigh in on a legislative matter,” she says—and it might not gain additional votes. But it is a way for Democrats to influence the public mood and perhaps persuade Gov. Scott Walker and state Senate Republicans to tone down the bill. “Expanding the scope of conflict makes it much harder for Republicans to keep control of the story,” Binder says.      While the temptation to follow Wisconsin’s lead may be growing, the list of notable uses of quorum-breaking in American history is still rather short. A look at some of the highlights:      1. Thomas Burke’s Departure      As long as Americans have had legislatures, they’ve had disagreements and desperate minorities. In 1778, the Continental Congress was considering a critical letter to Gen. George Washington. Thomas Burke, a delegate from North Carolina, opposed the missive and stalked out of the congress, garnering him much abuse from his frustrated—but ultimately powerless—colleagues. North Carolinians, however, rallied around Burke because he justified his move by declaring that his allegiance was to his state and would not be weakened by unreasonable moves of a tyrannical central government.      A dozen legislators hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them.      2. Abraham Lincoln’s Acrobatics      Before Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and a staid statesman, he was a Whig and a rabble-rouser. Fighting a Democratic bill in Springfield to make payments only in gold or silver rather than paper money, Lincoln led Whigs to walk out and head off a quorum, as Karl Kurtz of the National Council of State Legislatures recalls. It worked one day, but the following day, Democrats were able to get back on track when Lincoln and a colleague entered the chamber to make the required motion for a quorum call. By the time the Whigs realized the trick, they were locked in. An attempt to dive out the window succeeded only in making them laughingstocks, and the bill passed.      3. “The Disappearing Quorum”      Late in the 1800s, the U.S. House had become a hotbed of obstruction, much to the chagrin of Speaker Thomas Reed, an Ohio Republican, who set out to reform the rules. One favorite tactic was for representatives to come to the chamber but refuse to answer a roll call. Finally, in 1890, a furious Reed announced that if the clerk could see a member—rather than just hear his response—he would be counted toward a quorum. “Members started diving under their desks and running for the cloakrooms and stuff” to avoid being counted, says Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Despite heated objections, Reed’s reform stuck, and the House minority lost a valuable tool.      4. Texas’ Killer Bees      Texas requires a two-thirds majority for a quorum, making mischief an especially attractive prospect there. In 1979, 12 liberal Democrats had already been nicknamed the “Killer Bees” for frequently blocking legislation. Their greatest moment came when they decided to flee to stop a bill to change the date of the state’s primary. The dozen hid out in a tiny apartment, using coded telephone signals as Texas Rangers fanned across the state to find them. Although one senator left and was captured, the others held out long enough to force the lieutenant governor to drop the proposal.      5. Bob Packwood vs. the Sergeant at Arms      In the midst of a filibuster showdown in 1988, Republicans irked Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd by refusing to come to the floor. But Byrd, the legendary master of parliamentary tactics, was the wrong man to cross: he dug out an obscure rule that allowed him to call all members to the chamber at 12:30 a.m. under penalty of arrest by the Sergeant at Arms. Some members literally ran away; another, Oregon’s Bob Packwood, injured his arm while trying to barricade himself in his office. Packwood was eventually convinced to come to the Senate, but he insisted that they carry him across the threshold.      6. The Texas Eleven      During a fight over redistricting, Democratic members of the state house and senate learned the lessons of the Killer Bees—and fled the Lone Star State altogether. A Republican plan, which Democrats derided as gerrymandering, would have eliminated five Democratic seats in Congress. It started in May 2003, when 51 House Democrats skipped town and went to Oklahoma, killing the plan. Republicans tried again later in the session, and 11 Democratic senators headed to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Speaking with Newsweek on Friday, Senator Mario Gallegos recalled a James Bond-like scenario. Senators had a plan in the event they had to flee, and kept bags packed in their offices. After a signal from their leader, all 11 met at a rendezvous point, where they were hustled into Chevy Suburbans and taken to the Austin airport to board two private planes—still unaware where they were going. Once in the air, they learned they were headed to Albuquerque, despite an order from the ground to return to Austin. “Obviously we told the pilots not to,” Gallegos says. “I said, ‘Oh hell, are we going to have two fighter jets force us to go back to Austin?’” The “Texas Eleven” held out for 46 days until Sen. John Whitmire decided he’d had enough and returned to Austin, making a quorum possible. What lessons can the runaways offer their counterparts in Wisconsin on their third day away? Gallegos says he doesn’t regret his 2003 run even though it ultimately failed, and he offered some moral support to the Wisconsin delegation. “If they feel strong about their position, they need to stay right where they’re at,” he says. “If they feel they’re representing our district, they need to stay right where they’re at.” But Gallegos’ colleague Juan Hinojosa, another member of the Texas Eleven, spoke of a wearying ordeal and was a bit warier. “You’ve got to compromise while you’re out of state,” he says. “Keep the lines of communication open.”      David Graham is a reporter for Newsweek covering politics, national affairs, and business.

Walker and the GOP take language out of the budget repair bill that dilutes union rights.      Which do you think is more likely to happen first?      Madison — As protests at the state Capitol entered their second week, Republicans and Democrats on Sunday were holding possible bargaining chips in their efforts to end the political standoff that has held up action on Gov. Scott Walker's budget repair bill.      If Democrats in the state Senate stay out of Wisconsin until Friday, they could undermine a key provision of Walker's plan to fix the state budget and take away most of public workers' union rights.      Without this refinancing element, the state would have to take other steps such as cuts to health care programs to keep its budget balanced this year. Walker and other leading Republicans are holding firm despite the deadline.      Meanwhile, Republicans who control the state Senate sought Sunday to put pressure on the Democrats in Illinois with their own leverage point: by planning action on a \\"full calendar\\" of undisclosed bills for Tuesday, said Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau).      Without Democrats present, the Republicans have enough members to be able to hold votes on nonfinancial bills, such as confirmation of Walker cabinet appointments, but not on a budget bill.      \\"The work of the Senate is not going to be held hostage just because the minority refuses to show up and do their jobs,\\" Welhouse said.      Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona) declined Sunday to say how long Democrats would stay in Illinois, where they have been holed up since Thursday to prevent the Senate from having enough lawmakers on the floor to vote on Walker's bill. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said he believed he and other senators were willing to stay away until Friday or even longer if necessary.      \\"A true leader wouldn't force people into this situation, and the governor needs to learn his lesson,\\" Miller said.      With snow and cold rain falling on Madison Sunday, the crowd of demonstrators at the Capitol shrank from the massive levels of last week. But union supporters still turned out a sizable demonstration by normal statehouse standards, filling the rotunda with their numbers and chants.      After districts in Madison and Milwaukee canceled classes last week because of teachers not showing up for work, Mary Bell, the president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Sunday that teachers should report back to their schools. If teachers are off Monday, which is Presidents Day, Bell said they should come to Madison to keep up the demonstrations against Walker's bill.      \\"It's time for educators to be back in the classroom with the students,\\" Bell told reporters in a teleconference.      Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison's public schools will be closed on Monday, but officials at both districts said they expected to reopen on Tuesday.      Miller said Democrats would quickly return if the governor and Republicans who control the Legislature would agree to take out the provisions on union rights. He said Republicans should agree to that because Democrats and public worker unions are willing to accept economic concessions in the bill that amount to roughly an 8% pay cut for an average state employee with family health coverage.      But Walker stuck with his proposal Sunday. The governor said that the budget repair bill's cuts to public worker benefits and its repeal of union rights were both necessary to avoid the layoffs of 10,000 to 12,000 state and local employees.      \\"This is about balancing not only our next budget but the budgets two, four, six years into the future,\\" Walker told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\"      Walker said he believed Wisconsin was helping lead the nation in efforts - also under way in other states - to change the way state and local governments deal with their unions.      \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes,\\" he said.      Besides the union bargaining provisions, the bill includes many other elements, including a refinancing of state debt that Walker wants to shore up the state's finances through the fiscal year that ends June 30. That would push back 165 million in principal payments on the bonds into future years and free up money that could be used to help the state pay two large outstanding bills - one owed to the state of Minnesota and another owed to a fund for medical malpractice victims.      The Legislature's nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said Walker's bill, as amended by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee last week, would leave the state with just 65 million in reserves. So without the money from the refinancing, the state would have a further projected shortfall of roughly 100 million to make up.      To allow time for that refinancing deal to go through, the bill must pass by Friday, according to a memo earlier this month by state Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. More recently, Huebsch said it may be possible to pull off the bond deal if the bill passes by Saturday, but no later than that.      \\"If we can't pass this by then, we lose our window for refinancing in this (fiscal year),\\" he said.      If a deal can't be done, employee layoffs and cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, elderly and disabled, may be necessary, he said.      GOP lawmakers are standing firmly with Walker. Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester), co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, noted Republicans did not leave Wisconsin in 2009 when Democrats controlled the Legislature and governor's office and passed a series of bills that were anathema to Republicans.      \\"If this is a new standard where you can say, 'We can extort the majority,' then they have set up a permanent state of chaos in this state,\\" Vos said.      On Sunday at the Capitol, union supporters clapped and chanted, \\"Kill the bill with kindness.\\" No incidents or arrests were reported, said Lt. Mary Ricksecker of the Madison police.      The bill would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs - typically 5.8% of pay for state workers - and in many cases at least 12% of their health care costs. Union leaders have said they are willing to accept those concessions, which total nearly 330 million through June 2013.      Under the bill, the unions could not bargain over anything but wages, would have to hold annual elections to keep their organizations intact and would lose the ability to have union dues deducted from state paychecks. Employees would no longer have to automatically pay union dues, but could choose whether they want to do so.      It is those union changes that Democrats and public workers are demanding to be stripped from the bill. The changes affect most local, school and state employees, but police, firefighters and state troopers are exempt.      Republicans control the Senate 19-14, but 20 senators must be present to pass bills with budget ramifications. That gives Democrats the ability to stop action, provided they all stick together.      Senators are using personal funds, not state funds, to pay their expenses while they're in Illinois, Miller and Erpenbach said. They said senators were taking their salaries because they believed they were doing their jobs by standing up for workers' rights.      The departure of the Senate Democrats recalls the 2003 stand-off in Texas in which Democratic senators went to New Mexico to block the adoption of a new map of legislative districts. That incident lasted a month, and ended when one of the 11 senators defected from the group.      ***      What happens next      Monday: A hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. in Dane County Circuit Court on a request by the Madison Metropolitan School District to force teachers to return to school.

Don Walker of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| The Democratic Wisconsin state senators camped out across the border in Illinois fired back at Gov. Scott Walker today, saying their action to block a vote on his budget proposal is an effort to protect democracy.      Walker, whose budget bill sparked six straight days of protests at the capitol in Madison, today criticized the 14 Democrats, whose absence has prevented the state Senate from achieving the quorum necessary for a vote on the proposal.      \\"If you want to participate in democracy, you've got to be in the arena, and the arena is right here in Madison, Wisconsin,\\" Walker said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\"      \\"Democracy is not about hiding out in another state,\\" he said. \\"It's about showing up here in the capital and making the case there.\\"      State Sen. Julie Lassa, who is six months pregnant, said the governor is wrong about her and the others holed up in an Illinois hotel.      \\"For all of us who left the state, we believe we're standing up for democracy,\\" Nissa told ABC News' Barbara Pinto.      Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting Walker's proposal, which would cut benefits for public employees and drastically reduce unions' collective bargaining powers, have paralyzed the state capitol and the protesters said they aren't going anywhere.      \\"I know that the people here are not going home people are going to be here until he is gone,\\" protester Miles Kristan said.      Walker, though, was just as firm today in his resolve.      \\"We're willing to take this as long as it takes, because, in the end, we're doing the right thing,\\" he said. \\"We're doing the right thing for Wisconsin.\\"      He said the Democratic state senators who fled the state have \\"failed to do their jobs,\\" and he expects them to concede this week.      \\"My hope is that cooler minds will prevail and by some time earlier this coming week they'll show up for their job,\\" Walker said.      Instead, some 70,000 demonstrators showed up at the Capitol Saturday and a similar number today. Though most of them opposed Walker's budget proposal, which critics say is an effort at union busting, there were many backers of the bill as well this weekend.      In addition to the demonstration in Madison, a smaller pro-union rally also was held today in Green Bay, outside Packers Stadium.      Some tea party groups said Saturday they are forming exploratory committees to recall two of the Democrats who fled the state Thursday to protest the vote on the bill.      The tea party group Northwood Patriots said it would meet today to discuss the recall of state Senator Jim Holperin, while a separate group in Kenosha, called the Robert Wirch Exploratory Committee said it is looking into recalling state Senator Robert Wirch.      According to Madison's The Capital Times, a recall effort would require the exploratory committees to collect 15,000 to 20,000 petition signatures.      Walker told reporters Friday that he would not \\"allow protesters to drown out the voice of the taxpayers,\\" adding that he had received 19,000 supportive e-mails this week and that a \\"quiet majority\\" of the state's residents are behind his plan.      Walker, who unveiled the budget bill last Saturday, has been calling upon the Democrats to return and end their \\"theatrics.\\"      \\"The bottom line is we're broke,\\" the governor said. \\"We can't negotiate for something we don't have the ability to give on.\\"      Walker, faced with a 3.6 billion deficit, denied he is trying to bust the unions.      Wisconsin has a 137 million shortfall this year and 3.6 billion over the next two years.      Other governors facing similar budget crises are watching Wisconsin carefully. More than 40 states are facing a combined projected shortfall of 125 billion for the fiscal year of 2012. The hardest hit are California, facing a 25.5 billion gap, Texas at 13 billion, Illinois at 15 billion, New York at 9 billion and New Jersey at 10.5 billion.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How many nautical miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources?  \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources.

First, let's move the 'f' terms to one side: To do this, we need to subtract 35*f from both sides of the equation. So, we now have: -10 = 2*f + 6 (because 37*f - 35*f = 2*f) Now, let's move all the numbers to the other side to find the value for 'f': To do this, we need to subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. Now we have: -16 = 2*f (because -10 - 6 = -16) Finally, let's find the value of 'f': To do this, we will divide both sides by 2: So, f = -8 (because -16 divided by 2 is -8) That's the solution! f = -8.

Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".

But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Here is an article: David Moyes has dismissed suggestions that Robin van Persie is unhappy at Manchester United and says the striker has a good chance of returning for Saturday's game against Stoke. Van Persie was rested for the midweek Champions League victory over Real Sociedad and it was claimed in the Netherlands that supposed injuries to toes and groin were a cover for dissatisfaction in training. \\"That's complete nonsense,\\" the Manchester United manager said. \\"He has been playing with injections in his toes, he played one game for Holland with injections and we wanted to get away from that and give him a proper rest. I told him before the Southampton game that if he played he could miss the midweek game to get a little bit of recovery time. One of his small toes has been bothering him for a while and then he got the other one stood on at Shakhtar Donetsk and he felt it was affecting his groin as well.\\" By his standards, Van Persie has made a relatively quiet start to the season, or at least it feels that way, but he has scored four goals in seven Premier League games. \\"He's playing well, he's doing some great stuff for us and I've found him fantastic to work with,\\" Moyes said. \\"I'm surprised I am even having to answer this because he's been that good.\\" One thing Moyes will accept is that his team are not scoring enough goals. An inability to extend their lead beyond a single goal ended up costing them points when Southampton produced a late equaliser in the last league match and the story could have been the same against Sociedad when United were indebted to an own goal for the margin of victory, despite creating a hatful of chances. \\"At least we are creating chances, you can't say we are not going for it,\\" Moyes said. \\"It is a concern because we should have been out of sight against Sociedad. We've been hitting the post and bar and I've no doubt that somewhere along the line it will go for us and the goals will go in but at the same time we do need to be more clinical. You can do as much finishing practice as you want, recreate situations on the training ground and so on but the important thing is to do the job on Saturday afternoon. I would have taken the win in Europe no matter what because the points were important but we could have made our lives much easier with a couple more goals.\\" With only one taken from the last couple of home games, Premier League points are becoming a matter of concern as well, although Moyes takes the long view. \\"Only two months of the season have gone, I think there will be other teams slipping up before the end,\\" he said. \\"We just have to make sure we don't slip up as often.\\" Write a title for it.","output":"\\"David Moyes Dismisses Rumors of Van Persie's Unhappiness, Striker Likely to Return Against Stoke\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What name does the Major call the actor by? is inside the article: A few months before the D-Day landings during the Second World War, the British government decides to launch a campaign of disinformation; spreading a rumour that the landings just might take place at a location other than Normandy. The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson, is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information. This happens quickly and their aeroplane is (unsuccessfully) attacked on leaving Gibraltar., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The Major calls the actor \\"Jimmy\\" in this story. The actor he refers to is M. E. Clifton James, a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps, who was also a professional actor in peacetime. Major Harvey comes across James while watching a theatre performance in London, where James convincingly impersonates General Bernard Montgomery.

The primary objective of the European Central Bank, as laid down in Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. The Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”. (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) Unlike for example the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ad-hoc. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where is the primary mission of the European Central Bank listed?","output":"The primary mission of the European Central Bank (ECB) is listed in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, it can be found in Article 127(1) of the treaty. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is one of two primary Treaties that form the constitutional basis of the European Union, the other being the Treaty on European Union. The TFEU outlines the roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures of the various institutions and decision-making bodies within the EU. It includes a wide variety of topics, ranging from agriculture and fisheries to transport and health. Returning to the subject of the European Central Bank, its primary mission, as stated in Article 127(1) of the TFEU, is maintaining price stability within the Eurozone. This means that the ECB aims to control inflation and prevent significant price fluctuations that could negatively impact the economy.  In October 1998, the Governing Council further defined this objective of price stability, stating that they view it as keeping the inflation rate of the Euro area below but close to 2%, measured by the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is an indicator of inflation and price stability in the Eurozone. It is a consumer price index that has been standardized across all member countries of the European Union in order to provide a comparable measure of inflation. Therefore, the ECB's primary mission is not simply declared in their statutes or laws, but is reflected in their continual efforts to maintain a stable price level in the Eurozone over the medium term by managing inflation rates. This price stability contributes to a stable economic environment, which is essential for sustainable economic growth and welfare in the Euro area. Unlike other central banks, such as the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective, focusing solely on price stability, with no formal statutory definition or quantified target beyond the ad-hoc HICP target."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you go to school together, walk up to her in the halls and say hello after you've talked in class a couple times. You will make a good impression if you do nice things, like holding a door for her to go through or tying her shoe if you notice it has come undone. Do not go out of your way to do these things all the time. She will think it is weird instead of sweet. Many guys prefer to cut to the chase, but if she is worth asking out, it is worth building a friendship. If you ask her out without getting to know her first, she might turn you down just because she doesn't know enough about you to say yes. Text or chat with her for long periods of time. Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes. Make sure she asks you too, otherwise it will most likely end up being a different guy. Also try to make it late—that's extra cute! Do you have common interests? Are you around the same age? If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. Try talking about what motivates her; by doing so, you will create a bond between you two. Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward.  Don't ask her specifically to something and build it up. Instead, arrange something with a group of friends and say she is welcome to come along. That way, if she can't make it, no harm done and you can recover from the rejection without problems. When inviting her out, it has to be something fun that isn't a big deal for her to join in on. You want to avoid the awkward staring at your hands/feet mumbling about \\"what she is up to that weekend\\". If she is already dating someone, then that is her business, and you need to respect it. If she's obviously interested in someone else, then it might be worth your while to win her over—but do not get your hopes up. When you two start hanging out a lot, people will start talking and wondering if you two are dating or if you have a \\"thing.\\" If people ask you about it, just say, \\"we like hanging out,\\" or, \\"we have a lot of fun together.\\" Never say, \\"we are just friends.\\" This will give her the wrong impression. Ask her if she would like to hang out sometime, but don't make it sound like a date. As you spend more time with her, invite fewer and fewer people, so that eventually you can just say, \\"Want to hang out this weekend?\\" If she says no thanks, don't drop it yet. She is likely not comfortable enough with you, but she may come around if you keep talking to her. You could explain that it wouldn't be a date, just going to the movies as friends, or hanging out and going swimming. Summary:","output":"The article suggests building a friendship with a girl before asking her out by engaging in casual conversations, talking about her likes and dislikes, and remembering little things about her. Find common interests and discuss them, while also being considerate by doing nice things occasionally but not too often. Communicate through texting and chats, and spend time together in a group setting with other friends. Gradually reduce the number of people and invite her to hang out one-on-one without making it seem like an official date. Respect her current relationship status and be patient, as she may not initially feel comfortable hanging out alone. Focus on building a strong connection and deepening your understanding of each other's motivations before pursuing a romantic relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.

News article: Autopsy Cites ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug in Ruling Kayaker’s Death a Homicide The medical examiner’s conclusion is clear: Vincent Viafore, who the police say was killed by his fiancée during a kayaking trip on the Hudson River this past spring, was a victim of homicide caused by a “kayak drain plug intentionally removed by other.” But the lawyer for the fiancée, Angelika Graswald, said the medical examiner’s office had overstepped its bounds with that determination. He said it was based on police speculation, not an examination of Mr. Viafore’s body. “Clearly, the Orange County medical examiner failed to conduct any meaningful investigation of her own and relied on false information provided by the New York State Police,” the lawyer, Richard A. Portale, said on Thursday, referring to Jennifer L. Roman, who performed the autopsy for the medical examiner’s office in Orange County, N.Y. “She ruled this a homicide without a scintilla of medical evidence,” Mr. Portale added. He argued that the reference to the kayak plug in the autopsy report could prejudice a jury. Since May, when Mr. Viafore’s body was pulled from the Hudson, prosecutors have declined to identify a cause of death or release the autopsy. A copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times. It was unsurprising in some of its conclusions. It lists the cause of death as drowning (Mr. Viafore, 46, who was not wearing a life jacket, capsized in 46-degree water, cold enough to quickly cause hypothermia). The toxicology results attached gave his blood alcohol concentration as 0.066 percent, close to the legal limit of 0.08 and consistent with Ms. Graswald’s account that the couple, who shared an apartment in Poughkeepsie, paddled to Bannerman Island on April 19, where Mr. Viafore had a few beers. The autopsy offers a grim, methodical accounting of Mr. Viafore’s body, which was recovered from the middle of the river on May 23. His face and abdomen were bloated, the report says, and marked by a mottled red and green discoloration. Besides evidence of drowning, the only injuries noted in the report are a two-inch abrasion on the left torso and bruises on the lower chest and arm, also on the left side. The police have made no reference to a possible struggle between Mr. Viafore and Ms. Graswald, 35, while they were in their kayaks, though they have said Ms. Graswald moved his paddle out of his reach after he went in the water. Some legal experts agreed with Mr. Portale’s contention that the medical examiner’s conclusions had gone too far. Jeanine Pirro, a former district attorney in Westchester County who now hosts “Justice With Judge Jeanine” on Fox News Channel, said medical examiners typically gave the manner of death, whether accident, suicide, homicide or undetermined, without elaborating. “That is a very unusual way of describing manner of death,” Ms. Pirro said in a phone interview. “It’s rare that you get something next to the manner of death that is so outside the analysis of the body.” “Let’s assume that the drain plug was removed,” she added. “It doesn’t mean it’s a homicide. It could mean that it was removed by accident. What does that have to do with the drowning? If that’s what the medical examiner thinks, she’s going to have to back that up on the stand.” The medical examiner’s office referred questions about the report to the Orange County executive’s office. The county executive’s office defended the medical examiner’s actions. Justin Rodriguez, a spokesman for the county executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, said a medical examiner could use facts outside of the autopsy, citing a state law that addresses determinations about cause and manner of death. “Obviously this statute envisions that the autopsy is only one aspect of the medical examiner’s examination into the cause of death,” he said. “If medical examiners were limited to basing their conclusions solely on a physical examination of the body, there would be no coroner inquests. The coroners and medical examiners have been doing this for over 100 years.” The case has captivated residents of the Hudson Valley and beyond, for both its puzzling circumstances and the defendant’s behavior. For more than a week after Mr. Viafore’s drowning, the police described it as an accident. Ms. Graswald, meanwhile, was posting numerous photographs and videos to Facebook that showed her smiling broadly, doing cartwheels and kayaking. After Ms. Graswald was charged on April 30, the police said she had implicated herself in the killing. At a bail hearing later, they quoted her as having said, among other things, that it “felt good knowing he was going to die.” Mr. Portale, her lawyer, said his client’s statements to the police had been coerced. Complicating matters is the assertion by Mr. Portale that the kayak’s drain plug had been missing for some time. Kayaking experts have said that a missing plug would not necessarily cause a boat to sink because the hole it closes, at the top of the vessel, is so small. (Mr. Viafore’s kayak did not sink to the bottom of the river, and was later found near shore.) Such plugs, kayaking instructors say, are designed to make it easy to rid the kayak of excess water by flipping it over on dry land. In very choppy conditions, water can splash directly into the cockpit, causing the kayak to ride low in the water and making it unstable. Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert and chairman of the department of sciences at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, also found the reference to the kayak plug troubling, particularly the description that it was “intentionally removed by other.” Calling the reference a “red herring,” Dr. Kobilinsky said that medical examiners can and do consider police reports and other information besides the physical examination in arriving at a manner of death. However, he said, the leap from ruling a death a homicide to suggesting it was murder is not one a medical examiner should make. “That’s not something the medical examiner should be writing down,” he said of the reference to the plug’s intentional removal. “It already presumes it’s a murder. Homicide can be justified or not justified, or it can be an accident. It simply means that one person causes the death of another.” “The way it was written,” he added, “sounds like the medical examiner was saying it’s clearly a murder based on pulling the plug. But that’s a big hop, skip and a jump, and in a courtroom, all of this stuff will get dissected to the finest detail.” Correction: September 10, 2015 An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which the police say Angelika Graswald killed her fiancée, Vincent Viafore, during a kayaking trip. It was April 19, not April 10. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2015, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Intentionally Removed’ Plug Cited in Ruling Kayaker Death a Homicide.

Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. More significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals - an average of four goals a game. His haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series is a record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals.  Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona.  In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer.  In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season.

Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected.

United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\".

They help elaborate or clarify the specific provisions of the treaty without requiring any additional treaties or protocols. 2. Congressional-Executive Agreements: These agreements require approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate by a majority vote. They can be approved either before or after the treaty is signed by the President, allowing the legislative branch to have a say in the clarification or interpretation of treaty provisions. 3. Sole Executive Agreements: The President, acting alone, can execute these agreements without needing additional approval from the Senate or the House of Representatives. They provide the President with some flexibility in clarifying or implementing treaty provisions. In summary, when a treaty does not include all the necessary details, the gaps can be filled through various types of agreements (executive, congressional-executive, and sole executive agreements), which either involve the President independently or in collaboration with the legislative branch. These agreements help clarify and implement the details of the treaty under United States law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who hopes to use their superior intellect to become an inventor? ?  Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.

On your Xbox 360's Power button, there will most likely be one to four red flashing lights displaying around the perimeter of the button; these lights pertain to different problems. If you don't see an error code when you turn on the Xbox 360, skip ahead to the \\"Replace the power brick\\" step. Depending on the number of flashing quadrants, the problem could be one of four main things:   One red quadrant — Displays when a hardware component (e.g., the fan or a connected USB stick) stops working.  Two red quadrants — Signifies that your console has overheated. This will normally go away on its own, but you can take steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again.  Three red quadrants — Indicates that a serious error regarding one or more hardware components has occurred. This is the infamous \\"Red Ring of Death\\" error.  Full red circle — Indicates that an A/V connection has been lost. You won't see this for Xbox 360s which use HDMI cables. If you see one red quadrant light up on your Xbox 360's Power button, you'll also see an error code appear on the connected television. Since there are numerous codes you might see, the easiest way to address your specific error is by typing the error code followed by xbox 360 error into a search engine, selecting a reputable search result, and following the instructions. Unfortunately, you'll have to take your Xbox 360 in for repairs if you can't address the error by looking it up. While your console's two flashing red lights will disappear on their own after the console comes down in temperature, there are a few things you can do to prevent your console from overheating in the future:  Make sure the console has plenty of space in all directions. Lay your console horizontally, not vertically. Clean any dust out of the console's vents (you can use a damp cloth or a vacuum for this). Keep the console in a cool, dry place; avoid having it in the sun or near a heater. . The Red Ring of Death is somewhat non-specific, but you may be able to fix it by applying a new layer of thermal paste to your Xbox 360's heat sinks. As with most internal issues, the Red Ring of Death is a problem best left to professionals. The easiest way to fix this error is by using an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox 360 to your TV; if that isn't an option, check your current A/V cables to see how they're plugged in. If they're loose, tighten them and then restart your console.  If your A/V cables are fine, you'll need to replace them. If the error continues displaying even when using new A/V cables, your console's A/V input may be broken. You can either send your console in for repairs or switch over to a different display that allows you to use an HDMI cable. Microsoft's official policy for a CD drive that's stuck open is to wiggle the tray from side to side, wiggle it up and down, and then gently push it shut. If pressing the \\"Eject\\" button doesn't prompt the tray to pop out, you'll need to take the Xbox 360 in for service.  If the CD drive is stuck shut, you can try opening it by pushing a bent paper clip into the \\"Eject\\" hole on the front or back of the console. If this doesn't work, your Xbox 360 needs service. If the CD drive works but won't read two or more of your game discs, try removing any attached USB items. If it still won't read your discs, you'll need to take your Xbox 360 in for service. For problems not related to an error code (e.g., unexpected shut-downs), you may need to replace your Xbox 360's power source. This is because Xbox 360 power bricks have roughly 5 years of life before they begin to malfunction.  Malfunctioning power bricks can also cause your Xbox 360 to freeze or otherwise under-perform. If your Xbox 360 won't turn on even after replacing the power brick, check the USB slots to see if any of their connectors are bent. Bent connectors can cause the Xbox 360 to fail to turn on; if they are bent, prying them loose with a screwdriver may fix the problem. If you use an HDMI cable and your Xbox 360 isn't displaying video properly, you can try using a different HDMI cable to address the problem. Keep in mind that the problem may also lie with your TV, in which case you'll either need to use a different HDMI port on your TV or use a different TV entirely. If none of the above instructions have fixed the problem you're having with your Xbox 360, you'll need to send it in for repairs.","output":"This article talks about different problems you might face with your Xbox 360, like red flashing lights, and gives tips on how to fix them or when to take it for repairs."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here are the pop stars who tried their luck on the silver screen IT seems that being a successful musician isn’t enough these days. Rather than sticking with their original passion, many talented stars are adding even more strings to their bows and breaking into the acting industry. This week, it was reported that Rihanna is set to join the Oceans Eight all-star cast, while Jennifer Lopez had landed the role of cocaine queen Griselda Blanco for an upcoming HBO biopic too. They’re not the only ones. From rappers to rock stars, we take a look at some of the most memorable musicians that took the leap… Her incredible success in music has made her one of the most successful female solo artists of all time – but being Beyoncé, she wasn’t happy with simply selling 100million records worldwide. The star, who is married to Jay-Z, landed her first role in 2001 and has since starred in Austin Powers: Goldmember, The Pink Panther, Dreamgirls and Life is But a Dream. She's only 28 years old, but there's very little she hasn't done. As well as an astounding career in music, the Barbadian singer has starred in Battleship, Home and is rumoured to be joining the Ocean's Eight cast this year. He started his career as the MC of hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, but now Will Smith is better known as an award-winning actor. Some of his most notable movies include Men in Black, Hitch, Seven Pounds and, more recently, Suicide Squad. The pop princess gained notoriety through her music and after three successful albums, she starred in Crossroads. The 2002 film received mainly negative reviews, but still managed to make £47million at the box office. The former N'Sync star made a name for himself in music but, like Britney, starred in TV shows as a teenager. He utilised his acting talent after becoming famous, making the move to the silver screen in 2005 with a role alongside Morgan Freeman in Edison. He has since starred in The Social Network, Friends With Benefits and Bad Teacher, and continues to act today. Perhaps not quite as successful as her counterparts, Swifty made her acting debut with a minor role in Valentine's Day. The star, who is dating actor Tom Hiddleston, later lent her voice to The Lorax movie as Audrey and also made a cameo in 2014's The Giver. Now she seems to be now focusing her attention on her music career. It may come as a surprise to discover that the rapper has racked up countless acting roles in his career. Some of his performances include voicing the character of Smooth Move in Turbo and comedic roles in Starsky & Hutch and Scary Movie 5. The singer may have firmed up her status as a true icon through her music, but her movie roles speak for themselves. The star, who was previously married to director Guy Ritchie, has had over 20 film roles during her career, including those in Desperately Seeking Susan, Evita and Die Another Day. The actor formed the band Thirty Seconds to Mars back in 1998, running the show as the lead vocalist and songwriter. Meanwhile, he was making a name for himself in the acting world and played supporting roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and The Thin Red Line. He took a break to focus on his music, but later returned to movie making and quickly gained notoriety, winning awards for his talents. Leto's most notable performances include those in Dallas Buyers Club and Suicide Squad. The singer has worked hard on her acting career while simultaneously making music. She has since become a rom-com favourite, starring in Maid in Manhattan, Shall We Dance, The Wedding Planner and The Back-Up Plan. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Many successful musicians have ventured into the acting industry, with notable names such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Will Smith, Justin Timberlake, and Jennifer Lopez exploring diverse roles in film.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?, using the article: With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"In the early years of the Eurovision Song Contest, the event that was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network was the Swedish national selection competition for the Eurovision Song Contest, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final.

He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Question: Who did Roland pledged his love to?

He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.

No more 9.A","output":"In order to analyze the sentiment of the given tweet, it is essential to examine the mentioned text thoroughly, understand the context, and interpret the overall emotions expressed within the message. The tweet states: \\"It was fun while it lasted.. No more 9.A\\" Generally, sentiment analysis classifies text into three main categories: positive, negative, or neutral. In this case, the sentiment of the tweet appears to be a mix of both positive and negative emotions. Positive sentiment: The first part of the tweet, \\"It was fun while it lasted,\\" shows a sense of nostalgia or fond memories of a past experience that was enjoyable (fun) for the user. This expression indicates that they appreciated the time they spent in this particular situation or activity, making this part of the tweet convey a positive sentiment. Negative sentiment: The second part of the tweet, \\"No more 9.A,\\" communicates that the enjoyable experience has come to an end and the user is possibly sad or disappointed about it. The phrase \\"no more\\" signifies something is no longer occurring or available, which may give a sense of finality or loss, leading to a negative sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet is mixed, with an emphasis on positive reminiscing of the fun times that were had but a tinge of negativity due to the chapter's end. Depending on the context behind \\"9.A\\" and how important it is for the user, the tweet could lean more towards the negative side, showcasing a lament for the end of a happy period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Maybe my goal is to have a family. Being catholic naturally we gravitate towards larger families.

Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political.

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year.

Just moments earlier, she had so confidently handed it to Satina, speaking softly about its power, about its ability to trace Vane. And now, as Satina stared at the word so carelessly etched onto the side of the vessel, she could feel her heart pounding against her ribcage, struggling to escape the confines of her body. Death. The word seemed to echo around the small clearing, mixing with the howling wind that blew through the low branches of the surrounding trees. It was a warning, a cautionary label that underscored the threat this jar posed – not only to Vane but potentially to them all. Satina wondered if Hadja had fully understood the consequences of what she had done, of what she had so thoughtlessly brought into their midst. \\"What have you done, Hadja?\\" Satina whispered heatedly, her voice quivering with a mixture of fear and rage. \\"Why would you bring this? Do you even know what it means?\\" Hadja looked up from the jar, her eyes wide with surprise. Clearly, she hadn't expected Satina to react in such a way. \\"I – I didn't mean any harm,\\" she stammered, clutching the clay vessel to her chest. \\"I thought it might help us find Vane.\\" \\"You thought wrong,\\" Satina hissed, tearing her eyes from the chilling word on the jar's side and fixing Hadja with a venomous glare. \\"This... this thing,\\" she said, waving a trembling hand at the jar, \\"it's dangerous.\\" Hadja glanced down at the jar, frowning in confusion. \\"But how can it be? It's just a simple tracing spell, Satina,\\" she insisted, her voice small and wavering, as though even she was not entirely convinced by her own words. \\"I swear, I never meant for anything bad to happen.\\" Satina could see the genuine fear in Hadja's eyes, the pained desperation with which she clung to the belief that she had made a grave mistake. But even so, her anger could not entirely be assuaged. \\"We can't use this, Hadja,\\" she said firmly, her voice suddenly hard and unyielding. \\"Whatever spell this jar contains, it's not worth the risk.\\" Hadja looked as though she might argue, but ultimately, she nodded her head, the motion slow and heavy with defeat. \\"Very well,\\" she murmured, carefully setting the jar back down in the grass. \\"I'm... I'm sorry, Satina.\\" Satina watched her go, her body still trembling with the force of her emotions. As the other woman disappeared back into the treeline, Satina glanced once more at the jar, her gaze lingering on the word that had sent chills racing down her spine. Death. Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around herself, as if that might somehow protect her from the unknown dangers that now seemed to surround them. For the first time, Satina found herself questioning the lengths to which she and her friends were willing to go in their desperation to find Vane – and, more importantly, she began to wonder whether some lines were better left uncrossed. Unbeknownst to her, as Satina turned away from the jar and followed Hadja into the shadows of the forest, a thin, black tendril of smoke slowly began to rise from the vessel's firmly sealed lid, twisting and snaking its way into the darkness of the night sky."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important to note that having an address on a parcel does not necessarily reveal the complete identity of the sender, but it does provide some information that could potentially be traced back to the sender, making it less likely for the parcel to be truly anonymous.

But don't let the basic elements hold you captive. Be creative and make up your own power. If not, try considering things like electricity, superhuman strength, telekinesis, flight, ice, darkness (a good one), or anything you want. Combining more than one power is also possible, but don't make it too strong. Remember, the good guy should always win...for some reason. The whole \\"Taking Over The World\\" thing is outdated. Be more original. For example, Magneto (X-Men) was seen as evil because he was tired of humans treating him and all mutants like trash. Mr Freeze (Batman) had the whole story with his wife - if you watched the movie, you'd know. Nevertheless, let the villain have a good, genuine reason for being so mean (e.g. jealousy, alienation, revenge, protection). A laugh is a confirmation of their power, so it has to suit them. Pick it out carefully. You could choose the deep Dracula kind of chuckle for the guys, the high toned witch cackle could suit some females, but not all. Others would rather prefer the lower mysterious laugh, that is sometimes even confused with a giggle. There are countless choices. In complex plots, henchmen have their very own personalities and would not be considered as part of the super villain. But if the story is short and simple, a henchman can be limited. Give them a basic good quality - e.g. brains, strength, speed, obedience, bravery - and a basic bad quality - e.g. stupidity, clumsiness, cowardice. They don't have to look like the villain, but it would be good if they shared some characteristics or ideas. They could have, for example, the same goal and reason to be doing such dastardly crime. It could be a physical thing, like Achilles' heel, or a mental or inner flaw like greed or jealousy. He could have also been betrayed. But don't let it be an accident, his or her defeat. The point is to teach people that crime does not pay, so let his loss be by flaw. Throughout the story, show signs of his flaw, as Caesar showed signs of his arrogance throughout the Shakespearean play, and it was this flaw which caused him to die. He wasn't a Supervillain, but yours should, as Caesar, perish in the end. A betrayed friend or a spurned lover, if the rivalry is personal it makes for more intense battles.

Take a piece of scrap paper and pencil and list the necessary sections of your lab report in order. Under each section, jot a few sentences that summarize what must be covered in that section.  Due to the fact that different instructors have different preferences, you should check your lab report handout or course syllabus to verify expectations for the order and content of your report.  Most lab reports are organized, first to last: background information, problem, hypothesis, materials, procedure, data, and your interpretation of what happened as a conclusion. Technical aspects of your paper might require significant explanation. This may necessitate the use of subsections so that you can appropriately delve into and explain those nuanced aspects of your lab problem.  The organization of the body of your lab report will be specific to your problem/experiment. You may also have a separate section for the statement of your design methodology, experimental methodology, or proving subsidiary/intermediary theorems in your report.

Write highlights for this article: Vauxhall has been on a roll this week, announcing hundreds of new jobs in Britain ahead of the launch of the new Astra family hatchback, which is to be built at its factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. And it's also released details of the new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini. It's set for its official launch at the Paris Motor Show in October, priced from less than £10,000. Vauxhall is out to knock Ford's Fiesta off the top sales spot. The current Corsa — its best-seller — sold 83,000 in the UK in the past year, against around 121,000 Fiestas. Supercar: Vauxhall's new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini is set to launch in October. Although almost as long as the outgoing model, Vauxhall says almost every other aspect of the new car's design and engineering has been changed to 'significantly improve' it. That includes a re-designed instrument panel and dashboard and Vauxhall's IntelliLink communications system, which operates through a 7in colour touchscreen, is compatible with smartphones and incorporates extra features, such as voice command. The new model, pictured right, will be available with heated front seats, steering wheel and windscreen, as well as 'soft-tone' ambient lighting and an optional, full-size panoramic roof. Available in three and fivedoor versions, the next-generation Corsa has a new chassis, better suspension and speedsensitive power steering, while the chassis has been tuned for a smoother drive, with more precise steering, to cater for what Vauxhall calls Britain's 'unique and challenging topography'. Does it mean our crumbling, potholed roads? Star exhibit: Princess Diana's Austin Mini Metro will be on display at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional. A red Austin Mini Metro once owned by Princess Diana — and affectionately known as the 'Courting Car' — will be the star exhibit at an event that aims to be the antidote to all those posh, glittering supercar extravaganzas. Normally in Coventry Transport Museum, it makes its first public outing in around 20 years at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional later this month. Said to have been a gift from Prince Charles to the then Lady Diana Spencer during their courtship, the car will headline the first 'Concours de l'Ordináire' in Towcester, Northants. The event promises 'the finest collection of mauve interiors and beige exteriors ever brought together in one place', within a show that 'humorously celebrates the best examples of some of the most mundane British and European cars ever built' between 1968 and 1985. An spokesman said: 'The 1980 Metro is the final entry on a list of 50 truly unexceptional vehicles and highlights how a great era of ordinary cars has become endangered.' Other unexceptional specimens include a Peel P50, a three-wheeled micro-car, produced from 1962 to 1965, and an Austin Maestro — a distant cousin of the Metro — owned by the grand-daughter of the aristocrat who financed William Morris, to create his celebrated, eponymous company.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.  Guess a valid title for it!

Karine Charbonnier-Beck was hailed as a bold speaker of truth to power for her appearance three weeks ago on the TF1 programme Face aux Francais (Face to Face with the French), in which the president was questioned by members of the public. Her frank denunciation of the government's business policies, and refusal to be impressed by President Hollande's attempts to explain, made an instant hit. After being inundated with mostly complimentary tweets and emails from across the country, she has now been offered a regular slot on one of France's leading radio chat-shows. \\"I thought it was important to tell the president exactly what we have to go through as small business-owners,\\" she says in an interview at the Beck Industries factory in Armentieres, on the Belgian border. \\"When French people think about business, they automatically imagine rich tycoons and the CEOs of massive multinationals. \\"They don't realise that most of the work is done at a much more humble level. After the broadcast I got so many messages from viewers saying how refreshing it was to hear things from a different angle.\\" In the television programme, Ms Charbonnier-Beck upbraided the president for failing to understand the reality of running a business. She said that by simply moving a few kilometres across the frontier into Belgium, she could save Beck Industries â‚¬3m (3.7m/Â£2.3m) in taxes and charges every year. Her staff would also earn more because of lower payroll taxes. Ms Charbonnier-Beck said that President Hollande had failed to live up to his promise to simplify red tape. In fact, she said, there had been a process of \\"complexification\\"; and she urged a reform of the trade union system which, in its current form, hindered industrial relations. As for the president's responses, she says she was distinctly unimpressed. \\"I imagined that he would have come prepared for the event and used the section with me to announce some new initiative on business. But there was nothing of the kind. \\"I didn't have the feeling he was listening to anything I said. The answers had nothing to do with my questions. It is impossible to know what the president really thinks about anything. He says whatever he thinks the people he is with will want to hear.\\" Ms Charbonnier-Beck is the fourth generation of her family to run Beck Industries, which was set up in 1919 in a town destroyed in World War One. Armentieres, which lies a little south of Ypres, was on the frontline for four years. After meeting at one of France's top business schools HEC, she and her husband Hugues began at the company 20 years ago. Ten years ago they took over the reins from Karine's father. \\"After HEC we had the chance to go to the US. There was a choice: Harvard or Armentieres.  Naturally we chose Armentieres,\\" laughs Ms Charbonnier-Beck. With its crumbling industrial heritage and surrounding fields of Brussels sprouts, Armentieres may not be the most picturesque of locations. But it has provided a solid base for the business. Today the company owns factories at Aberdeen and Wolverhampton in the UK, as well as in Belgium and Germany. The factories all make heavy bolts and fastenings for use in the oil, gas and nuclear power industries. Overall Beck employs some 700 people. \\"We have been very impressed by the British approach to business. It is so very different from the French way,\\" says Hugues Charbonnier. \\"In France we are very good at mastering a core of competences and really excelling at them. But in the UK there is always the desire to move on, to try something new.  Probably the perfect world would involve a synthesis of the two approaches.\\" Karine says that she and her husband are very proud of what they have achieved. \\"We know we are a very good company,\\" she says. \\"But we need to invest if we are to stay ahead of the competition. And the only way we can do that is if we start making more profits. That means there have to be lower charges.\\" And has taking on the president had any effect? Has the publicity gone to her head? \\"Not a bit of it. I have started turning down requests for interviews and the radio appearance will only be one evening every couple of weeks,\\" she says. \\"It is important to get our message across. But work comes first.\\"","output":"A small business owner who publicly challenged French President Hollande's government policies gained national attention and became a radio chat-show contributor after her frank critique resonated with the public."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Whether it's for personal growth, career development or merely a hobby, pursuing an education presents the opportunity to expand our knowledge and capabilities. As a tutor or educator, it's vital to guide learners with a tailored approach to ensure they attain their educational goals. The following steps offer a solid framework for creating a goal-oriented timeline that can foster accelerated progress and satisfaction in any learner. Step 1: Inquire about their reasons for wanting to learn now Understanding the motivation behind a learner's decision to pursue a particular subject is crucial in devising a personalized educational plan. Start by asking questions based on their interests, career aspirations, and personal ambitions. This step enables the learner to reflect on the reasons behind their decision, which will affect their dedication and focus during the learning journey. As an educator, this insight helps you develop a tailored strategy that aligns with the learner's goals and aspirations. Whether the learner wants to advance in their career, pursue a personal passion or fulfill a long-held dream, your understanding of their motivation empowers you to deliver a stimulating and enriching learning experience. Step 2: Assess their current skill level Before diving into the learning process, it's essential to determine the learner's existing knowledge and skills. A comprehensive assessment helps you understand their strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. This information allows you to set realistic benchmarks and create a customized learning plan that caters to the individual's abilities. A variety of assessment methods can be employed, such as quizzing, observation, and self-assessment questionnaires. Employing a combination of these techniques will give you an all-encompassing understanding of the learner's current skills, enabling you to devise a tailored approach that maximizes their potential for success. Step 3: Create a goal-oriented timeline With a clear understanding of the learner's motivation and current abilities, it's time to establish a well-defined, goal-oriented timeline that maps out their learning path. Creating this timeline involves setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that account for their aspirations as well as any potential roadblocks. First, set short, medium, and long-term objectives that encompass various milestones, from acquiring specific skill sets to achieving broader educational goals. The timeline should be flexible enough to accommodate inevitable setbacks and be adaptable to the learner's progress and evolving interests. Next, identify resources and strategies needed to achieve these goals effectively. This might include textbooks, online resources, and hands-on training. As an educator, implement teaching techniques that cater to the learner's preferred learning style, be it visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, to enhance their engagement and retention of knowledge. Lastly, set up regular checkpoints throughout the timeline to assess the learner's progress, providing feedback and modifying the learning plan as needed. This will ensure the learner stays on track and feels supported throughout their journey. Conclusion By diligently following this approach, educators and learners can cultivate a mutually beneficial learning experience marked by both achievement and personal growth. Inquiring about the learner's reasons for pursuing education, assessing their current skill levels, and creating a clear, goal-oriented timeline collectively aim to empower individuals to conquer new skills and emerge as confident, well-informed members of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: what are organic semiconductors and what is concept of homo and lumo in organic semiconductor I found the following answer on Google: While such classic mechanisms are important locally, as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors , tunnelling, localized states, mobility gaps , and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction, particularly in polyacetylenes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"Although the text you provided from Google touches upon some aspects related to organic semiconductors, it does not paint a complete picture, nor does it address the concept of HOMO and LUMO. Let me provide you with a more comprehensive and detailed answer. Organic semiconductors are materials composed of organic molecules (molecules with carbon-based structures) that exhibit semiconducting properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity under certain conditions. These properties make organic semiconductors suitable for various applications, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells, and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Organic semiconductors can be made from small molecules or polymers and are generally characterized by their relatively low cost, flexibility, and adjustable properties. The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) concepts play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of organic semiconductors. In general, molecular orbitals represent the available electron energy levels within a molecule. The HOMO refers to the highest occupied energy level that is filled with electrons, while the LUMO represents the first available, empty energy level where an electron can be excited or promoted to. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO levels is known as the bandgap, which is an essential parameter in semiconductors, determining their electrical and optical properties. In organic semiconductors, the relatively localized nature of HOMO and LUMO levels leads to a wide bandgap that results in low charge carrier mobility and distinct optoelectronic properties compared to inorganic semiconductors. Charge transport in organic semiconductors often involves mechanisms like hopping and tunneling between localized states, which can be influenced by various factors such as molecular orientation, crystal or polymer packing, and phonon-assisted processes. In summary, organic semiconductors are carbon-based materials with semiconducting properties, and the concepts of HOMO and LUMO are crucial for understanding the behavior and properties of these materials. While the excerpt you found on Google does mention some of these concepts, it does not provide a complete representation of the topic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4-5, on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by David Akers and a 13-yard touchdown from Donovan McNabb to Jason Avant on a wide receiver screen pass. Down 10-0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker Robbie Gould successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10-9 at the half. In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12-10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to DeSean Jackson for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17-12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback Jay Cutler, who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end Kellen Davis for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back Matt Forte scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20-17. In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back LeSean McCoy on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24-20, the game's final score. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24-20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (Sunday Night Football on NBC) as when they had lost in week 4 of the 2008 season. Answer this question: How many yards longer was Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass compared to Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass?","output":"To find out how many yards longer Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was compared to Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass, we need to compare the lengths of the touchdown passes. Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass was a 13-yard pass to Jason Avant. Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was a 15-yard pass to Kellen Davis. To find the difference in yardage of the two touchdown passes, we subtract the length of McNabb's pass from the length of Cutler's pass: 15 yards (Cutler's pass) - 13 yards (McNabb's pass) = 2 yards Answer: Jay Cutler's only touchdown pass was 2 yards longer than Donovan McNabb's first touchdown pass."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are some concepts: city, look, stop What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Sure, here's a comprehensive interpretation using these concepts: city, look, and stop. A city is a large and densely populated urban area that often serves as the cultural, commercial, or political hub of a region or country. Cities often exhibit various unique characteristics in their architecture, culture, and vibe that differentiate them from one another - a charm that attracts both residents and tourists alike. Contemporary cities are characterized by skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, consistent with the modernistic architectural style that starkly contrasts with the Gothic and Baroque styles seen in older cities. They symbolize advancement and progress and represent the amalgamation of diverse cultures, ideas, and innovations. The concept of 'look' usually refers to the act of directing one's gaze towards something or someone, often to visually inspect or admire. In different contexts, 'look' might take on different meanings, but primarily it concerns sensory perceptual experience. It could be an integral part of appreciating cities where looking closely at cityscapes, landmarks, cultural precincts or everyday street life reveals the city's character, its soul. It allows us to perceive the aesthetics and energy of civic existence. For instance, travelers may gaze upon the cityscape of New York from the top of the Empire State Building to absorb the city's majesty and grandeur, perhaps encapsulated in the twinkling lights and the towering skyscrapers that seemingly touch the sky.  On the other hand, 'stop' refers to the action of ceasing movement or activity, often for a temporary period. Stop can be physical, like stopping at a red traffic light in a bustling city, signifying a pause in the haste of everyday life. But it can also be a state of emotional or mental cessation, often invoked to denote introspection or reflection. In the context of a city, for example, one may need to 'stop' amidst the city rush, look around, and soak up the vibrant city life. This cease in activity can also help preserve resources or mitigate environmental damage in cities; a concept famously implemented in cities like Paris and Bogota through the implementation of Car-Free days, where citizens are encouraged to stop using their cars for a day to reduce pollution. To summarize, the sentence integrating these three concepts could be: \\"In the heart of the bustling city, amid the humdrum of life and towering skyscrapers, one often finds the need to stop, look around, and admire the marvel of urban existence and its electrifying energy.\\" This sentence encapsulates the essence of these three concepts and their intricate interaction in defining our experiences in a cityscape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the suggested answer does not accurately address the specific question about the depth of the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it offers a general statement about the Atlantic Ocean being the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, it is important to address the actual depth of the Atlantic Ocean. The depth of the Atlantic Ocean varies greatly from one place to another, with its shallowest and deepest parts located at different points. On average, the Atlantic Ocean has a depth of about 3,339 meters (10,955 feet). However, its deepest point can be found in the Puerto Rico Trench, which plunges down to approximately 8,648 meters (28,373 feet) below the sea level. This subduction zone lies in the boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It is crucial to note that ocean depths are dynamic and complex, and can be influenced by various geographical factors and submarine geological formations such as underwater mountains, trenches, and rift valleys. The Atlantic Ocean, being the second-largest ocean in the world, covers an area of approximately 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,100,000 square miles), allowing for a diverse range of depths and underwater topographies. To appropriately validate the given answer, you should consider revising the response to include information about the Atlantic Ocean's average depth, its deepest point in the Puerto Rico Trench, and the dynamic nature of ocean depths influenced by geological factors. Such an answer would provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the depth of the Atlantic Ocean, ensuring that those relying on this information have a clearer picture to better comprehend the complex world beneath the ocean's surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. If a person rushes to respond or share their own opinions, they stand in the way of empathy. Hold mock conversations in which one person talks while the other person hears them out completely.  Encourage the listener to turn to face the speaker and make eye contact. The listener should be trying their best to understand what the other person is saying, not simply listening to reply. Those learning empathy need feedback to determine if they understand others' messages during communication. Saying what the person said back to them in a different way helps them double-check that they got the right message.  Paraphrasing may sound like, “From what I'm hearing, you seem very shocked and upset about the results of your doctor's exam. Is that right?” If the message was not received correctly, the speaker can try to relay it again so that the listener understands. Paraphrasing can also be taught in practice situations to help them feel confident doing it in real-life conversations. Identifying what someone is feeling can be challenging in the moment. To build the skill, start at the end: with the emotion you think the person felt. Then, reflect back and analyze other details, like facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and the actual words that were said.  For instance, if a wife guessed that her husband was angry, she might work backwards and recall that his arms were crossed, he was pacing, he had a sneer on his face, and his speech was overly sarcastic. Noting these details can help her read future nonverbal and verbal cues more easily. Help adults learn empathy by breaking down different scenarios and reflecting on the experiences of the people involved. This may work best by using scenes from popular movies or TV shows. For instance, a scene from a movie may portray two friends fighting. Have two people role-play the scene and discuss what each character may have been thinking and feeling, and what cues help you figure that out. Have everyone start by spending 5 or 10 minutes  breathing deeply and generating good vibes about themselves. This might include silently repeating affirmations, like “I am worthy,\\" or simply envisioning giving oneself a warm hug.  In subsequent meditation sessions, they can start focusing on a friend or family member. Radiate positive thoughts towards that one person for the full exercise—just for about 10 minutes. After focusing on loved ones for a few sessions, they can then progress to radiating good vibes to a virtual stranger, such as the nice barista at Starbucks or someone they heard about on the news. Loving-kindness helps connect with the deeper human side of oneself and others, increasing a person's ability to feel empathy. Summary:","output":"1. Conduct mock conversations in which a listener focuses on understanding the speaker rather than responding. This includes making eye contact and facing the speaker. 2. Teach paraphrasing to ensure the listener understands the message correctly, allowing them to double-check their understanding. 3. Practice identifying emotions by analyzing facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and words spoken along with the emotions they represent. 4. Use role-playing scenarios, like scenes from movies or TV shows, to help adults analyze the emotional experiences of characters and learn empathy. 5. Encourage practicing loving-kindness meditation, starting with oneself, then focusing on friends, family, and eventually strangers, to help connect with the deeper human side of individuals and improve empathy skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out.

I think that there was not a lot of consideration in picking the music that went with the different animal groups. The frames/views change very quickly throughout the whole video.

Short movie review: at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The phrase \\"at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age\\" used by the critic generates a vague sentiment about the movie, thus making it difficult to decisively discern if the critic was leaning positive or negative in their review. How the statement is interpreted mostly depends on the context in which it was deployed. If the critic is citing this deceleration of pace as a tool that the filmmakers used to allow a deeper immersion into the character development or intricacies of the plot, then it would denote a positive sentiment. Here, the slowed pace would be perceived as an advantage that enhances the viewing experience by offering the audience the time and space to dwell more deeply into the movie's narrative. In such a case, the critique could be taken as appreciation for the director's courage to defy the more popular fast-paced thrillers or action-packed movies. Perhaps, in this context, the slow pace signified the filmmaker's desire to promote reflection and contemplation, creating a unique rhythm preferred by movie lovers who enjoy thoughtful and nuanced storytelling. Conversely, if the critic found the movie to be boring, sluggish, or lacking momentum due to this reduced tempo, then the sentiment would likely tilt towards negative. In this scenario, the phrase suggests that the movie moved at such a slow pace that it could test the patience of viewers, especially those in middle age who might be accustomed to or prefer livelier narratives. If the slow pace failed to serve an artistic purpose and instead felt dull and dreary, the movie could come across as monotonous or tedious. Furthermore, the statement could also suggest that the critic felt that the themes or storylines of the movie were out of sync or unrelatable to their age or generation, rendering the movie somewhat stagnant or not in alignment with their personal preferences or the societal experiences that resonate with them. Overall, without additional context or information, it's challenging to determine unequivocally whether the critic's impression of the movie was positive or negative based solely on the phrase \\"at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age.\\" It suggests that the pace of the movie was slow – but whether this was a positive or negative factor largely depends on the critic's personal preferences and the broader context of their review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage  \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\",  answer the following question.

Q:-  Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is usually the generation of electricity.  Let's delve a bit deeper into this entire process:  1. Coal Burning: The coal is brought to the power station where it is then crushed into powder as this increases its surface area, and hence its combustion rate. The crushed coal is then burned in a furnace. 2. Production of Steam Under Pressure: When the coal burns, the chemical energy is converted to heat energy. This heat energy is utilized to convert the water into steam inside the boiler. The steam is produced under high pressure. 3. Flow into a Turbine: The pressurized steam is transferred into a turbine. The heat energy in the steam is converted into kinetic energy as it expands and rushes against the blades of the turbine. This results in the movement or rotation of the turbine blades.  4. The Turbine Spins: The turbine's blades are coupled to the shaft of a generator. This means that when the steam turbine’s blades rotate, the generator also rotates. 5. Generation of Electricity: In the final step, when the rotating turbine spins the generator, it induces a flow of electrical charges in the generator’s windings, generating electricity. The generators work using Faraday's principle of electromagnetic induction which states that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force in a conductor. This process effectively converts mechanical energy (the spinning of the turbine) into electrical energy. So, the last step is often the electrical output from the generator is delivered to the homes and businesses that require it by distribution systems called power grids. By going through these steps, the original chemical potential energy stored within the coal is delivered to many power users as electrical energy.  Of course, it is important to mention that this process also includes some auxiliary steps, such as the cooling of the steam after it has left the turbine to condense the steam back into water so it can be reused in the boiler. It is also crucial to note that not all kinetic energy of the steam can be utilized to produce mechanical energy in the turbine – a majority of it gets lost as waste heat. Modern power stations have measures in place to control or reduce these losses to improve efficiency.  Thus, the process of converting coal into electricity is quite complex with multiple stages, but the ultimate goal is to generate electricity safely and as efficiently as possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who was illiterate? Context: Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya. His family came from a small, relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985), and his mother was named Aisha (died 1978); Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins, they were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943, although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life. He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate.

A \\"skybike\\", a one-man, open-cockpit flying machine, attacks Dogen. Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved. Dogen leaves and comes upon a group of miners beating a captured nomad soldier. Dogen assists him, and the miners turn hostile. Dogen is out-gunned until Rhodes helps him defeat the miners.

Cohen is seeking 250,000 in damages, alleging that the inadequate accommodations \\"ruined his summer.\\" Body: A legal feud has sparked between Michael Cohen, a top executive within the Trump Organization, and Dr. Ali Guy, an NYU physician, over a rented Hamptons luxury home. Cohen claims he had negotiated a 150,000 agreement with the professor to secure the vacation property during August, in hopes of providing a comfortable retreat for his family.  However, Cohen's expectations were shattered when the house failed to deliver several key amenities promised in their agreement. Upon arriving at the residence on August 2, Cohen and his family found the air conditioning units were not functional. Furthermore, he found the beds in the home were allegedly too small for his family's needs. In response to the property's numerous shortcomings, Cohen sued Dr. Guy for a sum of 250,000, alleging the professor had \\"ruined his summer.\\" According to the lawsuit, Cohen claims the property's issues prevented him and his family from enjoying a relaxing vacation, which was the main motivation behind renting the high-end Hamptons home.  The property in question, known for its luxurious features and prime location, is valued at approximately 8 million. Situated within the upscale community of the Hamptons, the home attracts affluent renters seeking a lavish summer escape. Despite the home's reputation and immense price tag, Cohen believes it did not provide the comfort and relaxation his family had anticipated. The plaintiff's attorney, Samuel Rosen, revealed that Cohen's party had emphasized the importance of working air conditioning and adequately sized beds to the landlord before finalizing the rental agreement. However, Cohen alleges these concerns were not met, resulting in discomfort and dissatisfaction for his family. This legal dispute highlights the high stakes at play when dealing in luxury real estate rentals. The increasingly competitive vacation rental market is no stranger to conflicts between tenants and landlords. In this case, the disagreement could result in a significant financial loss or tarnished reputation for either party. As the lawsuit progresses, the case will shed light on the potential repercussions from renting luxury properties and might serve as a cautionary tale for both landlords and renters alike. There has not yet been a public statement or response from Dr. Ali Guy regarding the allegations and lawsuit filed by Michael Cohen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Britain's third biggest grocery chain is to take its battle into the courtroom by requesting a judicial review against a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that rejected its complaint over the Tesco pledge. The move comes after Sainsbury's lost an appeal against the ASA decision earlier this month, when a report by the watchdog's independent reviewer Sir Hayden Philips backed the ASA findings. Sir Hayden agreed with the ASA, although he said OPTIONS: - ASA's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Advertising Standards Authority's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Britain's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Hayden Philips's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Price Promise's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Sainsbury's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Sam Webb's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Supermarket Sainsbury's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues. - Tesco's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues.","output":"- Advertising Standards Authority's had made a 'persuasive case' that customers increasingly place value on provenance and other ethical issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The proposals, set out by global financial regulators are designed to avoid the need for taxpayers to bail out the banks in a future crisis. Instead investors will be required to accept a loss on their investments. Leaders of the G20 group of nations will be asked to endorse the reforms. Under the proposals drawn up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), chaired by UK Bank of England governor Mark Carney, banks will be required to issue \\"buffer bonds\\" by 2019 equivalent to 16% of the risk-weighted assets they hold, rising to 18% in 2022. Such assets can include government debt and cash. In the event of a financial crisis the value of those bonds could be written down and used to raise funds for the bank. As a result investors in those bonds would bear the burden of keeping the bank solvent by taking a \\"haircut\\" or loss on their investments. The reform means investors will be the first to take a financial loss before taxpayers are asked to bail out the bank in question. The \\"buffer bonds\\" are the last major reform to be announced by the FSB since the G20 tasked it with introducing changes to the regulate the banking industry in 2009. The FSB has since increased bank capital requirements and imposed restrictions on bankers' bonuses. Mr Carney said many key reforms have already been implemented. \\"As a consequence, the financing capacity to the real economy is being rebuilt and significant retrenchment from international activity has been avoided,\\" Mr Carney said in a letter to G20 leaders ahead of their summit next week. The FSB believes the reforms will allow a big bank to fail without creating the level of panic in financial markets after Lehman Brothers went under in 2008. The \\"buffer bonds\\", known as Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity or TLAC, are on top of the minimum core capital requirements a bank must already hold. The FSB is also assessing the risks to financial stability from the activities of big asset managers and said it would publish recommendations \\"as necessary in the first half of 2016\\". Summary:","output":"Global financial regulators have proposed reforms to end the \\"too big to fail\\" banks phenomenon, preventing the need for taxpayers to bail out banks in future crises.

Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in shtetls, maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and scorned the life-style of their neighbors; and all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of antisemitism.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Based on the given passage, a good question to test students' understanding and reading comprehension could be: How did the various factors contribute to the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe? This question requires students to identify and examine the factors mentioned in the passage that explain the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe. The answer should address the following factors mentioned in the passage: 1. Alien surroundings: The passage suggests that the unfavorable environment in central and eastern Europe made it difficult for Jews to assimilate. 2. Contempt: Despite some assimilation taking place, contempt from their surroundings had a limiting impact on Jewish assimilation. 3. Living in shtetls: Jews primarily lived in small, isolated communities, which made it difficult for them to assimilate into the larger society. 4. Strong system of education for males: The importance placed on education allowed the Jews to maintain their cultural identity and resist assimilation. 5. Rabbinic leadership: Jewish communities adhered to their religious leaders, which allowed them to preserve their customs and traditions. 6. Scorn for the life-style of their neighbors: Jews were not attracted to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish neighbors, which reduced their motivation to assimilate. 7. Antisemitism: Every outbreak of antisemitism further strengthened the Jews' desire to maintain their distinct identity and resist assimilation. To answer this question effectively, students would need to extract key information from the passage, demonstrate their understanding of the factors mentioned, and explain how these factors contributed to the limited assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe.

Article: At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders   David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator  of single gender education says, \\" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret  the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts  ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" Question: What is David Chadwell's attitude towards separating primary boys and girls while learning?

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity.

Select from: (I) unacceptable (II) acceptable","output":"I would rate this sentence as (II) acceptable from a linguistic standpoint, but it may require clarification for some listeners or readers. The sentence possesses the necessary components to demonstrate a complete thought, including a subject (the president), verb (appointed), direct object (press secretary), and indirect object (Smith). The parts of speech are used correctly, and the sentence adheres to typical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in the English language. Moreover, there is no glaring issue with grammar, syntax, or semantics. However, it is essential to note that this rating does not preclude any ambiguity in the sentence. The primary concern here is the usage of \\"press secretary\\" and \\"Smith.\\" The phrasing could imply that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary or that they assigned one press secretary to Smith, who might have another position. The sentence's ambiguity could be clarified by adding the appropriate preposition or rephrasing the sentence structure. If the sentence is meant to convey that the president appointed Smith as the press secretary, it could be revised to: \\"The president appointed Smith as the press secretary\\" or \\"The president made Smith the press secretary.\\" Alternatively, if the sentence aims to express that the president assigned a press secretary to Smith, who holds another position, it could be restructured as: \\"The president appointed a press secretary for Smith\\" or \\"The president assigned a press secretary to Smith.\\" In conclusion, while a linguist may rate the sentence as acceptable, it may still benefit from additional context or revision to avoid any potential confusion or misinterpretation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws.  - Cousin Island is a small granitic island of the Seychelles, lying west of Praslin. It is a nature reserve protected under Seychelles law as a Special Reserve. It is managed by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization and Partner of BirdLife International, by which it has been identified as an Important Bird Area.  - Constantine Walter Benson OBE (England, 2 February 1909  Cambridge, England, 21 September 1982) was a British ornithologist and author of over 350 publications. He is considered the last of a line of British Colonial officials that made significant contributions to ornithology.  - A wildlife refuge, also called a wildlife sanctuary, is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation or competition; it is a protected area, a geographic territory within which wildlife is protected.  - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.  - The University of Bristol (abbreviated as Bris. in post-nominal letters, sometimes referred to as Bristol University) is a red brick research university located in Bristol, United Kingdom. It received its royal charter in 1909, and its predecessor institution, University College, Bristol, had been in existence since 1876.  - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - The Comoros ('), officially the Union of the Comoros (Comorian: \\"Udzima wa Komori,\\" , '), is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar. Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast. Its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comore. The Union of the Comoros has three official languages  Comorian, Arabic and French. The religion of the majority of the population is Islam.  - A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid. The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax.  - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha.   - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it.  - Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London. The first radio broadcast was made on 15 March 1932, and the building was officially opened two months later, on 15 May. The main building is in Art Deco style, with a facing of Portland stone over a steel frame. It is a Grade II* listed building and includes the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience, and lobby that was used as a location for filming the 1998 BBC television series \\"In the Red\\".  - Seychelles (; French: ), officially the Republic of Seychelles (Creole: \\"Repiblik Sesel\\"), is an archipelago and country in the Indian Ocean. The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, Réunion (region of France) and Mauritius to the south. With a population of roughly 92,000, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country; however, it does have a larger population than the British overseas territory Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Aldabra is the world's second-largest coral atoll. It is situated in the Aldabra Group of islands in the Indian Ocean that are part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, with a distance of southwest of the capital, Victoria, on Mahé Island.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Mainz is the capital and largest city of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. It was the capital of the Electorate of Mainz at the time of the Holy Roman Empire. In antiquity Mainz was a Roman fort city which commanded the west bank of the Rhine and formed part of the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire; it was founded as a military post by the Romans in the late 1st century BC and became the provincial capital of Germania Superior. The city is located on the river Rhine at its confluence with the Main opposite Wiesbaden, in the western part of the Frankfurt Rhine-Main; in the modern age, Frankfurt shares much of its regional importance.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.  - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s).  - Malcolm Penny is a British zoologist who is known for his ornithological field work on Aldabra and the Seychelles .

Texas Rangers Gene Autry and Frog Millhouse are traveling undercover as western troubadours in search of the killer of old, half-blind Frank Martin. Their only clues are a guitar string (the murder weapon) and Martin's horse Swayback that hold the key to finding the dead man's lost goldmine. Following Frank Martin's funeral, Martin's granddaughter, Joan, meets her uncle, John Martin, and Lon Dillon, who flirts with her. Lawyer Henry Nolan reads Martin's will, revealing that the deceased left John 5,000 and the remainder of the estate to Joan. John tells Joan that he suspects Gene of her grandfather's murder and persuades her to hold a masquerade dance to lure Gene into town.

Here is a hypothesis: The Chinese new year is less significant that the Hindu new year. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the given premise, we need to break down the elements involved in the statement and examine them closely. Premise: Chithirai Vishu (Hindu New Year) is a more religious affair than the Chinese, with worship and prayers. Hypothesis: The Chinese new year is less significant than the Hindu new year. The premise suggests that Chithirai Vishu, the Hindu New Year, has a higher degree of religious involvement compared to the Chinese New Year, mainly through worship and prayers. However, the significance of a celebration is a broader concept that encompasses various aspects such as cultural, historical, social, and economic dimensions, apart from the religious aspect. While the premise focuses on the religious aspect of both New Year celebrations, it doesn't provide any information about the other aspects, which also contribute to the overall significance of the respective celebrations. Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, is abundant with cultural and historical elements. It's a time of family reunions, honoring ancestors, giving gifts, and feasting. The customs and traditions associated with the Chinese New Year are deeply rooted in the society and are celebrated with great enthusiasm. Similarly, Chithirai Vishu or the Hindu New Year carries its importance not only in religious practices but also in cultural, traditional, and social aspects. It is a time of new beginnings, cleaning homes, and welcoming prosperity. Worshipping and praying to deities form just one part of this celebration. Based on the premise, it's true that Chithirai Vishu seems to have a more significant religious component than the Chinese New Year. However, this alone cannot lead to the conclusion that the Chinese New Year is less significant overall than the Hindu New Year. The hypothesis would be valid if we specify that it's based on the religious aspect alone, but it's essential to consider other aspects to make an accurate comparison. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis as it only compares the religious aspect of both the New Year celebrations. To establish the validity of the hypothesis, one would have to dive deeper into the cultural, social, historical, and economic aspects of both celebrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Toamasina , meaning \\"like salt\\" or \\"salty\\", unofficially and in French also Tamatave, is the capital of the Atsinanana region on the east coast of Madagascar on the Indian Ocean.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

Movie title: Man on a Ledge Movie plot: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room at the top floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below sees him and calls the police. They isolate the area, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick says he will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence after failing to convince a depressed policeman not to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge a month earlier.Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman who was arrested for stealing a 40-million diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick has escaped from prison, where he was serving 25 years for the heist, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral a week earlier. Nick, however, says he is innocent and reveals that Englander used to employ cops to protect his multi-floor jewelry business. One day, while Nick was escorting Englander and the diamond, he was knocked unconscious by two men in ski masks. He awakened to find that Englander had framed him for stealing the diamond in order to get the insurance money, as he had lost his fortune during the stock market crisis.Unbeknownst to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) break into Englander's upper floor jewelry vault in the building across the street to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the security of the jewelry store to check the vault. Although Joey and Angie are able to evade them, they don't find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond from another safe that they did not know about,...

Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released in mid 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Recognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: \\"Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'\\". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.  In addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles--partitions separating the musicians so that there was \\"an ambience fit for an ensemble\\". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, \\"as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart\\". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.  On the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded \\"Visions of Johanna\\", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of \\"4th Time Around\\" which made it onto the album and a take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" which did not.  On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4 a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition \\"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\". Kenny Buttrey recalled, \\"If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?\\" The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.  The next session began similarly--Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\\". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.

Paragraph: Orange JS, Du W and Falsey AR (2015) Therapeutic immunoglobulin selected for high antibody titer to RSV also contains high antibody titers to other respiratory viruses. Specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations. A polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses. While donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against RSV, the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products (p ≤ 0.01 to p ≤ 0.001). To consider this as a donor-specific attribute, 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the RSV antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers: donors with high RSV titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses. These findings suggest either some humoral antiviral response bias or more frequent viral exposure of certain individuals.
