Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

Question: Given the below context:  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Horace Mann (May 4, 1796 - August 2, 1859) was an American educational reformer and Whig politician dedicated to promoting public education. A central theme of his life was that \\"it is the law of our nature to desire happiness. This law is not local, but universal; not temporary, but eternal. It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception.\\" In September 1852, he was nominated for governor of Massachusetts by the Free Soil Party, and the same day was chosen president of the newly established Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio. Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death. There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first woman faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, Rebecca Pennell, his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to \\"be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity\\".  Antioch College was founded by the Christian Connexion which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting. Mann himself was charged with nonadherence to sectarianism because, previously a Congregationalist by upbringing, he joined the Unitarian Church.  He collapsed shortly after the 1859 commencement and died that summer. Antioch historian Robert Straker wrote that Mann had been \\"crucified by crusading sectarians.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented \\"what seems the fatal waste of labor and life at Antioch.\\" Mann's wife, who wrote in anguish that \\"the blood of martyrdom waters the spot,\\" later disinterred his body from Yellow Springs.

In 1852, he was nominated for the position of governor of Massachusetts by the Free Soil Party and simultaneously chosen to be the president of the newly established Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio. Although he didn't win the election for governor, he accepted the college presidency and held the position until his death. At Antioch College, Mann taught subjects such as economics, philosophy, and theology. He was known for being popular with students and with the general public who attended his lectures on promoting public schools. Throughout his tenure at Antioch College, Mann also made strides in gender equality, as demonstrated by hiring Rebecca Pennell, his niece, who became the first woman faculty member to receive equal pay with her male colleagues. The college faced financial struggles and sectarian conflicts during Mann's time as president, however, which ultimately took a significant toll on him.

But it wasn't until I saw  this  Slashdot story on the same subject that I knew I had to get my  thoughts down. A lot of sites are suffering from a big problem  mdash;  they are being systematically hammered by RSS newsreaders for new material  at regular intervals.        When I first came across RSS around two years ago and did some reading  up on it, it sounded like another interesting protocol for a nonproblem.  I wondered what was wrong with just refreshing a \\"What's new?\\" page.  (I have a natural scepticism towards new and exotic protocols.) Nonetheless,  after RSS established a niche in the realm of informing us,  rolling news style, of new network content, I recognised its usefulness  in this situation. I did still feel that its design was suboptimal, no  matter how many thousands of bloggers now relied on it.

Although he died several years ago, I can still remember the days we spent together and what he has taught me about love. I have two apple trees in the garden. Prana loved apples. When he went outside, he'd catch an apple and take it into the house to eat later. The apples had been on the ground and were often dirty so I wasn't always happy that Prana had brought them into the house. It was an autumn day in America, but it was very cold. A big snow fell and we had not done anything for its coming. On that special day, Prana went outside and I watched him through the window.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who are shadowed and questioned in Taiji by local police? Title: The Cove Movie plot: The film follows former dolphin trainer and activist Ric O'Barry's quest to document the dolphin hunting operations in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \\"Flipper\\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.[7] Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \\"Keep Out\\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local Japanese government officials are involved in the hiding of the hunting, and the Japanese public is not fully aware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat. The film states that the dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury and interviews two local...","output":"Ric O'Barry and his crew, including director Louie Psihoyos, are shadowed and questioned by local police in Taiji."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"Four people walking across thick snow during a sunset.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Four people are walking across the snow to get home.\\"?","output":"While the statement \\"Four people walking across thick snow during a sunset\\" provides some context about the people and their situation, it does not necessarily logically follow that \\"Four people are walking across the snow to get home.\\" The provided information allows us to visualize the scene but does not give us enough information to determine their specific purpose or destination. There could be a number of possible reasons why these four people are walking across the thick snow. It could be for recreational purposes, such as taking a hike or exploring the snowy landscape. On the other hand, they might be involved in a search and rescue mission, meaning they might not be heading back to their own homes but instead are looking for someone else in need of assistance. It is also possible that these individuals are participating in a winter sports activity, such as snowshoeing or cross-country skiing, and are just enjoying the experience of being outdoors during a beautiful sunset. Alternatively, they could be walking to a different destination entirely, such as a cabin or shelter for the night, a social event in a nearby village, or a gathering point for a group activity. Furthermore, the sunset itself is just another piece of information that describes the scene but does not inherently imply that the individuals are heading home due to the time of day. Sunset can evoke a sense of tranquility or even urgency in some cases, but it does not inherently mean that people are on their way back to their homes during this period. In conclusion, the statement \\"Four people walking across thick snow during a sunset\\" does not provide enough context for us to logically infer that they are indeed walking across the snow to get home. There could be a variety of alternative reasons or destinations for their journey, requiring more detailed information before arriving at any specific conclusions about their objectives or destinations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jack Porter, a former bomb disposal expert with a troubled past, moves to Stanton to escape his demons and start anew. His life takes a sudden turn when his dog, Max, unearths a mysterious suitcase by the lakeside while on a walk. Act 2: The Discovery Curiosity piqued, Jack takes the suitcase home and opens it, only to find that it contains a highly advanced explosive device, unlike anything he's encountered before. His expertise tells him that the explosive has the power to level the entire town. Jack contacts his former mentor, Sarah Thompson, who now works as a Homeland Security agent, to report the situation. Sarah arrives in town and informs Jack about a rogue group of domestic terrorists, The Cause, who have stolen an experimental explosive and are planning to use it to bring attention to their objectives. The terrorist group is led by a sinister and enigmatic figure named Victor Kane. Their goal is to create chaos and destabilize the country, believing that the government has become corrupt and needs a complete overhaul. Act 3: The Race Against Time Now aware of the gravity of the situation, Jack and Sarah join forces to track down The Cause and neutralize the threat. Following a trail of cryptic clues left by the terrorists, they uncover a complex and sinister plan, with Stanton being only one of several targets across the nation which are to be targeted simultaneously.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process you described refers to the process of desalination, which is the removal of salt and other impurities from water in order to make it safe and potable. This is accomplished by evaporating the water and leaving the salt behind in the original pot. The process involves the following steps: 1. Place the water in a pot. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover. 3. Place a larger pot under the first. 4. Heat water to evaporation. 5. Water vapor will collect on the lid. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: \\"Suppose more salt will drip inside the fresh water pot. How will it affect more salt being removed from the water? Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\\" If more salt were to drip into the fresh water pot, there could be a few effects on the process as a whole: 1. Insufficient Separation: If the salt manages to travel to the fresh water pot, it might indicate that the separation of salt and water was not efficient enough. To address this, the process may need to be changed or optimized. For example, using a better-fitting lid, increasing the distance between the pots, or employing a more efficient heat source to encourage complete water evaporation could help ensure that salt and water are thoroughly separated. 2. Contaminated Fresh Water: If more salt makes it into the freshwater pot, the desalination process would be less successful as the fresh water produced would have higher levels of salinity. This could mean that the fresh water is not suitable for consumption or other intended uses until additional purification processes are performed. 3. Increased Processing Time: With more salt present in the fresh water, additional measures might have to be taken to ensure that the water is purified. This could lead to an extended processing time that would consume more energy and resources overall. 4. Measurement Variability: The supposed perturbation may also have an indirect effect on the process, specifically with regard to how salt levels are measured and monitored. If more salt drips into the fresh water pot, it may give an inaccurate picture of the effectiveness of the desalination process. Improved monitoring and analysis techniques may be required to ensure that the process is working optimally and to flag any potential issues. In conclusion, if more salt were to drip into the fresh water pot, the overall desalination process could be negatively impacted through insufficient separation, contaminated fresh water, increased processing time, and measurement variability. The perturbation hypothesis, therefore, does have both direct and indirect effects on the desalination process, and addressing these concerns would be necessary to optimize the process and ensure the production of high-quality, fresh water."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

But he's vowing to continue the committee's work until more questions are answered.

Article:","output":"Title: Prominent Uighur Scholar Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Separatism in China Introduction: A Chinese court has convicted a renowned Uighur scholar on charges of separatism and has sentenced him to life imprisonment, according to his lawyer. The controversial verdict has drawn international criticism and concern over the treatment of the Uighur minority in China. Background: The Uighur population, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group, primarily resides in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. The region has experienced sporadic violence and unrest in recent years, which Chinese authorities attribute to Islamist extremism and separatist groups. However, Uighur activists and international human rights organizations argue that the tensions stem from the Chinese government's repressive policies and discrimination against the Uighur minority. The Case: The prominent Uighur scholar, whose name has not been disclosed, was arrested in 2014 and subsequently charged with promoting separatist ideologies. The prosecution accused him of organizing and disseminating pro-separatist materials, including books and articles, advocating for an independent Uighur state. His defense lawyer argued that his client's work was solely academic and intended to foster dialogue on Uighur history, culture, and identity. The Verdict: The court found the scholar guilty of separatism, disregarding defense arguments that his work was non-political and academic in nature. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, a move that has sparked widespread criticism from human rights organizations and advocates around the world. International Reaction: The verdict has been condemned by numerous international institutions and human rights organizations. They argue that the scholar's case represents an infringement on freedom of speech and academic freedom, in addition to raising concerns about the broader pattern of discrimination against the Uighur minority. Several nations, including the United States and European Union, have urged China to reevaluate the ruling and release the Uighur scholar. Chinese Government's Response: The Chinese government has defended its decision, claiming that the scholar's actions posed a serious threat to national unity and security. They argue that the court's ruling is justified and in line with Chinese laws dealing with separatism and other extremist activities. Implications for the Uighur Community: The life imprisonment of the prominent Uighur scholar has created renewed fears among the Uighur community in China. The harsh sentencing of an intellectual, who was merely conducting research on their history and culture, may discourage other scholars from pursuing similar work. This could lead to further marginalization of the minority group and stifle much-needed dialogue about their rights and cultural preservation. Conclusion: The life sentence handed down to the Uighur scholar presents a chilling message to intellectuals and minority communities in China. The case serves as a stark reminder of the country's stringent restrictions on freedom of speech and academic freedom. As international condemnation continues to mount, one can only hope that China will reconsider its stance on such matters and work towards a more inclusive and diverse society that values intellectual discourse and cultural understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Right from the moment we entered, the warm and inviting atmosphere welcomed us, creating a perfect setting for a memorable evening. Our server, Amanda, was genuinely attentive and accommodating. She not only provided insightful recommendations for both food and wine pairings but also ensured that our every need was met throughout the evening. We ordered the seared scallops for starters, which were cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. For our main course, the filet mignon and the butternut squash ravioli left us in awe with their exquisite flavors and culinary artistry. What sets Bistro Jubilee apart is their commitment to using local, fresh ingredients, which reflect in the quality and taste of their dishes. The dessert, a heavenly chocolate lava cake, was the perfect way to end a fantastic meal. The only minor suggestion I have is that the noise level could be a bit lower to make conversations easier. However, this didn't detract from the overall exceptional experience we had. I highly recommend Bistro Jubilee to anyone looking for a high-quality dining experience with exceptional service in a charming ambiance. We will definitely be returning for more special occasions in the future!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. According to IMDb Takashi Miike's Master of Horror-segment, Imprint, was banned in the US. So I figured I'd translate the Swedish review I just wrote for it... It was hard to NOT have any sort of expectations from Ichi The Killer-director Takashi Miike's episode in the Masters of Horror series. And the DVD-cover of Imprint did in deed look very promising. The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese bordello, some time during the 19th century, and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for Komomo, the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for. Tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello, hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and quiet girl, know about Komomo, and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow... The first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent American-English. But I will leave it at that, it's not that big a deal. What IS a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was. Miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that I couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. The extended torure-scene, that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, felt so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even THAT scene became interesting. I felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - with no sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water...and, in all honesty, the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust. The journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago, for me most memorable as Frank Nitti - Al Capones whiteclad assassin in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables (1987). I've always found Dragos portrayal of Nitti to be very icy (and I mean that in a good way), and that is probably why I was almost annoyed when I found him to be so terrible (NOT in a good way) in this one. His acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting. When his character is supposed to react to the awful things Komomo has been subjected to I was sitting in the sofa, twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by Drago. I'm grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute. The finale is probably supposed to be chocking, maybe even revolting and horrid, but I just found it to be kind of...you know... \\"blah\\" (and I looked at my watch again, for the umptieth time, just wishing the crappy episode would end). Maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit, but that's only because I couldn't help thinking of an episode of Red Dwarf, and the upside-down chins of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens... Lucky you, if you've seen that episode and now decide to see Imprint, I will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you. My first thought, when Imprint finally ended, was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it, was hearing the main title theme by Edward Shearmur (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series), and that - if anything - is a big friggin warning, don't you think? One might point to the costume design, by Michiko Kitamura, and say that there, at least, is something NOT lacking in style and refinement...but there are so many other films and TV-shows that is so much better at showing off the Japanese \\"geisha-fashion\\". This is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed. Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror-episode is boring, uninspiring and pointless. In other words; It's really, really BAD!

Movie title: Welcome to the Dollhouse Movie plot: Twelve-year-old Dawn Wiener is a shy, unattractive, unpopular seventh grader living in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey. Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. Instead of forcing himself upon her, Brandon starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her. Meanwhile, Mark's band is joined by Steve Rodgers, a charismatic and handsome aspiring teenage rock musician who agrees to play in the band in exchange for Mark's help in school. Dawn decides to pursue him romantically... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse,\\" Steve Rodgers, a charismatic and handsome aspiring teenage rock musician, joins Mark's band.

Today, three months later, not so much.  Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag.  Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy.  There is another local restaurant that does this for me.  Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless.  I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy.  So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous.  The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush.  The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough.  However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices.  Everything was freshly made that has to be said.  The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the \\"sambar?\\"when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food)   It was lentils in a tomato base.  Really good.   The waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady.   I am so disappointed in the food this time around though.  I know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time.  The bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff.  Here today, gone tomorrow.  Today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us.  I don't think I would make another trip out to 24th Avenue and Bell to eat this indian food.  I thought I had found a gem, but sadly this is not the case.  Management:  Work on your food... who was cooking in December that made my first visit so great???","output":"The review can be considered negative overall. The reviewer starts by mentioning that they were impressed by the food on their previous visit in December. However, in their recent experience, the quality of the dishes they had, such as the chicken biryani and shrimp sag, were not as good as before. They mention that the shrimp sag was flavorless and the basmati rice tasted like white mush. While they acknowledge that the food appeared to be fresh and that they received a small sample from the buffet, they clearly express their disappointment in the overall meal. They also had a positive experience with the waitress, who was described as polite, attentive, and friendly. However, this positive experience with the staff does not seem to outweigh their dissatisfaction with the food.  The reviewer suggests that the inconsistency in food quality might be due to the movement of chefs and staff in the restaurant business, and they miss the former chef who prepared their meals during their first visit. They end the review with a message to management, urging them to work on improving the food quality. So, despite some positive elements (such as friendly service and a good experience from the previous visit), the review primarily reflects the disappointment and negative experience the reviewer had during their recent visit, which is why it can be considered negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Support for abortion rights has fallen sharply in the past year, with Americans now split roughly 50-50 between those who back legal access to abortion and those who oppose it, according to a new survey. Anti-abortion activists demonstrate on Capitol Hill in Washington in September. The findings mark a dramatic shift in public opinion, supporters of abortion rights have outnumbered opponents for many years, with one brief exception, studies have shown. But only 47 percent of Americans now feel abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a drop from 54 percent a year ago, according to the poll. Meanwhile, 45 percent say it should be illegal in all or most cases. That's up from 41 percent a year ago. Given the survey's margin of error, the two camps are statistically tied. \\"These data suggest that a number of people have changed their minds in the past year,\\" said Gregory Smith of the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, one of the survey's authors. It's not only one type of person or group whose opinion has changed, he said. \\"There was a drop seen in many, many demographics: men and women, people with a college degree and those with less education, people with various religious backgrounds,\\" he said. The only groups whose opinions on abortion did not change were African-Americans -- who tend to oppose it -- and young people and those not affiliated with any particular religion, who tend to say it should be legal, he said. \\"Beyond that, this movement [was] across the board,\\" he said. Anti-abortion activists welcomed the findings. \\"This is great news. This poll shows that the pro-life movement is winning hearts and minds. Pro-lifers are making an effective case that all women deserve better than abortion and that every child deserves a chance to be born,\\" said Cathy Ruse, the senior fellow for legal studies at the anti-abortion Family Research Council in Washington. The Rev. Flip Benham, a Dallas, Texas-based anti-abortion activist, said the survey reflected a change he had already seen taking place. \\"It's something that we have known for a long, long time that's been beneath the radar,\\" he said. \\"The heart of America is changing and only with time do the laws reflect that change.\\" \\"When the church will come out into the streets, we win the battle,\\" said Benham, director of operations for Operation Save America. \\"We have to return to the God of our founding fathers and our pilgrim fathers,\\" he said. But Terry O'Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, firmly rejects religious opposition to abortion. \\"Abortion is a blessing when it is chosen freely by a woman who needs it. It is a blessing,\\" she said, citing the Rev. Katherine Ragsdale, dean of the Episcopal Divinity School. O'Neill has been in that position herself, she said. \\"When I was in my early 20s, I thought I needed an abortion. I was escaping a very violent marriage that lasted about eight months,\\" she said. \\"The young man I was married to exploded and severely battered me.\\" She fled to her parents' home. A month later, she began to suspect she was pregnant with her abusive husband's child. \\"If I had had a baby, I would have been tied to that man for the rest of my life,\\" she said. \\"I didn't need the abortion, as it turned out, but if I had needed that abortion, it would have been a blessing. \\"I knew I was going to become a mother, but not with that man, not with that pregnancy,\\" she said. She said it was important to distinguish between people who oppose abortion and those who want it to be against the law. \\"I do realize that a lot of people in this country consider themselves to be pro-life,\\" she said. \\"They also don't want it to be a crime for a woman to get an abortion.\\" Smith, the researcher, suspects the election of President Obama, a pro-choice Democrat, may be one cause of the shift in public opinion. \\"Look at the timing,\\" he said. \\"Through October of last year, the findings were consistent, with supporters outnumbering opponents,\\" he said. Pew first noticed the change in public opinion in a survey in April, and did a larger study in August to confirm it. Opponents of abortion feel more strongly about it than supporters of legal access, he said. \\"Some people, particularly on the right, have become more entrenched, more certain of their own positions on abortion,\\" he said. \\"Conservative Republicans are more certain about the correctness of their own position and less likely to say they want to see compromise. They are concerned that Obama will go too far in supporting abortion rights as president,\\" he said. \\"On the left you see some relaxing of views.\\" But the survey also found that the number of people who felt passionately about abortion is falling. About four out of 10 people in the survey could not define Obama's position on abortion. \\"That is an indicator that although opinions have moved, this issue right now is not at the top of the political debate,\\" Smith said. But the subject has crept into the battle to reform America's health care system, with opponents of abortion in both parties determined to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions. Under the Hyde amendment, federal money currently can be used to pay for abortions only in case of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. There have been at least two abortion-related slayings in the United States this year, one on each side of the debate. George Tiller, a doctor known for performing abortions, was killed in May. Tiller was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. Scott Roeder, a 51-year-old anti-abortion activist, is charged in Tiller's killing. He has pleaded not guilty. Anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon, 63, was shot dead outside a school in Owosso, Michigan, on September 11. He was associated with Benham's Operation Save America. Harlan James Drake, 33, is accused of shooting him and another man in separate locations that day. Authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon; only that he was offended by anti-abortion material that Pouillon had displayed across from the school all week, according to Sara Edwards of the Shiawassee County prosecutor's office. The Supreme Court, the country's main legal battleground on abortion, has ruled only once on the hot-button subject since 1992, in a close 2007 decision that upheld federal restrictions on a controversial late-term abortion procedure called \\"partial birth abortion\\" by its opponents. Judge Sonia Sotomayor, then a federal appeals court judge, deflected questions about abortion this summer when she faced Senate confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court. She was confirmed. The court has not announced any abortion-related cases on its 2009-2010 docket. The 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade effectively legalized abortion in the United States. In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were performed, down from 1.31 million in 2000, according to data compiled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which aims to \\"advance sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research, policy analysis and education.\\" About 2 percent of American women age 15-44 had an abortion in 2005, the latest year for which the institute has information. The rate has been falling gradually since 1981, when it peaked at just under 3 percent, institute figures show. The new findings come from a telephone survey of more than 4,000 adults in August 2009, conducted by the Washington-based Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and the Pew Research Center for The People & The Press. CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.

Write some highlights for the following article: Manned by a pair of trained officers, a large private security jeep moves slowly past the high walls lining a residential street in the suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa. Heavily armed and alert, the officers scan the designated area, looking for any suspicious activity. They work for CSS Tactical, a private security company hired by local residents to patrol their area and protect them from any potential criminals. \\"To be proactive, we need to be noticed,\\" says Ricky Croock, managing director of CSS Tactical. \\"We need people to say 'hold on, there is a dedicated tactical vehicle.' \\"A tactical vehicle is a bigger vehicle -- it is more aggressive, it's a deterrent. So the first point is we want to deter as opposed to catch crime.\\" The security officers are well armed. They carry semi-automatic weapons and hand guns and they're trained in how and when to use them. And while only the police have the power of random stop and search in public places, security companies also stop people they regard as suspicious. From April 2011 to March 2012 there were 15,609 murders in South Africa, as well as 64,514 sexual offenses and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery. According to the country's latest \\"Victims of crime survey,\\" 57% of respondents felt that housebreaking/burglary was the crime most feared in their area of residence. In recent years, South Africa has stepped up efforts to tackle crime, one of the country's worst social ills. Last September, the South African Police Service said that serious crime in the country had been reduced by 31.8% from 2004/5 to 2011/12. But 2011 to 2012 saw a reduction in serious crime of just 1.9%. \\"We only have the official crime statistics to go by,\\" says Rudolph Zinn of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. \\"If you look at what the police would report annually in September of every year, we see over the last three or four years that crime has leveled off. \\"The more concerning factor is the high percentage of so-called violent or contact crime, which is about a third of all the crime reported to the South African Police Service.\\" And that's what has fueled the boom in the country's private security industry, crime experts say. There are nearly 9,000 companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards. That's more than the police and army combined, according to South African officials. \\"The security industry is bigger than what it has ever been in South Africa,\\" says Zinn. \\"I think the growth in the industry is definitely attributed to the fact that, let's call it a weak policing or ineffective policing, and it created the opportunity for private individuals to move into the market.\\" Some of those individuals have a military background. Waal de Waal, chief operating officer at South African-owned Protea Coin, spent 18 years in the special forces and military intelligence before joining the private security sector a decade ago. He is today one of the 17,000 people employed by Protea Coin. Part of the multi-million dollar company's work is dealing with small-scale crime, like recovering fuel stolen from a petrol station. The company, which also provides security at many of South Africa's mines and has been kept busy by the recent strikes in the sector, offers a range of services, including 24-hour property monitoring and protection against organized criminal syndicates. \\"The role of private security companies is distinctively different to that of the police,\\" says Petrus Van Niekerk, the chief executive of Protea Coin. \\"We view our role as private security to really aid and support the police.\\" But what happens when private security companies take matters into their own hands? The South African government claims that it's an industry that threatens national security and is determined to tighten its regulation. \\"A very dangerous situation arises if you have a security industry that outstrips both your police and your army and there is completely no regulation of that industry,\\" says Jenni Irish-Qhobosheane, the head of the Civilian Secretariat for Police. \\"I think the public can find themselves in situations where, basically, they are put at the mercy of private security companies who are unprofessional,\\" she adds. One measure considered by the country's government is that private security firms must be owned by South Africans. \\"This type of move is going to frighten away foreign direct investment and I think that is a danger,\\" says Hanes Venter, sales director at the South African arm of G4S, a London-listed global security giant. \\"Foreign direct investment is already down year on year but this is a worry from that perspective for me.\\" Whatever regulations the South African government eventually introduces, it seems unlikely the demand for private securities companies will diminish amid high unemployment rates, as well as widespread poverty and simmering industrial tensions.","output":"A growing private security industry in South Africa has emerged due to high rates of violent crimes and perceived inefficiency of local police. CSS Tactical, a private security company, is one example of a firm now hired by Johannesburg residents to patrol their neighborhoods as they aim to deter crime. Recent statistics showed that in 2011 to 2012, South Africa experienced 15,609 murders, 64,514 sexual offenses, and 101,203 cases of aggravated robbery.

This number is larger than the combined number of the police and army, according to South African officials. The government claims that this expanding industry presents a threat to national security and intends to tighten its regulation.

Robert has a clear view of his future, but Hunter is still trying and that is because  Choose your answer from: [i] Robert has a confuse mind. [ii] Hunter has a confuse mind.","output":"Hunter has a confuse mind. While Robert had a clearly defined vision of his future, Hunter was still struggling, unsure of which path to follow. Many factors contributed to Hunter's confusion, and he often found himself pondering over countless questions, trying to navigate the uncertain waters of his aspirations and desires. Hunter's indecision stemmed from a multitude of reasons. Growing up, he had always been passionate about various fields; from music and art to science and technology. His interests were broad, and he found great delight in exploring different subjects. This made it difficult for him to settle on one career path that would bring him the highest sense of fulfillment and happiness. In contrast, Robert had found his calling early in life. Encouraged by his parents, he had taken up engineering, and he had excelled in both his academic and professional pursuits. With each achievement, Robert's conviction in his chosen path grew stronger, fueling his ambitions and providing him with a clear direction for his future. Hunter, on the other hand, was petrified of making the wrong decision. The thought of committing to a job that he might eventually dislike haunted him. He feared that investing his time and energy into the wrong profession would result in a lifetime of regret and dissatisfaction. The pressure of making the right choice became so overwhelming that it paralyzed him from making any decision at all. Additionally, the people around Hunter further complicated his decision-making process. His loved ones all had their own opinions on what direction he should take, and their advice often contradicted each other. His father, a successful businessman, urged Hunter to pursue a career in finance, emphasizing the importance of financial stability. His mother, on the other hand, wanted him to follow his artistic dreams, as she herself had given up a promising career in painting to start a family. Amidst this cacophony of opinions, Hunter struggled to find his own voice. He spent hours upon hours researching possible careers, talking to professionals, and attending various workshops, attempting to uncover that one profession that would ignite a spark within him. Yet, the more he researched, the more confused he became, as he discovered a multitude of careers he had not previously considered, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Time was not on Hunter's side. As his friends began embarking on their career paths, attending prestigious universities or joining the workforce, the pressure to make a decision mounted exponentially. Hunter felt like he was being left behind, with no direction or purpose. It was during one of these moments of anguish that Hunter had a realization. He decided that he would not allow his fear of choosing the wrong path to prevent him from pursuing a fulfilling life. He understood that he might need to try out several careers before he could find the one that truly resonated with him. And with this newfound determination, he set out to explore his options, embracing the unknown with open arms. Hunter began by experimenting in different fields, starting with internships and part-time jobs. He tried his hand at graphic design, software development, marketing, and even spent some time working in his father's business. With each experience, he gained valuable insight into the inner workings of these professions, as well as an understanding of what aspects were appealing and which were off-putting. In the years that followed, Hunter continued to explore his interests, learning from both his successes and failures. As he delved into each field, he slowly started to develop a better understanding of himself and his passions. Unbeknownst to him, as Hunter persevered through his tumultuous journey, he had grown into a more self-assured, confident individual. Hunter's story serves as a reminder that clarity and certainty in one's future might not always be readily apparent. For some, it takes a journey through the twists and turns of life, learning and growing along the way, to truly discover their purpose and direction. So, although Hunter's path might have been vastly different from that of his friend Robert, it was through this state of confusion and exploration that he eventually found his calling and achieved a sense of fulfillment in life."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Classify the given tweet into the three categories: (1) 'Hate Speech', (2) 'Offensive' and (3) 'Neither'.

(CNN) -- BP reported problems controlling the undersea well at the heart of the largest oil spill in U.S. history and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in March, according to documents released Sunday.  \\"We are in the midst of a well control situation on MC 252 #001 and have stuck pipe. We are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe, plugback the well and bypass,\\" Scherie Douglas, a BP regulatory advisor, told the district engineer for the U.S. Interior Department's Minerals Management Service in a March 10 e-mail.  In a follow-up e-mail to the district engineer, Frank Patton, Douglas reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer, the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency.  \\"With the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing BOPs,\\" she wrote.  When Patton told BP he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control, the company won a postponement from David Trocquet, the MMS district manager in New Orleans, Louisiana, the documents show. Trocquet ordered BP to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement, according to his reply. The messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed.  The exchange was among the documents released Sunday by leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern Gulf of Mexico.

For example, you might write, \\"In 1984, Orwell's use of imagery to establish a bleak and dreary world is key to bringing home his theme that totalitarianism is something to be avoided at all costs.\\" How you organize your essay is up to you. One typical method is to go through the book in order, providing your evidence starting at the beginning of the book and moving towards the end.  Alternatively, it may make sense to you to begin with a historical introduction to the work to provide context. Another method is to present your most important part of the argument first and work down from there. Write down a Roman numeral for each main idea you want to cover in your essay, as well as your introduction and conclusion. Next to the Roman numeral, jot down that main idea in a shortened form. For instance, you might write:  I. Introduction II. Provide background information and historical context for 1984  III. Introduce the author's main theme IV. Establish how imagery helps create the theme V. Conclusion Under each Roman numeral, use letters and then Arabic numerals to go into more detail about what you want to cover in each section. You can be very specific or just cover the basics. However, the more specific you are, the easier it will be to write your essay. Your detailed outline might look something like this:  I.

While it may not be the most accurate depiction of drug addiction, the film features some standout performances, particularly from Robert Downey Jr. and James Spader.

Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, \\"We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top.\\" On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: \\"Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung\\".In July 1991, Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment.

He has a lovely wife, Grace Horn (Rosanna Arquette), who is pregnant, and a beautiful son of about five years old. Sammy indeed loves his family, but like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, he has a double life, having sex with many different women. Dr. Jane Bordeaux (Nastassja Kinski) is trying to help him. OK, it is my fault: I read the summary of the other IMDB user comments, I saw the IMDB user rating, but I really did not believe that Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski could participate in such a bad movie. I decided to check it, and actually some comments are very complacent. The storyline, the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some X-rated movies we can find more intelligent stories. The photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a VHS camcorder. Michael Des Barres does not have sense of ridiculous: being an old man, bald, would be acceptable in an advertisement of Viagra or grandfather of the small boy. But as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman, it is scary. In Wood Allen's comedy, maybe he got a chance, but in a \`serious' movie, it is funny. I am trying to figure out why or how Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski accepted to participate in such awful, amateurish and trash movie. Do they need money? Lack of chances in better movies due to their ages? Are they friends of the \`director' (sorry for using this word) and decided to help and promote him? I do not know whether the intention of Rosanna Arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone, but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script. The same is applicable to the gorgeous Nastassja Kinki. She is presented fat, without make-up, without any glamour. A total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history. A fact is really intriguing me: how can a reader, without any personal interest, promote this trash, giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie? Are they friends of the \`director' (again, I am using this word...) or the cast? It sounds very strange to me that a normal IMDB reader can like such a film. My vote is two.

While there is some international commonality in the way political parties are recognized, and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and some are significant. Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first founded. In democracies, political parties are elected by the electorate to run a government. Many countries have numerous powerful political parties, such as Germany and India and some nations have one-party systems, such as China. The United States is a two-party system, with its two most powerful parties being the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did China have when its government was first founded?","output":"China, as one of the world's oldest civilizations, has a long and complex history spanning several millennia. Therefore, it is essential to first clarify which \\"founding\\" of the Chinese government we are referring to. For the purpose of this answer, I will focus on the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, as it marked the beginning of the modern Chinese government system we know today. At its founding in 1949, China was led by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which had just emerged victorious in a long civil war against the Nationalist Party known as the Kuomintang (KMT). The Chinese Civil War resulted in major socio-economic and political changes within China. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party, proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, marking the beginning of a one-party socialist state led by the Communist Party. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the country's political and economic systems were fundamentally transformed. The new government sought to centralize authority, eliminate opposition, and create a planned economy. The CPC emphasized social and economic egalitarianism, and Marxist-Leninist principles became the guiding ideology. China began to pursue policies to reduce poverty, achieve economic self-sufficiency, and build a modern industrial system. In the following years, the Chinese government implemented various policies that led to significant social and political upheavals, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Both of these movements sought to advance the country's development and solidify the Communist Party's rule, but they also resulted in immense human and economic costs. In the late 1970s, the Chinese leadership, under Deng Xiaoping, initiated a series of market-oriented reforms that gradually liberalized the economy. These changes spurred rapid economic growth, transforming China into a global economic superpower. However, the political system remained a one-party socialist state under the control of the Communist Party. In conclusion, when the modern Chinese government was first founded in 1949 under the leadership of the Communist Party, it established a one-party socialist state, guided by Marxist-Leninist principles. This system has evolved over time, with significant economic liberalization beginning in the late 20th century, but the political structure remains centered on the Communist Party's control."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

CONTEXT: El sexo de los híbridos: la Ley de Haldane  La ley de Haldane establece que cuando uno de los dos sexos está ausente en los híbridos interespecíficos entre dos especies determinadas, el sexo que no se obtiene, es raro o estéril, es el sexo heterogamético.  Por lo menos en mamíferos hay cada vez mayor evidencia que indica que esto se debe a las altas tasas de mutación de los genes determinantes de masculinidad en el cromosoma Y. Se ha sugerido que la regla de Haldane simplemente obedece a que el sexo masculino es más sensible que el femenino cuando los genes determinantes del sexo están incluidos en un genoma híbrido. Pero también hay organismos en los que el sexo heterogamético es la hembra (aves, mariposas) y la regla sigue vigente en ellos. Luego no es un problema relacionado con el desarrollo sexual ni con los cromosomas sexuales. Haldane propuso que la estabilidad de desarrollo del individuo híbrido precisa de un complemento génico completo de cada especie parental, por lo que el híbrido del sexo heterogamético estaría desequilibrado (le falta al menos un cromosoma de una de las dos especies parentales). Por ejemplo, el macho híbrido obtenido al cruzar hembras de D. melanogaster con machos de D. simulans, que es inviable, carece del cromosoma X de D. simulans.

This label of glamorous indicates that the hotel must be a stunning and attractive place, likely featuring elegant design and an upscale atmosphere. Furthermore, the statement mentions the hotel's adherence to a formal ambience, exemplified by the requirement of a jacket and tie. This emphasis on formality suggests that the hotel wishes to maintain a specific level of decorum and sophistication in the environment and experiences it offers its guests. The dress code serves as a standard that ensures guests not only look the part but also contribute to and respect the overall atmosphere of the establishment. Therefore, based on the international glamour and formal ambience of The turn-of-the-century hotel, it is accurate to conclude that \\"The hotel is glamorous and formal.\\" The hotel's commitment to maintaining a high standard of elegance and sophistication by adhering to a more traditional dress code and upholding an atmosphere of formality and allure sets it apart as a luxurious destination that expects the same caliber of behavior from its guests. Such an environment would likely appeal to those seeking a refined and lavish experience during their stay, and the hotel's reputation would continue to attract patrons who appreciate and revel in this level of opulence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The algorithm-based analytics software generates reputation reports based on social and traditional media material. However some experts say such tools are often inadequate because of the nuance of language. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said she should not comment at this time. Spotter's UK sales director Richard May said the company monitored material that was \\"publicly available\\". Its proprietary software uses a combination of linguistics, semantics and heuristics to create algorithms that generate reports about online reputation.

Algorithms had been developed to reflect various tones in 29 different languages including Chinese, Russian and Arabic, said Mr May. \\"Nothing is fool-proof - we are talking about automated systems,\\" he told the BBC. \\"But five years ago you couldn't get this level of accuracy - we were at the 50% mark.\\" Mr May added one of the most common subjects for sarcasm was bad service - such as delayed journeys. \\"One of our clients is Air France.

Article: Go for jeans or pants in a straight cut for universally flattering length, whether you opt for a sexy form-fitting skinny style or a bootcut that floats straight away from the legs to the floor.  Choose a dark wash on jeans when you want to slim any area of your legs or hips. Alternatively, you may want to add lighter wash or bright color to accentuate the legs and lend balance to a larger torso. Avoid fading and whiskering on denim, or too many embellishments on pockets and seams, in areas you do not want to widen. Find skirts and dresses that fall just above the knee for the most universally flattering look for the legs.  Also try out a high-low hemline, which is shorter in the front and longer in the back, to get some more coverage while still showing off your legs for an alluring look. Look out for skirts and dresses that feature pleating or lines that fall vertically from the waist to make the lower body look longer. Try tights as a way to show off your legs while not actually showing bare skin if it makes you uncomfortable to do so, as well as provide sexy length to the leg.  Choose tights in a similar hue as your skirt, dress, or shoes to help create the illusion of extra length in the legs. Try out tights with classic sex appeal like fishnets, lace, or thigh-highs.

Write highlights for this article: Death rates in NHS hospitals are among the highest in the western world, shock figures revealed yesterday. British patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in America. They have five times the chance of dying from pneumonia and twice the chance of being killed by blood poisoning. Experts say that, despite recent improvements, NHS death rates still outstrip those in many other European countries. British patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in America. Pictured is a tribute wall  in memory of patients who have died at Stafford Hospital. Figures obtained by Professor Brian Jarman, in an exclusive report for Channel 4 News, show that the death rates in English hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in America. Sir Brian, a globally-recognised expert on hospital performance, also calculated that in 2004 death rates for hospitals in England were 22.5 per cent higher than in six  others in the western world including Canada and France. The latest figures are not yet available although Professor  Jarman suspects death rates in England have fallen because care has substantially improved. ‘What I found was that the adjusted death rate in England was about 22 per cent higher than for the average of all the seven countries that I looked at and it was about 58 per cent higher than the best of the countries,’ he said. An investigation was launched following concerns about high death rates and poor care at the hospital run by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. ‘I expected us to do well and was very surprised we didn’t do well – but there is no means of denying the results as they are absolutely clear.’ ‘We should take notice of it and say there is a problem in the provision of health care in England.’ Earlier this year a report warned that hundreds of patients had died needlessly due to poor care at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust. But this was not an isolated case and a subsequent review led by the Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS, found that thousands of patients had died unnecessarily at 14 other trusts through neglect. Ministers have since put 11 of these trusts into special measures  including North Cumbria, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Tameside and Basildon and Thurrock. Hit squads have been sent in to make urgent improvements. Yesterday Sir Bruce said he would be holding urgent discussions with other officials about the data.‘I want our NHS to be based on evidence. I don’t want to disregard stuff that might be inconvenient or embarrassing,’ he said. ‘I want to use this kind of data to help inform how we can improve our NHS. ‘So what we need to do as clinical professionals in our NHS is concentrate on how we can improve that and I will be the first to bring this data to the attention of clinical leaders in this country to see how we can tackle this problem. ‘The fact is we have a health service that is admired around the world, founded on the cradle to grave principle. But the other fact is we still have too many patients dying in our hospitals when their relatives were expecting them to come home.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘This Government has shone an unprecedented spotlight on poor care through the Keogh review of 14 hospitals with persistently high rates, and taken tough action to tackle these problems by placing 11 hospitals in special measures. ‘Sadly, warnings about high death rates were ignored too frequently in the past. ‘Following the horrors of Mid Staffordshire, we have established a new rigorous inspection regime led by the Chief Inspector of Hospitals. ‘He will look at mortality data as well as issues of leadership and culture, and we will act quickly where problems are uncovered.’ Figures show that the death rates in English hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in America. File picture. Sir Brian pioneered the use of hospital standardised mortality ratios (HSMRs) as a way of measuring whether death rates are higher or lower than expected. They are adjusted for factors such as age and the severity of the patient’s illness. It was by using HSMRs that Professor Jarman was able to identify the high mortality rates at the Mid Staffs trust. He said one of the reasons that American hospitals do much better is because staff are actively encouraged to report mistakes – and whistleblowers are not persecuted as they sometimes are in the NHS. He said: ‘If you go to the States doctors can talk about problems, nurses can raise problems and listen to patient complaints. Hospitals were urged yesterday to ensure consultants work seven days a week. The Royal College of Physicians, which issued the call, also wants specialist doctors to travel to see elderly patients on wards. A patient with several illnesses such as angina, diabetes and dementia often has to travel to clinics dotted around their hospital. The Royal College also wants a chief of medicine to be appointed in every hospital to oversee the care of the elderly.","output":"Recent figures reveal that death rates in NHS hospitals are amongst the highest in the western world.

And since this is equal to the big gift of 6864 marbles, we can say: 624 * y = 6864 Now, let's find out how many toy cars (y) you have by dividing the big gift (6864 marbles) by the number of marbles for each toy car (624 marbles): y = 6864 marbles / 624 marbles = 11 So, you have 11 toy cars (y) in this situation.

April 25, 1939 saw the introduction by Bob Kane of what major comic book character, one of the most popular of all times, in issue #37 of Detective Comics?","output":"On April 25, 1939, the world of comic books witnessed the introduction of one of its most iconic and enduring characters, Batman, created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. This enigmatic superhero made his debut in issue #37 of Detective Comics, which eventually led to him becoming a household name and a widely beloved character with an immeasurable impact on popular culture. Batman, also known as the Dark Knight or the Caped Crusader, is the secret alter ego of billionaire playboy and philanthropist Bruce Wayne. The character was born out of tragedy, as young Bruce witnesses the brutal murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, in a mugging gone wrong in the crime-ridden city of Gotham. This traumatic event instills in him a deep-seated desire to fight crime, protect the innocent, and avenge his parents' deaths. To embody the fearsome persona of Batman, Bruce Wayne trains himself both physically and mentally, acquiring an unparalleled set of skills. He masters numerous martial arts, stealth techniques, detective work, and criminology in his quest for justice. Uniquely, Batman has no superhuman powers but relies on his honed abilities, intellect, and an array of gadgets and vehicles to help him in his crime-fighting endeavors. Batman's suit, one of the character's defining attributes, is an intimidating costume based on the image of a bat, symbolizing Bruce's childhood fear of the nocturnal creature. The cape, cowl, and bat emblem give Batman a fearsome, and theatrical appearance, granting him the psychological edge over his enemies and making him a legend in the eyes of Gotham's populace. The Batman universe is marked by a vast array of memorable villains – from the maniacal Joker to the cunning Catwoman, the vengeful Mr. Freeze, the enigmatic Riddler, and the sadistic Bane, to name a few. Batman's endless struggle against these adversaries has led him to develop a relationship with Gotham's police force, particularly Commissioner James Gordon, who often relies on the vigilante's assistance in solving crimes and combating larger threats. Throughout the years, the Batman character has been adapted into numerous mediums, such as television shows, animated series, and blockbuster films, with various actors donning the iconic cape and cowl. Additionally, the character has inspired a long list of sidekicks and allies, most notably Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing, who have played essential roles in the Bat-family dynamic. In conclusion, Batman's debut on April 25, 1939, in issue #37 of Detective Comics, marked the beginning of an enduring legacy that continues to captivate audiences around the world. As one of the most popular comic book characters of all time, Batman's perseverance in the face of adversity, dedication to justice, and unwavering selflessness resonate with fans and make him an enduring symbol of hope and heroism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - good book - bus stop - post office - triangle - graph  The rationale to choose \\"post office\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The choice \\"post office\\" is the most appropriate answer for this question considering the context and the requirements of the given situation. In this case, the question asks where one would stand in a line and not need a coat when it is cold outside. We can analyze each option and rationalize why \\"post office\\" is the best answer. 1. Good book: A good book is not a location, but an item which does not offer any form of shelter or protection from the cold weather. You cannot stand \\"in\\" a book, so this option does not fit the context of the question. 2. Bus stop: Although waiting at a bus stop may provide some temporary respite from the cold, one would still need a coat as bus stops are typically outdoors and exposed to the elements. Additionally, lines at bus stops may require individuals to stand outside the sheltered area, further increasing the need for adequate clothing to protect against the cold. 3. Post office: The post office is an indoor location with climate control, which means that one would not need a coat while standing in line inside the building. In a post office, individuals would generally be waiting for services such as mailing or collecting packages, making it a logical place to stand in line out of the cold. The controlled indoor environment protects patrons from extreme temperatures, making it possible to stand in line without a coat even during cold weather. Hence, choosing the post office as the answer is the most suitable option given the circumstances. 4. Triangle: Just like the \\"good book\\", a triangle is not a location where one could stand in line, but rather a geometric shape. It does not have any relevance to the context of the question, as it offers no shelter or protection from the cold weather. 5. Graph: A graph is also not a location and is an abstract concept or visualization used to represent data or relationships between variables. \\"Graph\\" has no bearing on the context of the question since it cannot provide any form of shelter or relief from the cold. In conclusion, based on the specific details and context of the question, the most reasonable answer to \\"Where would you stand in a line and not need a coat if it is cold outside?\\" would be the \\"post office.\\" This choice accurately meets the requirements of the given situation as an appropriate place to stand in line without needing a coat during cold weather, while the other options lack the necessary relevance or context to do so."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Can you be too beautiful? It is hardly a problem that most of us have to bother -- as much as we might like to dream that it were the case. Yet the blessings and curses of beauty have been a long-standing interest in psychology. Do those blessed with shiny faces and an attractive body live in a cloud of appreciation -- or does it sometimes pay to be ordinary? Combing through decades of findings, social psychologists Lisa Slattery Walker and Tonya Frevert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte havereviewed all the evidence to dateand their conclusions are not what you might expect. At the most basic level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo  around it; we see that someone has one good quality, and by association, our deep mind may assume that they have other good ones too. Even in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive criminals are likely to get less strict sentences, or to escape punishment entirely; attractive plaintiffs , meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. \\"It's an effect seen everywhere,\\" says Walker. But if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can have opposite results. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, hidden sexist prejudices  can work against attractive women, making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs that require power. And as you might expect, good-looking people of both sexes run into envy -- one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to employ you if they judge that you are more attractive than they are. More worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people. And the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One...

Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other (heavier gases diffuse more slowly). A complete theoretical explanation of Graham's law was provided years later by the kinetic theory of gases.

(AP) — Rapper Snoop Dogg says he wants to create a music festival in his father's hometown so he can perform in Mississippi.      \\"We always stop in New Orleans but we never book a show here. We might as well do it ourselves because my booking agent just won't do it,\\" he said during a weekend stop in Magnolia, a south Mississippi city of about 2,400 near the Louisiana state line.      The rapper born Calvin Broadus stopped in Magnolia on his way to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, where he performed Saturday, to discuss his plans for \\"Snoop Fest\\" with the mayor, the McComb Enterprise-Journal reported Monday (http://bit.ly/2pe7x3T ).      \\"We want to try to get it done this year, but if not, we will definitely do it next year,\\" Mayor Anthony Witherspoon said.      He said Magnolia is a great venue because it's 90 minutes from Jackson, Hattiesburg, Baton Rouge and New Orleans.      It's about 17 miles (27.4 kilometers) north of the Louisiana state line and just a few more from Britney Spears' hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana.      Snoop Dogg said the festival's first day would feature blues, gospel and country acts for the \\"aunts, grandmas and uncles,\\" with hip-hop and rhythm and blues on the second day. He would close the festival.      \\"I think the first should have what the heritage of Mississippi is about and then the second day should be about the generation that took it to another level,\\" he said.      Snoop said he wants to bring back Mississippi natives Brandy and Ray J Norwood of McComb, David Banner of Jackson, Souljia Boy of Batesville and newcomer La'Porsha Renae, also of McComb, and to give a shot to some performers who are still local.      \\"We can give the top five hottest artists a chance to open up,\\" he said.      The rapper said he wants to do something that reaches out to everyone. He said he comes to Mississippi three or four times a year, but only his family sees him.      \\"I want to do something so that everyone will get to see me,\\" he said. \\"If I wanted to do a show and leave, I could've done that.

Refused (also known as The Refused) is a Swedish punk rock band originating from Umea and formed in 1991. Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxzen, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandstrom, and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist Jon Brannstrom was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature. Refused started as a \\"fresh-faced positive hardcore band\\" and their music became increasingly progressive and radical, as did their lyrics. The record This Just Might Be the Truth was characterized for its \\"massive hardcore sound\\", mostly influenced by various bands from the New York hardcore scene (such as Earth Crisis). On its follow-up, Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent, the band had a heavier, more intricate style, which is generally attributed to their Slayer inspiration, and Lyxzen adopted screaming vocals rather than shouting. With the third album, The Shape of Punk to Come, \\"came the leap into the unknown\\" as the band mixed their previous style with unorthodox chord progressions, sampling, \\"ambient textures, jazz breakdowns\\", electronica and monologues, and other deviations from the hardcore punk music.  Refused's lyrics soon began to focus on far-left politics, drawing on anarchism, socialism, among others ideologies. By the time of their first album, the band already had a strong anti-establishment profile. The group's members were all vegan straight edge until their last show in 1998 and a couple of their songs dealt with these topics. Today, some of them no longer follow these lifestyles. In their live performances, vocalist Lyxzen usually delivers political speeches between songs. Before the Umea hardcore phenomenon went into full bloom, the band was seen as part of the scene centered around youth-oriented venue Galaxen, along with the punk-rock scene as well as metal bands such as Meshuggah.  Among the biggest influences of Refused were ManLiftingBanner, Born Against, Slayer, and Ian Svenonius's projects (The Make-Up, The Nation of Ulysses and Cupid Car Club). Other bands that have influenced them are Fugazi, Inside Out, and Snapcase.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister?, using the article: Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle.

Boz had ties to the mayor and a mayor's aide hovers over them during their investigation. After the crime scene investigation, he sees Beth Garner, an SFPD psychiatrist that Internal Affairs has required him to see. She asks him about his drug and alcohol use and he says he's been clean and sober for three months.The only lead the police have on Boz' murder is Catherine Tramell, a successful and extremely wealthy crime novelist who was the last person seen with Boz the night he died. Curran and fellow detective Gus Moran (George) look for Tramell at her Pacific Heights mansion, but they find only Roxy, Tramell's lesbian lover, is home. Roxy tells them Tramell is at her Stinson Beach beach house, and mentions that \\"she didn't do it, kill Johnny Boz\\". Curran and Moran go to the beach house to question Tramell and find her on a deckchair by the ocean. The two policemen introduce themselves, and Tramell says to Curran \\"I know who you are\\". They ask her questions about her relationship with Boz. She insists they weren't dating (\\"I wasn't dating him, I was fucking him\\").

Kevin had a much messier house than Joseph because","output":"Kevin was a bit of a disorganized person by nature, while Joseph was quite the opposite. There were several reasons that contributed to the stark difference in the tidiness of their homes. First and foremost, Kevin had a more demanding job with longer hours, which meant that he had less time and energy to devote to cleaning and organizing his living space. He would often come home exhausted from work, leaving him with little motivation to tidy up. In contrast, Joseph had a more flexible schedule and was able to allocate specific time slots for housekeeping tasks, ensuring that his home remained neat and orderly. Secondly, Kevin's personal interests and hobbies played a role in creating the clutter that dominated his home. He loved collecting various items, such as books, magazines, and memorabilia, but struggled to find appropriate storage solutions for his growing collection. This resulted in piles of clutter accumulating around his home, making it difficult for him to maintain a clean environment. On the other hand, Joseph had a more minimalist approach to his possessions, only keeping items that he truly valued and used regularly. This made it much easier for him to maintain a clutter-free home. Additionally, Kevin's lack of organization skills was exacerbated by his tendency to procrastinate on household chores. He would often put off cleaning tasks, convincing himself that he would tackle them later when he had more time or energy. Unfortunately, this frequently led to tasks piling up, and the clutter in his home worsened over time. Joseph, however, was more proactive with his cleaning habits, tending to chores promptly and consistently, which kept his living space in immaculate condition. Lastly, the difference in their social lives played a part in the state of their homes. Kevin enjoyed hosting gatherings and parties at his home, which often resulted in a substantial mess that required significant time and effort to clean up. Despite his best intentions to clean up promptly after these events, his aforementioned traits of exhaustion and procrastination often hindered him from doing so efficiently. Conversely, Joseph preferred smaller social gatherings and rarely hosted events in his home, thereby avoiding the potential chaos that came with larger parties. In conclusion, the disparity in the cleanliness of Kevin and Joseph's homes can be attributed to a combination of factors, including their work schedules, hobbies, organization skills, and social preferences. While Joseph's lifestyle lent itself to a naturally neater living space, Kevin battled against his disorganized nature and time limitations, resulting in a much messier home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does it follow that \\"The voice could not be heard.\\"?","output":"It appears you are referring to a situation where the secretary's voice, described as \\"terrified\\" and \\"quadrophonic,\\" is audible to someone, presumably within a narrative. The question, \\"Does it follow that 'The voice could not be heard.'?\\" seems to ask whether it is logical or appropriate to infer that the voice was inaudible. In this context, it is important to understand the meaning of the two phrases in question: 1. \\"The terrified, quadrophonic voice of the secretary could be heard again.\\" 2. \\"The voice could not be heard.\\" The first phrase suggests that the voice of the secretary, which exhibits a frightened tone and a surround sound-like quality, is audible. The use of \\"could be heard again\\" implies that this has happened at least once before, perhaps indicating a recurring theme or motif in the narrative. On the other hand, the second phrase implies that the voice is inaudible, meaning it cannot be heard by others. The presence of \\"could not\\" creates a clear sense of negation, negating the idea that the voice was discernible. Considering the meanings of the two phrases and their contrast, it does not logically follow that the second phrase would apply in this scenario. The initial statement establishes the audibility of the secretary's terrified and quadrophonic voice, while the second phrase asserts its inaudibility. These two concepts are mutually exclusive: if the voice can be heard, as the first statement implies, then it cannot simultaneously be inaudible, as the second statement suggests. Therefore, in response to your question, it does not follow that \\"The voice could not be heard.\\" Based on the given description of the situation, the secretary's voice is indeed audible, conveying a sense of terror and a unique quadrophonic quality.

Thinking he had not made himself understood or the Chinese student had not heard him clearly, he said, \\"Yes, indeed, you speak very well.\\" But the Chinese student sill kept saying \\"No.\\" In the end the American boy could not understand and didn't know what to say. What's wrong with the student's answer? He didn't accept a compliment in the same way as the American people do. He should answer \\"thank you\\" instead of \\"no\\". He really understood what the American boy had said, but he thought he should be modest .In the west, people will feel proud and confident when they are praised. So if someone says the dishes you have cooked are very delicious, you should say \\"Thank you\\". If someone says to a woman \\"You look so beautiful with the new clothes on.\\" She must be very happy and answer \\"Thank you\\". In our country we think being modest is a virtue and being proud is a bad thing, but in my opinion, being confident does not mean being proud, so  sometimes you should be confident instead of being modest. If you are modest and say, \\"No, I'm afraid I can't do it well\\" while working in a western country, the others may think that you really cannot do it. If you often say \\"No\\", you will certainly be looked down upon by others. If asking for a job, one says something like \\"Yes, I can certainly do it\\" instead of \\"Let me have a try\\", he or she will expect to get it. So in the west, you should be brave to show your self-confidence! Options: A Because he was expecting the Chinese student to say \\"Thank you\\". B Because he wouldn't like others to say \\"No\\". C Because he could hardly hear what the student had said. D Because he wondered whether the student could really speak good English. Answer: A Because he was expecting the Chinese student to say \\"Thank you\\". Question: A:","output":"Why was the American boy surprised by the Chinese student's response to his compliment? A) Because he was expecting the Chinese student to say \\"Thank you\\". B) Because he wouldn't like others to say \\"No\\". C) Because he could hardly hear what the student had said.

Please answer the following question: When did the newspaper, of which David Dinsmore is a former editor, become a tabloid ? Answer:","output":"David Dinsmore is a former editor of The Sun, a British newspaper that has gone through various transformations over the years. To answer the question precisely, we must first distinguish between the term \\"tabloid\\" in size and \\"tabloid\\" in content style. 1. Tabloid in size: The Sun newspaper adopted the tabloid size (a smaller, more compact format) on November 17, 1969. Prior to this date, the newspaper was published in a broadsheet format, which is larger and more traditional in appearance. The change was made to make the newspaper more portable and visually appealing, intending to reach a wider audience. 2. Tabloid in content style: The term \\"tabloid\\" is also often used to describe a more sensationalized and populist style of journalism. The Sun switched its editorial focus to this style in the early 1970s after Rupert Murdoch acquired and re-launched the newspaper in 1969. The paper started featuring more gossip, celebrity news, and sensationalist headlines. This change in editorial direction allowed The Sun to become one of the United Kingdom's best-selling newspapers. Now, coming to David Dinsmore, he was appointed as the editor of The Sun newspaper in June 2013 and held the position until September 2015. By the time Dinsmore became the editor, The Sun had already been operating as a tabloid in both size and content style for many years. Therefore, it is essential to note that the newspaper became a tabloid long before David Dinsmore became its editor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

Context: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it.

It then goes on to mention a song 'Siri Siri' and another song for a wind from spring (Vasanta Gaaliki Valapulu), indicating these are songs from the film.  Given these details, it is reasonable to deduce that the <MASK> token perhaps stands for the singer of these songs. Looking at the options, we can surmise that option A: Ghantasala, option C: B.Vasanth and option D: S.Janaki are well-known singers in the Telugu film industry. Option B: P.Leel appears slightly off context as there is no well-known Telugu singer associated with this name.  However, in this context, because the missing word immediately follows 'Siri siri', there is more probability that it refers to the singer of that particular song. The song 'Siri Siri' is famous and is sung by 'Ghantasala' in the Telugu film industry.  Hence using the context and the fame of the song 'Siri Siri', I would choose 'Ghantasala' as the most suitable word to fill in the <MASK> token.

In the premise, we learn that the director is in a meeting, replying while kicking his legs slightly with frustration. It is clear that the director is frustrated and expresses it by kicking his legs. However, the premise does not specify the number of times the director kicked his legs. The information provided is limited to the fact that the director kicked his legs \\"slightly\\" with frustration, but it doesn't provide any detail about the exact number of times this occurred. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the director kicked his legs twice with frustration. It is important to note that while the hypothesis is also suggesting that the director kicked his legs in frustration, it specifically mentions that the director did this action two times. Given these observations, we can now assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis concerning the provided choices: (A) Yes - This choice would imply that the premise directly supports the hypothesis, meaning that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis. However, as discussed earlier, the premise does not provide enough information to determine if the director kicked his legs specifically two times. (B) It is not possible to tell - This choice suggests that there is not enough information in the premise to conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not. Considering the analysis above, this option seems the most appropriate. The premise does not provide enough information to accurately determine if the director kicked his legs exactly two times out of frustration. (C) No - This choice would indicate that the premise does not support the hypothesis at all. However, this option does not seem accurate because the director's frustration and leg kicking behavior are mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis. The main issue lies in the fact that the premise does not specify the number of times the director kicked his legs. Therefore, based on the analysis, the most suitable answer seems to be option (B) - it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise. The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the director kicked his legs exactly two times with frustration, even though it does state that the director did kick his legs out of frustration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produce material that often is called wood are the palms. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and Cordyline. With all this material, the structure and composition of the structural material is quite different from ordinary wood.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The plant that is commonly mistaken for wood is bamboo. Bamboo, a member of the grass family, shares similar handling characteristics to ordinary dicot or conifer wood, which leads to this confusion. However, bamboo is distinct from traditional wood in its structure and composition. Bamboo is highly valued for its versatility, as it's used in various industries such as construction, where larger culms serve as building material, and in the manufacturing of engineered flooring, panels, and veneer. Another group of plants whose structural material is often called wood are the palms, although they hold lesser importance than bamboo. Other examples include Pandanus, Dracaena, and Cordyline, but these too play a smaller role in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Objective: How would I go about pinning down two pieces of aligned fabric? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options:  (A). Using clothes pins push it through both pieces of fabric away from you and then turn it towards you and then push it back through both pieces of fabric and repeat this until  you covered the outside of the fabric.;  (B). Using clothes pins push it through both pieces of fabric away from you and then turn it away from you and then push it back through both pieces of fabric and repeat this until  you covered the outside of the fabric.;","output":"To evaluate these options, let's consider the goals and steps involved in pinning two pieces of aligned fabric together and analyze the soundness of the options based on naive physics reasoning. Goals: 1. Keep the fabric pieces aligned. 2. Prevent the fabric from slipping or moving during sewing or handling. Steps to achieve goals: 1. Insert a clothespin through both layers of fabric. 2. Turn the clothespin to secure the fabric in place. 3. Repeat the process along the edges of the fabric. Now, let's analyze the given options. Option A: - Uses clothespins to attach the fabric. - Inserts the clothespin through both fabric layers away from you. - Turns the clothespin towards yourself, and then pushes it back through both fabric pieces. - Repeats the process around the fabric edges. Option B: - Uses clothespins to attach the fabric. - Inserts the clothespin through both fabric layers away from you. - Turns the clothespin away from yourself, and then pushes it back through both fabric pieces. - Repeats the process around the fabric edges. Based on the naive physics reasoning, such as how we understand how objects interact with each other, a sound approach would involve securely pinning the two fabrics together so they don't move or separate.  Both options A and B utilize clothespins and pin both layers of fabric repeatedly, which is aligned with our goals. However, the main difference between the options is the direction in which the clothespin is turned. Turning the clothespin towards you (Option A) may result in slightly tighter alignment and grip between the two pieces of fabric, as it's easier to control and manage the pin as you're working with the direction of your force. Therefore, Option A can be considered more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, as the slightly tighter alignment and grip achieved by turning the clothespin towards you may help better maintain fabric alignment and prevent slipping or movement during sewing or handling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Independent candidate Greg Orman is leading incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas by 10 points, while Democrats have a slim lead in North Carolina’s contest and both candidates are in a dead heat in Iowa’s Senate race, new NBC News/Marist polls find. The Kansas poll, which shows Roberts trailing 38 percent to Orman’s 48 percent, is full of bad news for the incumbent and for Republicans, who have suddenly seen Roberts’ sleepy re-election race turn into a very real pickup opportunity for Democrats if Orman decides to caucus with them. Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, left, answers a question during a debate with independent candidate Greg Orman listens during a debate at the Kansas State Fair Saturday, Sept. 6, 2014, in Hutchinson, Kan. “He’s in a great deal of trouble out there,” Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said of Roberts. “He’s got high negatives, his intensity of support is low, he’s losing independents by more than two to one. His to-do list is rather large in the remaining time before Election Day.” In the North Carolina Senate contest, Democrat Kay Hagan has a slight advantage over Republican Thom Tillis – 44 percent to 40 percent among likely voters, while the Iowa Senate race between Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley remains neck and neck, 46 percent to 44 percent. Republicans can boast of having the strongest candidate out of the three state polls: Incumbent Gov. Terry Branstad, who’s up by 22 points over Democrat Jack Hatch. But another Republican governor is in the fight of his political life. Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is locked in a dead heat with Democrat Paul Davis, 43 percent to 44 percent. While some Democrats are faring somewhat better than expected in North Carolina and Kansas, any resilience they are showing isn’t exactly due to an outpouring of positive sentiment in each state towards their party’s leader, President Barack Obama. Obama’s job approval rating sags at 39 percent in North Carolina, 39 percent in Iowa, and just 35 percent in Kansas. The unexpected shakeup in the Kansas race after Democrat Chad Taylor’s abrupt exit knocked longtime Sen. Pat Roberts onto his heels. Only 37 percent of likely voters say they have a positive opinion of the incumbent, who’s seeking his fourth term in the Senate, compared to 47 percent who have a negative opinion. Over 45 percent of likely voters give Orman a thumbs up. Orman is also benefiting from cross-party appeal. Seventy-seven percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans say they’re picking Orman over Roberts. Just eight percent of Democrats support Roberts, meaning that he’s losing two Republican voters for every Democrat he gains. He’s got high negatives, his intensity of support is low, he’s losing independents by more than two to one. His to-do list is rather large in the remaining time before Election Day. Orman is also winning independents by more than two-to-one, picking up 57 percent of independent support while Roberts gets just 27 percent. And a majority of Orman’s backers – 55 percent – say they’re backing the independent candidate mostly because they’re against his opponents. The silver lining for Roberts: Orman remains relatively undefined. Among likely voters who back him, only 48 percent say they’re firmly committed to him. And 28 percent of likely voters say they haven’t heard of him or aren’t sure of their opinion about him. Randall Batson, a libertarian candidate, is picking up about 5 percent support, according to the poll. Gov. Sam Brownback is also struggling among key demographics as he fights to keep his job amid the backlash from a series of unpopular budget cuts. While 85 percent of Democrats support their candidate, Paul Davis, more than two in ten Republicans say they’re not ready to back Brownback. Davis is winning independents 49 percent to 34 percent. Brownback's job approval rating among likely voters sits at 40 percent. Twenty-two percent of Republicans and 62 percent of independents give him a thumbs down for the job he's doing as governor. A gap in gender and marital status characterizes the close contest between Democrat Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis in North Carolina. Hagan carries women by 19 points and has almost a three-to-one advantage with single women, while Tillis is winning men by 13 points and ahead with married men by 23 points. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., greets supporters during a visit to a campaign field office in Goldsboro, N.C., Monday, Aug. 25, 2014. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) Hagan gets 84 percent of the African American vote, while Tillis leads among white likely voters, 52 percent to 31 percent. A barrage of negative advertising has taken its toll on both candidates, who each have upside-down favorable ratings. Forty-eight percent of likely voters have a negative view of Hagan, while 42 percent have a favorable one; for Tillis, the split is 47 percent unfavorable / 36 percent favorable. Libertarian candidate Sean Haugh takes seven percent of the vote. Ernst has a narrow lead of two points in this race, within the margin of error. But she appears to have an advantage when it comes to enthusiasm. “It’s all much more about Ernst than it is about Braley,” Miringoff says. Republican senatorial candidate State Sen. Joni Ernst, makes a statement to the media after her debate with Democratic senatorial candidates Rep. Bruce Braley, at Simpson College Sunday, Sept. 28, 2014, in Indianola, Iowa. (AP Photo/Justin Hayworth) More than six in ten Ernst supporters said they chose her because they actively support her candidacy, while 34 percent said their backing of Ernst was a protest against Braley. But those numbers were flipped for the Democratic candidate. About six in ten Braley backers said their vote was mostly due to opposition to Ernst. And 62 percent of Ernst supporters were firm in their decision between the candidates, compared to 51 percent for Braley. The polls were conducted September 27th through October 1st. The margin of error n the North Carolina poll is +/- 3.8 percentage points. The margin of error for the Iowa poll is +/- 3.5 percentage points. The margin of error for the Kansas poll is +/- 3.9 percentage points.

Stoker wrote the book after reading stories about Central European vampires and set his novel in Transylvania. Even today,there are readers of the book who believe that Transylvania is a mythical country,a figment of Stoker's imagination. Nothing could be further from the truth. Transylvania is part of modern-day Central European country Romania,and the country does indeed have a history of mythological vampires. However,Romanians are always puzzled by the description of the novel's central character, Count Dracula,a tall,elegant aristocrat with impeccable manners who also happens to speak very good English. This is a world away from the images of vampires that they have grown up with. Romanian vampires are half-human creatures who live solitary lives in the forests,not aristocrats living in castles with well-stocked libraries. So where did Stoke get the image for his Dracula? The answer becomes clearer when one learns of his relationship with a man called Henry Irving,the greatest British stage actor of his time. Stoker was working as a civil servant in his home city of Dublin when he first met Irving. Bored with his tedious life and work, Stoker took every opportunity to visit the theatre and for a while was the drama critic for the Dublin Evening Mail. One of the reviews he wrote was of a performance of Shakespeare's play Hamlet,with Irving in the lead role. Irving was so pleased with Stoker's review of his performance that he asked to meet him. Stoker couldn't believe his luck when one night,he was invited to a dinner party where Irving was the guest of honour.

Input: Britney Spears bravely agrees to release un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally-altered versions            Celebrities, and the industry around them, are often accused of producing images that affect young people's body image.      Which is why it's so refreshing to see one of the world's most famous pop stars allowing all of their imperfections to be highlighted.      Britney Spears has allowed the pre-airbrushed images from a shoot she took part in for fashion firm Candie's to be used ALONGSIDE the digitally-altered ones, so people can see the difference.      Brave move: Britney Spears has allowed airbrushed images from her shoot to be released along with the original raw photos which show all her imperfections            The 29-year-old singer made the extraordinary move in order to highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect.      In the first shot, she is seen facing the camera with her arms behind her back.      Imperfections that can be clearly seen in the un-airbrushed shot include blemishes on her calf, her larger thighs and, if you look really closely, you can see her feet have dry skin on them.      The airbrushed pictures, however, tell a different story with a slimmed-down waist and flawless, skinny legs.      Meanwhile, in the second picture, she is seen from the back - in the un-airbrushed shot she has areas of cellulite on the back of her thighs, a tattoo on her lower back (sometimes called a 'tramp stamp') is clearly visible and her backside is a little out of shape.      However, in the altered photo all of these imperfections have been wiped out - and she appears to have a pert rear, unrealistically smooth skin, slimmer legs and the tattoo has vanished.      Shaping up: The pop star's whole body has been trimmed down with the use of a computer, even down to removing a tattoo on her back            A source told the Daily Mirror newspaper: 'Britney is proud of her body - imperfections and all.'

Answer a question about this article: The Napoleonic Wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German nation state in 19th-century German nationalism. After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity. Jewish German Eduard Lasker was a prominent German nationalist figure who promoted the unification of Germany in the mid-19th century. When was the Crimean War?","output":"The Crimean War took place from 1853 to 1856. It was a conflict involving the Russian Empire against an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. The war was primarily fought on the Crimean Peninsula and resulted from disputes between Russia and the Ottoman Empire over territories and religious issues in the Holy Land. The impact of the war regionalized beyond the involved powers as it contributed to weakening the Concert of Europe established by the Congress of Vienna. Consequently, this created an opportunity for aspiring nation-states, like Germany, to pursue their unification goals, as seen in the 1860s under Otto von Bismarck's leadership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \\"lay it on\\" is American slang for \\"to tell\\" or \\"to explain.\\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served.  If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\".  A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. Question: Which of the following is NOT true for slang compared with the official language? Yes or no, is the answer \\"More official\\"? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"More official\\" is not true for slang compared with the official language. Slang is generally considered less official compared to the traditional version of a language. Official language tends to be more formal, consistent, and respectful in comparison to slang, which can be playful, more direct, and sometimes less respectful. Slang is an important part of a living language and reflects constant changes in language. It can be specific to certain regions, age groups, or professions and often reflects current trends in culture and society. While slang can become part of the officially accepted language over time, it remains less official on the whole. So, the answer is \\"Yes,\\" more official is not true for slang compared to the official language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Folding a bedsheet can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with large sheets like queen or king-sized ones. However, with a step-by-step process, you can accomplish this goal efficiently and neatly. Here's a detailed guide on how to fold a bedsheet: 1. Identify the type of bedsheet: First, determine whether it is a flat bedsheet or a fitted one. Flat sheets are essentially large rectangles, while fitted sheets have elastic corners that help secure them to the mattress. For flat bedsheets: 1.1. Hold the sheet lengthwise: Begin by holding the sheet from the shorter end so that the whole length of the sheet hangs down. 1.2. Align the corners: If the sheet is large or unwieldy, ask for assistance. Hold the top two corners of the sheet and bring your hands together, folding the sheet in half. Make sure to align the corners and the edges to minimize wrinkles. 1.3. Hold the new corners: Fold the sheet in half again by bringing your left-hand corner over to the right. Align the corners and edges accordingly. At this point, you should have four layers of the folded sheet. 1.4. Lay the sheet down flat: Gently put the folded sheet on a flat surface like a table or bed, and smoothen out any wrinkles. 1.5. Fold lengthwise: Fold the sheet lengthwise into thirds. Adjust the final fold according to the desired sheet width, ensuring that the sheet edges are straight and wrinkle-free. 1.6. Fold widthwise: Fold the sheet widthwise, either in half or into thirds, depending on the size of your storage space and your preferences. The final result should be a neat, compact square or rectangle. For fitted bedsheets: 2.1. Hold the sheet lengthwise: Begin by holding the sheet from the shorter end so that the whole length of the sheet hangs down, with elastic sides facing up. 2.2. Tuck the corners in: Put your hands inside the top two corners of the sheet and bring them down to the bottom two corners, tucking the top corners into the bottom ones. Make sure the elastic edges nest together to create a neat fold. 2.3. Hold the new corners: While holding the tucked corners with one hand, run your other hand along the elastic edge to smoothen out any wrinkles. 2.4. Lay the sheet down flat: Gently put the folded sheet on a flat surface like a table or bed, ensuring that the elastic edges are lined up. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands. 2.5. Fold lengthwise: If the sheet is still too wide, fold it lengthwise into thirds. Adjust the final fold according to the desired sheet width, aligning the edges and making sure the sheet remains wrinkle-free. 2.6. Fold widthwise: Fold the sheet widthwise, either in half or into thirds, depending on the size of your storage space and your preferences. The final result should be a neat, compact square or rectangle. Remember that practice makes perfect when folding bedsheets. With time and repetition, you can develop a technique that works best for you, ensuring that your sheets are always tidy and well-organized."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America Movie plot: Two Viking men are stranded in northeastern North America when their party of explorers loses a battle with Skraelings (indigenous peoples). The two men move northward, hoping to link up with an expedition led by Leif Ericson. They deal differently with the grim situation, one turning inward spiritually and the other reverting to a primal state, but both men are beset with memories of their earlier lives. Orn (Tony Stone) remembers his wife (Gaby Hoffmann), and Volnard (Fiore Tedesco) flashes back to his childhood home and his Christian sister (Clare Amory) who committed suicide after Volnard killed the man who converted her to Christianity. Traveling, they encounter two Irish monks who have escaped from another Viking partyâone monk (Sean Dooley) is murdered at first, and a makeshift Christian church is burned down. The other monk (David Perry) joins the journey. The Viking men disagree about the monk and they separate. On his own, Orn meets a beautiful native Abenaki woman (Noelle Bailey) who drugs and rapes him. Volnard bonds with the surviving Christian monk who washes his feet.

Afte a Colts three-and-out, the Patriots drove to Colts 22 and Gostkowski made a 39-yard field goal. After another Colts punt, Mike Adams intercepted Brady and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown. The Colts bizarrely tried an onside kick, but the Patriots recovered at their own 35. It took just four plays to score, with Blount busting off a 38-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17-14 lead early in the second quarter. The Colts countered yet again, though. Stringing together a 10 play, 80-yard drive, scoring on 3-yard touchdown pass from Luck to T. Y. Hilton, giving the Colts the lead again 21-17. The Patriots drove to the Colts 7 and Brady hit Chandler for a 7-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified on a pass interference call on Chandler. Gostkowski kicked a 35-yard field goal on the next play, giving the Colts a 21-20 lead at halftime. The Patriots took the first drive of the second half, driving 80 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, giving the Patriots the lead again 27-21. Four possessions later, the Colts reached the Patriots 37 and attempted a trick play on fourth down where nine players lined up wide right, while Griff Whalen lined up at center and Colt Anderson lined up as a quarterback, hoping to catch the Patriots offsides; the play failed and Anderson was sacked for a one-yard loss, leading a befuddled Al Michaels in the NBC Sports booth to mutter, \\"What in the world?\\" The Patriots declined an illegal formation penalty on the play. Taking over at the Colts 35, the Patriots needed just 6 plays, scoring on an 11-yard screen pass from Brady to Blount, increasing their lead to 34-21 a few plays into the fourth quarter. Several possessions later, the Colts drove to the Patriots 38, but turned the ball over on downs again. However, the Colts forced a quick three-and-out, and raced 85 yard in 8 plays, scoring on Luck's 18-yard touchdown pass to Whalen, with a missed extra point from Adam Vinatieri, keeping the score 34-27 with just 1:19 left. Gronkowski recovered the Colts onside kick attempt and Brady took two knees to end the game. This was the Patriots sixth straight win in the series.

In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.[citation needed] Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.[citation needed] In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.[citation needed] If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where has the rule of law been more of a theory than a way of life?","output":"The rule of law has been more of a theory than a way of life in several countries around the world, often due to various factors such as political instability, corruption, and social inequality. In these countries, the rule of law is touted as a cornerstone of democracy, but its implementation often falls short, leading to challenges in promoting fair and equal justice for all citizens. Some examples of countries where the rule of law has faced significant challenges include: 1. Thailand: As mentioned earlier, Thailand's history of political instability, coups, and entrenched royalist principles has created an environment where the rule of law often struggles to be a way of life. The judiciary and other branches of government have been tainted by political bias and interference, undermining the public's faith in the legal system's impartiality. 2. Russia: Russia has been known for having a legal system that is seen as susceptible to political interference, with a lack of an independent judiciary. Some critics argue that the judicial system in Russia is heavily influenced by the country's political elite, leading to instances of selective justice and limited accountability for those in power. 3. Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe has experienced significant political unrest and economic instability over the past few decades. The rule of law has been challenged by the government's actions, including land seizures, widespread human rights abuses, and suppression of political opposition. This has led to an environment where the rule of law is more of a theory than a way of life. 4. Venezuela: Venezuela's ongoing political and economic crisis has severely damaged the country's legal system. The increasing authoritarianism of the government, along with rampant corruption, has undermined the judiciary's independence and the rule of law in general. 5. North Korea: The rule of law in North Korea is heavily compromised by the country's totalitarian political system and lack of transparency. The legal system is dominated by the ruling party and its leaders, with limited opportunities for judicial independence or public accountability. These are just a few examples of countries where the rule of law has been more of a theory than a way of life. In many of these cases, the lack of a robust and independent legal system has contributed to issues of corruption, human rights abuses, and the erosion of democratic principles. To effectively address these challenges, it is crucial for governments, international organizations, and civil society to work towards strengthening the institutions that underpin the rule of law and promote greater transparency, accountability, and fairness for all citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Commas are needed to separate the descriptive words at the beginning of the sentence — \\"Charming,\\" \\"vintage,\\" and \\"French\\" — given that they all describe the \\"wicker mannequin bust.\\" 2.  A comma is also necessary after the word “head,\\" because the phrase \\"with head\\" provides additional information about the mannequin bust. 3. The time (circa 1900s) is a separate concept, which needs to be separated off by commas from the rest of the sentence.  4. The phrase \\"has a certain patina\\" is the beginning of a new clause and thus needs to be separated from the previous part about \\"circa 1900s\\" by a comma. 5.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Pope Zachary (679  15 March 752) reigned from 3 December or 5 December 741 to his death in 752. A Greek from Santa Severina, Calabria, he was the last pope of the Byzantine Papacy. Most probably he was a deacon of the Roman Church and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732 and was on intimate terms with Gregory III, whom he succeeded on 5 December 741.  - Childeric III ( c. 717 -- c. 754 ) was King of Francia from 743 until he was deposed by Pope Zachary in March 751 at the instigation of Pepin the Short . Although his parentage is uncertain , he is considered the last Frankish king from the Merovingian dynasty . Once Childeric was deposed , Pepin the Short , who was the father of emperor Charlemagne , was crowned the first king of the Franks from the Carolingian dynasty .  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - Pepin the Short (, c. 714  24 September 768) was the King of the Franks from 751 until his death. He was the first of the Carolingians to become king.  - The Byzantine Papacy was a period of Byzantine domination of the papacy from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the Byzantine Emperor for episcopal consecration, and many popes were chosen from the \\"apocrisiarii\\" (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of Byzantine Greece, Byzantine Syria, or Byzantine Sicily. Justinian I conquered the Italian peninsula in the Gothic War (535554) and appointed the next three popes, a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the Exarchate of Ravenna.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

Movie title: Atom Age Vampire Context: When a singer (Susanne Loret) is horribly disfigured in a car accident, a scientist (Dr. Levin, played by Alberto Lupo) develops a treatment which can restore her beauty by injecting her with a special serum. While performing the procedure, however, he falls in love with her. As the treatment begins to fail, he determines to save her appearance, regardless of how many women he must kill for her sake. Despite the implication of its American title, the film does not feature an actual vampire. The titular Seddok is actually the brilliant but deranged scientist Dr. Levin, mutated by a chemical formula created using radiation. Dr. Levin studied the effects of radiation on living tissue in post-Hiroshima Japan, and created an imperfect and teratogenic serum, \\"Derma 25\\", which he later refined into the miraculous healing agent \\"Derma 28\\" which he uses to treat the heroine. When his supply of Derma 28 runs out, he realizes he must kill to obtain more, and injects himself with Derma 25 in order to become monstrous and remorseless, so that he may seek these victims without hesitation. Because many of the murders take place near the docks where shiploads of Japanese refugees are arriving, and leave behind the victims' bodies with holes in the neck where Dr. Levin has extracted the glands, the refugees claim that a vampire (whom they call \\"Seddok\\", though this is not a Japanese name) is responsible for the attacks. During a meeting with police, a restored-to-humanity Dr. Levin speculates that the Hiroshima survivors' tales of a mutated killer are due to psychological strain from the radiation damage to their bodies...but also wonders aloud whether the \\"vampire\\" these witnesses describe might simply be a disturbed man wishing to be normal again.

Let's break down each sentence and compare their meaning: 1. \\"In the 1990s, Schwartz worked in the adult film industry in minor, non-sexual roles, and behind the scenes in numerous administrative roles.\\" This sentence emphasizes that Schwartz worked in the adult film industry in the 1990s. Here, the focus is on the fact that they worked in minor, non-sexual roles, as well as behind the scenes in several administrative positions. The sentence structure showcases that the adult film industry is the primary setting of their work, and then provides details about the types of roles they were involved in. 2. \\"In the 1990s, Schwartz worked in smaller, non-sexual roles in the adult film industry and in numerous administrative roles behind the scenes.\\" This sentence, while also indicating that Schwartz worked in the adult film industry in the 1990s, focuses more on the roles they performed. The two main types of roles - smaller, non-sexual roles, and administrative roles behind the scenes - are presented as equally important in this context.

It's a highly anticipated comeback as the Uruguayan forward has been serving a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Despite the lengthy ban, Suarez's talent and potential have not gone unnoticed by Barcelona, and his return is expected to be a spark for the team. The controversy surrounding Suarez's actions in the World Cup clash against Italy drew global attention, resulting in a heavy sanction handed to the striker. The four-month ban has significantly affected Suarez's ability to make an immediate impact at his new club, but Barcelona has remained committed to integrating him into the team once his suspension is lifted. Suarez, who scored 31 goals in 33 games for Liverpool in his final season with the English football club, will aim for a strong performance in the training match against Barcelona B, as he looks to regain his footing after the extensive time away from football. This match is expected to provide Suarez with an excellent opportunity to integrate with his new teammates and showcase his skillset. Suarez's participation in training matches during his ban period is a strategic move by the Catalan giants, as he has been unable to participate in any official club activities. This calculated decision allows Suarez to maintain his match fitness and generate confidence in his abilities before his return to the big stage. Suarez is anticipated to form a formidable attacking trio with Barça's star players - Lionel Messi and Neymar, creating a fearsome force that could potentially dominate European football. The prospect of these three talents combining on the field has football enthusiasts and experts buzzing with excitement, making his debut highly awaited and raising expectations for the team throughout the season. Fans and football pundits alike are eager to see how Suarez's addition to the already-impressive Barcelona team will unfold. His prolific goal-scoring history, combined with his exceptional abilities, are expected to add depth and strength to the Catalan side, strengthening their position in both domestic and international competitions. The training match against Barcelona B is anticipated to be a pivotal moment in Suarez's career, serving as the litmus test of what's to come from the striker's next chapter at his new club. As Suarez is intensely focused on overcoming the stigma surrounding his ban and proving his value to the Barcelona side, his performance in this match will be instrumental in setting the tone for his future at the club. In conclusion, Luis Suarez's integration into the Barcelona team promises excitement and intrigue as football fans eagerly await his return to the playing field. The upcoming training match against Barcelona B is set to be a crucial moment indicative of the Uruguayan forward's potential impact on his new team’s journey in the world of football – an impact everyone is waiting to witness."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: Great debut!!

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Actress Patricia Modell, who was married to former Cleveland Browns/Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell, died Wednesday, the Ravens organization announced. She was 80.

Modell, also known as Patricia Breslin, appeared on television, film, and the New York stage during her 22-year acting career, the Ravens said. Her most widely known role was as nurse Meg Bentley in the daytime soap opera General Hospital in the late 1960s, and she also played Laura Brooks on the primetime TV drama \\"Peyton Place.\\"  Modell was also a regular on \\"Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\\" \\"Perry Mason,\\" and \\"Maverick.\\"  At one point, the Ravens said, Modell had appeared in more television shows than any other woman in U.S. history. Her record was eventually broken by one of her closest friends, the late Lucille Ball.  Modell retired from acting after the couple married in 1969 and became involved in philanthropy. In Cleveland, she did work for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Cerebral Palsy Association, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.  She and her husband started and funded the Hospice of the Western Reserve in Cleveland.  Modell was a major contributor in Baltimore to the St. Vincent's Center and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modells contributed 3.5 million to the Lyric Opera House, which was recently renamed the Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric.

Given the question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. When do you make colomba?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Tough Questions for Obama About ObamaCare At least ABC News White House Correspondent Jake Tapper is doing his job. At one of those extremely rare presidential press conferences, Tapper asked President Obama how he reconciled his claim before ObamaCare passed that reform would lower health care costs with the fact that a new government report—plus, I might add, every news story on the topic—says health care costs are rising. Good question that; wish the answer had been also. The president replied, “I said at the time, it wasn’t going to happen tomorrow, it wasn’t going to happen next year.” No, Mr. President, that’s not what you said. You claimed repeatedly that by the end of your first term a family health insurance policy would cost 2,500 less. Obama added, “as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins that’s going to increase our costs, we knew that.” But what you said last March was, “[M]y proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions—families, businesses, and the federal government.” Unfortunately, Tapper didn’t get to follow up and demand that the president answer the question truthfully, but maybe other journalists will. As ObamaCare hits its six-month anniversary, the president intends to go on yet another promotional tour. Let’s hope that other members of the press will raise serious questions—and demand serious answers—about the discrepancies between what the president said when he was trying to pass ObamaCare and what’s happening now. Questions such as: Is the health insurance mandate a tax or not? In a lively exchange, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked President Obama last fall if the mandate to have health insurance was a tax. “[F]or us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase,” the president replied. And the legislation concurs; it never refers to the mandate as a tax. Except that the Obama Justice Department now says it absolutely is a tax. At least it’s making that claim before judges considering the constitutionality of the mandate. The reason Justice is calling the mandate a tax is Congress has the constitutional authority to levy taxes; it does not have any constitutional authority to tell people they have to buy health insurance. So if the administration can convince the judges—and eventually the Supreme Court—the mandate is a tax, the mandate may have a better chance of being ruled constitutional. But it would sure be nice if someone in the media would ask the president, yes or no, whether he still believes the mandate is not a tax. And if it isn’t, why is he letting Justice claim it is? Will people be able to keep their current policy? The president repeatedly asserted they would. And yet report after report shows that within the next few years many if not most people will lose their current coverage—because of ObamaCare. For one thing, some health insurers are dropping out of the traditional health insurance market. Others are dropping some of their current offerings. For example, Wellpoint, Cigna and CoventryOne have decided to stop offering child-only policies because of new rules going into effect this week forcing them to accept any child applicant (separate from a family policy). And there are growing concerns that many employers will take the easy and less-expensive way out: stop offering coverage and let their employees go into the health insurance exchanges, scheduled to start in 2014. So would some reporter ask the president if he is disappointed that so many people may not be able to keep their current coverage, as he promised? Will the cuts to Medicare hurt seniors? Seniors certainly think so; they’re the group most opposed to the legislation. ObamaCare cuts 575 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, and yet the president claimed his reform would “preserve and strengthen Medicare.” However, a new analysis by the Heritage Foundation of the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which covers nearly a quarter of seniors, predicts an average annual cut to MA plans of between 3,000 and 5,000 per beneficiary, depending on the state. And those cuts mean a 38% to 62% reduction in seniors participating in MA plans, again depending on the state. Then there’s a new study on Medicare’s Part D prescription drug coverage from Avalere Health, which predicts that up to 3.7 million seniors could be forced to switch their prescription drug coverage. Finally, doctors are increasingly refusing to take new seniors because Medicare pays only about 78% of what private insurance pays. And there are potential reimbursement cuts of about 30% by the end of the year if nothing gets done. “Preserving and strengthening Medicare” is meaningless if a senior can’t find a doctor taking new Medicare patients. Obama repeatedly accused the critics of ObamaCare of trying to mislead the public. As he said on March 3, health care “easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship, and misrepresentation and misunderstanding.” Yes, Mr. President, it does. And no one has mastered that demagoguery better than you. It is time for you to stand up and answer some tough questions about the discrepancies between what you claimed about ObamaCare and what everyone now knows it the truth. Merrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, Texas. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text raises several important questions about ObamaCare and its discrepancies. Key questions include: 1. Is the health insurance mandate a tax or not? The Obama Justice Department claims it is a tax to defend its constitutionality, but President Obama denied it being a tax increase. 2. Will people be able to keep their current policy? Despite the president's assurance that they would, many reports suggest that people may lose their existing coverage due to ObamaCare's impact on insurance providers and their offerings. 3. Will the cuts to Medicare hurt seniors? ObamaCare aims to cut 575 billion from Medicare over ten years, and the text points out that seniors are the most opposed group to the legislation. The cuts will impact Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and Medicare's Part D prescription drug coverage. Additionally, doctors are increasingly reluctant to accept new Medicare patients due to lower reimbursement rates. The text argues that it is time for President Obama to address these tough questions and discrepancies in what he claimed about ObamaCare and the realities of its implementation."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Thomas Edward \\"Thom\\" Yorke (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician best known as the singer and principal songwriter of the alternative rock band Radiohead.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Small businesses see revenue gains, hire workers NEW YORK — The long-awaited surge in hiring at small businesses appears to be underway. Owners who resisted hiring after the recession are taking on workers to keep up with rising demand for products and services. Companies began stepping up their hiring pace in the spring. Faulkner Hyundai in Harrisburg, Pa., is adding seven people to its staff of 92 because new cars are selling at their fastest rate in eight years. The market for used cars is also strong. ‘‘Managers are actually getting involved in selling cars because we don’t have enough salespeople,’’ says Paul Selvaggi, president of the dealership and service center. Faulkner has hired a sales manager, its first new employee since the third quarter of last year. Up next: salespeople, workers to service cars, and employees who develop new sources of revenue. Small businesses held off hiring until they had enough business to justify taking more risks. As recently as March, an American Express survey found 76 percent of owners planned to hire only when their revenue rose. The ripple effect from growth in construction and consumer spending is feeding the increase, says Susan Woodward, an economist who helps software maker Intuit compile its hiring surveys. Liliana Aranda’s business began picking up in March. Her four-year-old company, Faces By Liliana, gives facials, massages, and other spa treatments in homes or offices in the San Francisco area. Her business has done well since its start, but she never needed to hire. When clients held spa parties for their friends, she looked for freelancers to help. In early spring, Aranda suddenly started getting more appointments. She attributes the bump in business to people splurging again after the recession and its aftermath. ‘‘They make a point of saying, I’ve earned this, I’m going to treat myself, and I’m not afraid to spend a little more,’’ she says. The size of Aranda’s spa parties was larger than in the past — 11 to 14 people compared to six to eight. Revenue is up 20 percent so far this year. The increase in business made hiring three part-time employees who she could always rely on a necessity. The recovery in South Florida’s real estate market and economy has allowed Tadd Schwartz’s public relations firm to step up its hiring. Schwartz Media Strategies usually hired one or two employees annually the past six years, but in the last three months, he has added three full-time staffers and two interns, putting his payroll at 17. That’s up from 12 staffers a year ago. Schwartz has been confident enough to hire before sealing a deal with new clients. He wants to have enough people on staff to hit the ground running when a contract is signed. ‘‘We want to position our firm so we’re not only able to service our clients, but be in a position where we don’t have to say no to the right client,’’ he says. Schwartz Media’s revenue is up about 16 percent so far in 2014. If Schwartz lands two or three more big accounts, he says, he will start recruiting again. Publicity the last few months about Brad Barrett’s product Grill Grate sent orders for the backyard grill accessory soaring. Barrett, who was cautious while building his seven-year-old company, had six employees including himself and his wife. He expected that to be enough. But orders flooded in faster than expected, and over the Independence Day weekend, the Barretts had to fill orders themselves for their product, which creates a raised grilling surface for backyard grills. ‘‘We were inside the entire weekend,’’ he says. Barrett is now looking for two workers for the Cartersville, Ga., company — one to help fill orders and the other to handle administrative and marketing tasks. ‘‘We’ve waited perhaps a bit too long. Business is up substantially and the six of us are scrambling,’’ Barrett says. Barrett expected his revenue to grow 40 percent in 2014, but sales of Grill Grate are already up 55 percent from this time last year. ‘‘We’ve only made a small dent in the amount of replacements that need to be done,’’ says Marcus, whose company has 18 employees in Tempe, Ariz., and five in Woodland Hills, Calif. The economy is also a factor in Marcus’s 29 percent revenue surge this year. Small business clients are hiring workers who need computers. And companies that delayed replacing XP systems because of cash flow problems have more money. ‘‘They’re saying, ‘We’ve held out for so long, now we just have to do this,’ ’’ he says.","output":"Small businesses in the US are witnessing a surge in hiring as they keep up with the rising demand for products and services.

Article:","output":"Title: Unprecedented Long-Term Repair Job Underway as Queensland Flood Crisis Continues Introduction: The torrential rain and widespread flooding that has plagued Queensland since November 30, 2021, continues to unfold as a significant disaster. With the death toll rising and thousands being evacuated from their homes, authorities are faced with the monumental task of long-term repair and recovery. Step 1: Discuss the scale of the destruction and officials' statements. As floodwaters continue to wreak havoc on Queensland state, officials warn that the disaster will require an \\"unprecedented long-term repair job.\\" The scope of the devastation is immense, with entire roads submerged and countless homes and businesses damaged beyond repair. As one official commented, the recovery period will be extensive and unlike anything previously experienced in the region. Step 2: Describe the current situation and ongoing challenges. In the face of this disaster, many residents are still struggling to adapt to the new normal. For those living in areas with roads underwater, the only mode of transportation has become boats, turning once bustling streets into makeshift waterways. Emergency services are stretched to their limit as they scramble to rescue stranded individuals and provide much-needed relief to those affected. Step 3: Provide statistics on evacuations and the death toll. The severity of the situation is underscored by the growing number of evacuations across the flood-affected areas. Nearly 2,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Queensland state as authorities work tirelessly to prevent further loss of life. Tragically, police have confirmed that at least 10 people have lost their lives due to the flooding since November 30. Step 4: Address the ongoing efforts and long-term impacts of the crisis. Despite the challenges posed by the disaster, both individual and communal resilience is shining through. Emergency services, volunteers, and even residents-turned-first-responders are working around the clock to help one another. However, as the focus shifts toward long-term recovery, it is clear that the road ahead will be long and filled with obstacles.

According to the provided excerpt, members who did not practice the physical craft were known as \\"accepted\\" or \\"speculative\\" Masons. However, the statement also provides additional context and history about the origins and transformation of local trade organizations into today's Masonic Lodges. A more detailed and long answer would be: Freemasonry has its roots in the Lodges of operative masons, the skilled craftsmen who built medieval Europe's cathedrals, churches, and castles. As the need for these highly specialized skills decreased and architectural knowledge became more widely available, the focus of the Lodges began to shift. By the 17th and 18th centuries, more and more men who had no direct experience in the stonemason trade started joining these Lodges. These new members, who did not practice the physical craft, were referred to as \\"accepted\\" or \\"speculative\\" Masons. Instead of working with stone and building tools, these accepted or speculative Masons embraced the philosophical, moral, and social aspects of the Craft. Although there isn't a clear step-by-step transformation of how local trade organizations of operative masons eventually became the modern Masonic Lodges, there are certain evidences of continuity. For instance, the rituals and passwords discovered from operative lodges around the turn of the 17th to the 18th century demonstrate parallels with the ones later developed and used by accepted or speculative Masons. As the Lodges continued to evolve, the focus shifted from the practical stonemason's craft to a more symbolic interpretation. In essence, the Freemasonry of today has become more focused on the spiritual, moral, and philosophical aspects of the Craft, rather than its operative origins. The \\"accepted\\" or \\"speculative\\" Masons, those who did not practice the physical craft, are now the mainstay of modern Freemasonry, and it's their presence that has expanded and carried the fraternity into the present day. Today, the Masonic Lodges are no longer strictly associated with the physical craft of masonry, but instead, use the symbolic elements of the craft as a foundation for promoting morality, fraternity, and charitable works."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

The title captures the essence of the story, wherein the characters' plight during the Nanking Massacre emphasizes their vulnerability. Yet, together, they form an unlikely alliance in the sanctuary of the cathedral. Their defiance shines through amidst the horrors of war, as seen when the prostitutes choose to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party, and when John Miller pretends to be a priest to keep everyone safe.

In this statement, the speaker addresses an important matter concerning the British government's actions with regard to the Finucane family and the European Parliament. The implication is that there has been some level of secrecy or obfuscation on the part of the British government, and the speaker is now bringing this issue to light in order to hold them accountable for their actions. The Finucane family referred to in this statement may be in relation to the well-known case of Pat Finucane, a Belfast-based lawyer who was assassinated in 1989 during the period of political conflict in Northern Ireland known as The Troubles. His murder was highly controversial and has been the subject of ongoing investigation due to allegations of collusion between the British security forces and the loyalist paramilitaries who carried out the assassination. Although a number of inquiries have been conducted, the Finucane family has continuously pressed for a full independent public inquiry into the matter.

Now, it costs you some money to make the lemonade, like buying lemons, sugar, and cups. Let's say that cost is 0.50 per lemonade. Gross profit is the money you're left with after subtracting the cost of making the lemonades from the sales revenue. So, if you sold 10 lemonades and each one cost you 0.50 to make, your total cost would be 5. Then, you would subtract that from your sales revenue (10 - 5), and your gross profit would be 5.

Article: A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \\"leader\\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion  against the rules and conditions of the experiment.

Given that he is the subject of the article, it is most logical to presume that the completion of the sentence refers to the team's investment in Kovalainen himself, over their first three years of competition.  In this context, the 'investing' pertains to the resources the team would have put into providing Kovalainen with the equipment, support personnel, and technical backing necessary to perform at the highest level of motor racing. This kind of investment doesn't merely involve financial resources, but also the time and effort the team spends helping the driver gel with the team's mechanics, engineers, and other supporting staff, in order to foster a smooth working relationship. It also includes the time spent on helping him get to grips with the unique technical aspects of the team's cars.  Given this, it makes most sense to suppose that the team would want to leverage the valuable expertise that Kovalainen has gained over his three years of competition when he takes on his new technical development role. His experience can provide vital insights that can help the team improve their performance and possibly outshine their rivals, making the investment worthwhile.  It's also essential to note that developing a successful Formula One driver isn't a short-term endeavor, but something that typically takes numerous seasons. This is due to the fiercely competitive nature of the sport, as well as the complexity of the cars and the numerous regulations that teams must navigate. This further underscores the relevance and appropriateness of completing the sentence with Kovalainen's name, taking into account the team's long-term investment in him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September.

Here's a detailed analysis of the rating: 1. Lack of clarity: The review lacks clarity regarding the specific product or service. The user's complaint about not being able to find or open any FB2 files suggests that their experience relates to a file viewer or converter application. However, without any context or mention of the product or service name, it is impossible for other users to understand the issue entirely. 2. Spelling and grammar errors: The review contains multiple spelling and grammar errors, such as \\"WTF\\" (an informal and provocative abbreviation), \\"Didnt\\" instead of \\"didn't,\\" \\"waist\\" instead of \\"waste,\\" and improper use of spaces and punctuation. These errors make the review appear less professional and lower its credibility. 3. Lack of informative content: A favorable review should provide constructive feedback or specific information about the experience and areas of improvement. In this case, the user only states their dissatisfaction without offering any helpful details to guide potential users or the service provider in addressing the problem. 4. Negativity and emotional tone: While expressing dissatisfaction or negative experiences is valid, the tone of the review seems excessively emotional and lacks objectivity. Using phrases such as \\"total disaster\\" and \\"waist of time\\" can come across as exaggerated and may not provide an accurate representation of the user's experience. In conclusion, this review earns the lowest rating on the scale due to its lack of clarity, spelling and grammar errors, absence of informative content, and negative emotional tone.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was one of the first people to study conservation? ?  Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Economist Debates: Marriage Government should not necessarily encourage marriage, but it should definitely discontinue the predatory government and private/public government partnerships through which it DISCOURAGES marriage. What are these? Follow the goings on in any divorce court in a Western country and you will see, especially in America, how deeply government is involved in deterring males from marrying and reproducing, and brutally punishing them when they do. The \\"punishment\\" is both economic and human (denial of custody of one's children -- needed to justify the economic punishment). All of this horrible treatment of productive males is necessary to feed the male's assets and income as \\"fees\\" to the lawyer friends of America's lawyer-controlled judiciaries and legislatures. I will add here my comments from elsewhere in this blog about the origins of America's fertility crisis, as follows: The birth rate in America is not falling primarily because of the problems in the American macro-economy during the past 5 years. It is falling because of the horrible and unacceptable economic risk distribution inflicted by government upon American males, especially educated, economically productive and white males. Quite simply, when an economically productive male in America gets married, he experiences a very high probability (in excess of 50%) that the woman he marries will ultimately divorce him. When that happens, he is extremely likely to be stripped of assets by private attorneys benefiting from judicial assistance in that attorney-feeding process, and to couple has children (whether married or not), the male is virtually guaranteed to be sold into indentured servitude, under the threat of imprisonment lest he fail to make enough money to pay whatever \\"support\\" award is affixed to his head by America's local-lawyer controlled judiciary. American men, young, middle-aged, and old, are now crystal clear in their understanding of this rigged game and how dangerous it is to them. A 50% or greater probability of having their lives ruined is not acceptable to them, period. They were opting out of reproduction and marriage at record rates when the American economy was booming prior to the recent collapse, and they have and will continue to do so until reproduction becomes safe for them, and marriage as well. Who are the men who have the safest circumstances for reproducing in America? Illegal immigrants, of course. They can actually leave the place, and most likely with their children. It is the productive American male who is the target of government, as it is he who has income and assets which can be fed to America's 1.1 million lawyers, who are of course, operating in a many-decades partnership with state and local judges and government. America's fertility crisis among educated, productive males will not turn around when the economy turns around. Not by a long shot. Government has vast branches and large numbers of employees, especially in America, which feed off of the destruction and enslavement of productive males, and an unavoidable byproduct of this dirty, business is a deterrence of males from marriage and having children. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text can be summarized as follows: 1. The author argues that government policies and practices in divorce courts discourage marriage, particularly for economically productive males in Western countries, especially in America. 2. The \\"punishment\\" for these males when they divorce is both economic (loss of assets) and human (denial of custody of their children). 3. The author believes that this treatment is necessary to feed the male's assets and income as \\"fees\\" to the lawyers involved in the process, who benefit from their connections with the judiciary and legislatures. 4. The falling birth rate in America, according to the author, is primarily due to this unfair treatment of economically productive males who are increasingly avoiding marriage and reproduction to avoid the risks. 5. The author claims that illegal immigrants have safer circumstances for reproduction in America, as they can potentially leave the country with their children. 6. The text emphasizes that the fertility crisis among educated, productive males in America will not be resolved by an improving economy alone; the government's involvement and practices need to change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the original name of the structure that Titus inaugurated the completion of?  The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: At first, the earth's surface layer   was made up of huge blocks of hard, solid rocks. Then slowly, the rocks broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. Finally stones, pebbles   and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Question: Which of the following speeds up  the breaks of rocks most? Answer: OPT: [i] Hot weather. [ii] Cold water. [iii] Sharp changes in temperature. [iv] More dead plants in the cracks.

Article: Air pollution is a leading cause of cancer and classified among Group 1,or top, human carcinogens  , said the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is the World Health Organization's (WHO) cancer agency, on Oct 17,2013. The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC, which places them into five groups. Group 1 carcinogens definitely cause cancer in humans. Group 2A is probably carcinogenic to humans, Group 2B is possibly carcinogenic, the carcinogenicity of Group 3 in humans is unclassifiable, and Group 4 is probably not carcinogenic to humans. Only a little more than 100 are classified as Group 1 cancer-causing substances, including ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke. \\"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\\" the lARC's Dana Loomis said in a statement. \\"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\\" In 2010, lung cancer resulting from air pollution killed 223,000 people worldwide, and there was also convincing evidence that it increases the risk of bladder   cancer, according to the IARC. Air pollution is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses, including respiratory and heart diseases. Air pollution is global, although the levels of it vary over space and time. Loomis said people in Asia, eastern North America, some places in Central America and Mexico, as well as North Africa have relatively high exposure.

Question: But corrected figures, provided by the U.S. military and published Tuesday by SIGAR, suggest that the actual decline was 17,980. Pentagon officials acknowledged originally providing inaccurate figures to SIGAR because of a failure \\"to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army,\\" according to a SIGAR statement. According to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018. That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported. \\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\\" the statement added. The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August. Those success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. But the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says. Trump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country. The U.S.-led...

The situation was not as bad as they had previously thought The corrected figures provided by the U.S. military and published by SIGAR (Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction) indicated that the actual decline in the number of Afghan defense forces was 17,980, contrary to the earlier provided inaccurate figures. This discrepancy arose due to a failure to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army.  According to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018, compared to the previously reported total of 296,409. While this still represents a sharp decline in personnel, it is a less drastic decrease than earlier statistics suggested. It is important to note that SIGAR has not been able to independently verify these figures and relies on information provided by USFOR-A (U.S. Forces Afghanistan). Furthermore, SIGAR has been unable to disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed due to classification of that information by Washington and Kabul. It has been reported that Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, with approximately 10,000 personnel lost. Despite these high casualty numbers and ongoing violence, the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August has seen some successes, such as the increased capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. However, the Kabul government only controls just over half of the country's districts, and senior U.S. military officials have acknowledged that the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate. In light of the corrected figures released by the Pentagon, the situation in Afghanistan may not be as dire as previously thought.

Heartbleed bug: RCMP asked Revenue Canada to delay news of SIN thefts The Canada Revenue Agency knew last Friday that hundreds of Canadians had their social insurance numbers stolen from its website because of the Heartbleed security bug but waited until Monday to make it public. \\"The Canada Revenue Agency contacted our office last Friday afternoon to notify us about the attack and of the measures it was taking to mitigate risks and notify affected individuals,\\" said Valerie Lawton, a spokeswoman for the Privacy Commissioner's Office, in a written statement Monday afternoon. The commissioner's office later clarified that it was told by CRA that \\"several hundred Canadians\\" had their social insurance numbers stolen from the agency's website due to the Heartbleed security bug. The CRA publicly confirmed the attack Monday morning. \\"Social insurance numbers (SIN) of approximately 900 taxpayers were removed from CRA systems by someone exploiting the Heartbleed vulnerability,\\" the CRA said in a statement. The Canada Revenue Agency says that 900 social insurance numbers were stolen as a result of the Heartbleed bug. (CBC) But the RCMP said in a statement Tuesday it asked the CRA to delay notifying the public about the breach when the revenue agency referred the matter to the Mounties on Friday. \\"Late Friday afternoon, given that further access to data was no longer possible and that we had identified a viable investigative path, the RCMP asked CRA to delay advising the public of the breach until Monday morning,\\" the statement said. \\"This deferral permitted us to advance our investigation over the weekend, identify possible offender[s] and has helped mitigated further risk.\\" The CRA said it became aware of the breach while repairing the bug, and that the theft happened over a six-hour period — although the agency didn't specify what six-hour period is in question, and isn't offering further explanation beyond a statement posted on its website.​ \\"We are currently going through the painstaking process of analyzing other fragments of data, some that may relate to businesses, that were also removed,\\" the CRA said. The agency said those affected will be contacted via registered letters, and that any attempts to contact a taxpayer via email or telephone are fraudulent. Murray Rankin, the NDP critic for national revenue, says the government has to come clean and tell Canadians exactly what its agencies know. \\"This king of identity theft possibility is frightening to a lot of Canadians and the government has to tell us a lot more than they are telling us,\\" Rankin said in an interview with CBC News. Rankin said the government needs to explain, among other things, why it took the CRA days to repair the vulnerability while some banks were able to fix the problem right away. \\"How is it that our banks can look after security so effectively… whereas the Canada Revenue Agency which has such sensitive information hasn't been able to keep our secrets?\\" Rankin asked. The department of Employment and Social Development Canada told CBC News Monday afternoon that it is working closely with Service Canada and the CRA \\"to ensure all appropriate action is being taken\\" as a result of the breach. \\"The department has taken immediate action to flag the SINs of all affected clients in the Social Insurance Register which will enable ongoing monitoring. This annotation of SIN records requires agents to ask for additional information and photo identification each time there is activity related to an affected SIN,\\" the department said in a written statement. Individuals will be notified \\"if there are any concerns regarding changes made to information on their SIN records,\\" the Department of Employment said. The loss of a social insurance number is among the most serious and dangerous forms of identity theft. \\"Along with other personal information, someone may be able to use your SIN to apply for a credit card or open a bank account, rent vehicles, equipment, or accommodation in your name, leaving you responsible for the bills, charges, bad cheques, and taxes,\\" Canada's privacy commissioner says on its identity theft fact sheet. Anyone affected will be provided with credit protection services at no cost, the revenue agency said. The CRA shut down the public access portion of its website last week, for what it said were precautionary reasons while it implemented a fix to a potential weakness that had been identified. The website was reopened over the weekend, but the CRA alerted police that it had confirmed a breach on Friday. \\"On April 11, 2014, I informed the Privacy Commissioner of Canada of the breach,\\" CRA commissioner Andrew Treusch said. \\"The RCMP are investigating.\\" The Heartbleed bug is caused by a flaw in OpenSSL software, which is commonly used on the internet to provide security and privacy. The bug is affecting many global IT systems in both private- and public-sector organizations, and has the potential to expose private data. Treasury Board officials told CBC News late Monday afternoon that \\"all federal government departments and agencies updated and tested their OpenSSL software and certificates to address this vulnerability. All government of Canada sites with Open SSL are now up and running.\\" \\"We will not provide additional details for operational security reasons,\\" the office of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat told CBC News in an email. Toronto software engineer Justin Bull noticed the vulnerability on the CRA's website ahead of the agency's decision to shut the network down, and Bull says there's a lot we still don't know about the details of this breach. \\"Their lack of information on how the attacker obtained these SIN numbers and how they discovered this was the case, gives a wide area of speculation,\\" Bull said Monday. \\"Chances are, though, since they know 900 SINs were accessed, that the attackers leveraged Heartbleed to gain access to unauthorized section of the website​.\\" Stressing he has no personal knowledge of the situation, web security consultant Raymond Vankrimpen with Richter consultancy in Toronto says it's possible that the 900 affected people may just be those with the bad luck to have logged on before the website was shut down. \\"In that six-hour window between when the bug was disclosed publicly and they shut down their servers … it could have been the 900 people who accessed the server in that window,\\" he said in an interview. It's also possible, however, that the CRA found unauthorized activity by correlating a lot of historical data of \\"normal\\" activity and cross-referencing that to find discrepancies, he says. \\"They would be looking for certain behaviours,\\" he said. \\"A normal person comes to the CRA to file taxes and does X, Y, Z … so they can look at their logs to make a profile, and when they see anomalies they may link that back to unauthorized activity.\\" \\"They're looking for anything out of the normal,\\" Vankrimpen said. \\"I'm not sure how the CRA came up with 900 [but] if there were some nefarious hackers using it to steal info there could still be repercussions to come.\\" \\"We won't see the full fallout for a while,\\" he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Canada Revenue Agency found out that hundreds of Canadians had their social insurance numbers stolen from its website due to the Heartbleed bug. They waited a few days before making it public. The stolen social insurance numbers can be very dangerous because it can lead to identity theft.

No. The given statement, \\"The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized, accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR,\\" is not the correct answer to the question about the number of languages in which students were educated in institutions of higher education in 1974. Considering the question about languages in higher education in 1974, it would not be feasible to provide an exact number of languages in which students were educated worldwide. There are some reasons for the difficulty in determining this figure: 1. Lack of comprehensive data: The year 1974 has limited data availability on higher education across various countries and institutions. There might be some documented cases, but compiling all of this information would be challenging. 2. Language diversity: Institutions of higher education vary greatly based on location and specialization. Education in some countries may have been limited to one or two primary languages, while others may have offered a more diverse range of languages. Providing an exact figure would be an arduous task without a thorough examination of the global higher education landscape during that period. 3. Evolution of languages and courses: The languages and courses offered by institutions have evolved considerably over the last few decades. Some minor languages and dialects used in the past may have been replaced by other more widespread languages, making it difficult to determine the exact number of languages used in the context of 1974. However, it is essential to note that during this time period, several dominant languages were widely used in higher education institutions worldwide. Some of these languages included English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, among others. Many countries adopted these languages either as their official medium of instruction or as part of foreign language programs.

Solve this instance: Question: In which kind of water can less carbon dioxide dissolve? Answer: warm water Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. Here are the supporting facts for the answer: 1. Temperature and solubility: The solubility of gases in water is generally inversely proportional to the temperature of the water. This means that as the temperature of water increases, the solubility of gases like carbon dioxide decreases. 2. Gas molecules and kinetic energy: With an increase in temperature, gas molecules in water gain more kinetic energy and move faster. This leads to a decrease in the interaction between gas molecules and water molecules, making it more difficult for the gas to dissolve in the water. 3. Henry's Law: According to Henry's Law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. At higher temperatures, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreases, resulting in a lower solubility in warm water. 4. Real-world example: The phenomenon of decreased carbon dioxide solubility in warm water can be observed in oceans, where warmer regions have less dissolved carbon dioxide compared to colder regions. This can have significant implications for marine ecosystems and climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz, Cardiac Pioneer, Dies at 90 Although his 1967 transplant was the first in the United States, it was not the first in the world, following by three days Dr. Christiaan Barnard’s in Cape Town. But Dr. Kantrowitz had been methodical in laying the groundwork for the procedure. He practiced hundreds of heart transplants in puppies over the previous four years, and had planned a human operation the previous year, but was prevented at the last minute because the donor infant had not been declared brain-dead. “Although Dr. Kantrowitz had the dedication and perseverance to accomplish this remarkable surgical tour de force, it was the notion that, for the first time, science could view the heart as yet another organ that could be fixed that was a revolutionary concept,” Dr. Stephen J. Lahey, director of cardiothoracic surgery at Maimonides Medical Center, said in a statement on the 40th anniversary of Dr. Kantrowitz’s transplant. While many doctors have worked to replace failing hearts altogether with artificial ones, Dr. Kantrowitz concentrated on finding ways to supplement the work of the natural heart with an impressive array of circulatory devices of his own invention. The most influential was the “left ventricular assist device,” or LVAD, which, for the first time in 1972, allowed a patient with severe chronic heart failure to leave the hospital with a permanent implant. Another of his inventions was the intra-aortic balloon pump, described in The New York Times in 1967 as “a long, narrow gas line” inserted through the patient’s thigh that inflated “a six-inch-long sausage-shaped balloon” in the aorta. The device deflated when the heart pumped blood and inflated when it relaxed, thereby reducing strain on the heart, according to Dr. Kantrowitz’s theory of “counterpulsation.” The device has been used to treat about three million patients since it went into general use in the 1980s. He also invented an early implantable pacemaker, designed with General Electric in 1962, and captured the first film of the mitral valve opening and closing inside a beating heart in 1951. His inventiveness extended beyond cardiology. In 1961, inspired by the way the muscles in the heart were stimulated, he was the first doctor to enable paraplegic patients to move their limbs by electronically triggering their muscles. Adrian Kantrowitz was born on Oct. 4, 1918, in New York City, to a mother who designed costumes for the Ziegfeld Follies and a father who ran a clinic in the Bronx that charged its patients 10 cents a week. “My mother told me from the age of 3 that I wanted to be a doctor,” he told The New York Post in 1966. As a boy he worked with his older brother Arthur to construct an electrocardiograph from old radio parts. The brothers later collaborated on the left ventricular assist device. After graduating from New York University with a degree in mathematics in 1940, Dr. Kantrowitz enrolled in the Long Island College of Medicine (now a part of SUNY Downstate Medical Center) and completed an internship at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. He earned his medical degree early, in 1943, as part of an accelerated program to supply doctors for the war effort. After serving two years as a battalion surgeon in the Army Medical Corps, Dr. Kantrowitz began a career in cardiac research and became a major figure in the first generation of cardiac surgeons. From 1948 to 1955, he practiced surgery at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. From 1955 to 1970, he held surgical posts at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he led a team that devised many influential devices with support from the National Institutes of Health, including an electronic heart-lung machine and a radio transmitter that allowed paralyzed patients to empty their bladders. In 1970 Dr. Kantrowitz left Maimonides when “it became apparent that a small community hospital in Brooklyn was not the proper environment for the development of innovative cardiac surgical techniques,” according to a recent profile in the journal Clinical Cardiology. Remarkably, he was able to move his entire team of 25 surgeons, engineers and nurses — and with them a nearly 3 million research grant — to Detroit, where he taught at Wayne State University School of Medicine and held surgical posts at Sinai Hospital for the rest of his career. Besides his wife, Jean, who helped him start a medical device company, LVAD Technology, in 1983, his survivors include three children, Dr. Niki Kantrowitz, a cardiologist in Brooklyn; Dr. Lisa Kantrowitz, a radiologist in Newport Beach, Calif.; and Dr. Allen Kantrowitz, a neurosurgeon in Williamstown, Mass.; and nine grandchildren. Dr. Kantrowitz received a lifetime achievement award from the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs in 2001. He did not rest on his laurels. This year the Food and Drug Administration approved a clinical trial of his latest cardiac assistance device, which promises to allow seriously ill patients to move around and even exercise.

News article: Attack Victim Charged in Death of a Bystander The indictment, which has not been unsealed, accuses Mr. Parks of second-degree murder, the police said. A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment on why prosecutors pursued a murder charge as opposed to a lesser charge, like manslaughter. Richard Landes, a lawyer representing one of the men charged in connection with the robbery of Mr. Parks, said, “I’m surprised that the grand jury reached this decision.” The Harlem attack was not the first time that Mr. Parks had defended himself with force. Early on Aug. 2, 1994, Mr. Parks shot and wounded a gunman, Marcus Meyers, who tried to rob him in Queens, officials have said. Mr. Parks was charged with attempted murder, officials said, and Mr. Meyers was charged with attempted robbery. No indictments were issued, however, and the cases were sealed. So many details of the incident, like how the gun went off, remain unknown to the public. Shortly after the robbery in January, Mr. Browne said Mr. Parks had taken the written examination to become a police officer three times: in 1992, 1993 and 1999. He was disqualified each time, Mr. Browne said, though he would not disclose the reasons. State Senator Eric L. Adams, a former New York City police officer, visited Mr. Parks days after the incident. The senator said Mr. Parks told him that he had been removed from consideration for the Police Department because of the 1994 shooting. Weeks after the attack in Harlem, with Mr. Parks’s attackers in mind, Mr. Adams proposed legislation named after Mr. Byas that would allow for a person to be charged with murder if, in the commission of a separate crime, an innocent person is killed. On Friday, Mr. Adams said he was still trying to grasp the charges against Mr. Parks. Mr. Parks should be given some leeway for his actions during and in the immediate aftermath of an attack in which he was severely injured, Mr. Adams said, even if, as the police say, he chased Mr. Byas a short distance before stabbing him. “I don’t know if it’s in the spirit of the law to prosecute a victim of a crime,” Mr. Adams, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said by telephone. “If he’s attempting to get away from someone and in the process he mistakes an innocent person to be one of his attackers, I think that should be charged to the person who was attacking him. “Now the people who caused the robbery, they’re going to be charged with a lesser charge than the person who was the victim.” Four men were charged with robbery in the Harlem attack. One pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery last month and is scheduled to be sentenced next month. The other three cases are pending. Mark Weinstein, the lawyer for one of the robbery suspects, Hector Cruz, said, “This man’s arrest makes me feel like I have a great deal more to think about in the case.” Khatib Hasan, a fellow transit worker who has been a friend of Mr. Parks’s for 25 years, said he spoke with Mr. Parks on Wednesday night when he was informed of the indictment. They were both shocked, Mr. Hasan said in a telephone interview. “It’s like getting ambushed again,” said Mr. Hasan, 51. He added that Mr. Parks told him that he still believed that Mr. Byas had been one of the attackers. “Maurice basically told me, ‘When it comes to that good Samaritan, don’t believe the hype,’ ” Mr. Hasan said.

But, one day, a new way of telling this famous music story made some people feel very upset.

This is because there was a time when many people were not nice to each other just because they came from different places or had different beliefs. However, the way Director Kosminski told the story made some people feel bad. They didn't want to watch it anymore, so they started leaving the show after only 30 minutes!

As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC.  Random House was founded in 1925 by Americans Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, two years after they acquired the Modern Library imprint from publisher Horace Liveright, which reprints classic works of literature. Cerf is quoted as saying, \\"We just said we were going to publish a few books on the side at random,\\" which suggested the name Random House. In 1934 they published the first authorized edition of James Joyce's novel \\"Ulysses\\" in the Anglophone world.  In October 1959, Random House went public at 11.25 a share. This move drew other publishing companies, such as Simon & Schuster, to later go public.  Random House entered reference publishing in 1947 with the \\"American College Dictionary\\", which was followed in 1966 by its first unabridged dictionary.  American publishers Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and Pantheon Books were acquired by Random House in 1960 and 1961, respectively; works continue to be published under these imprints with editorial independence, such as Everyman's Library, a series of classical literature reprints.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October.

David collects cigarette packs of different years. He found that two of his packs, pack A and pack B, are very different. Pack A is from before September 2012, and pack B is from after September 2012. He started searching on the internet to find out why the packs were different.  Would pack A's health warning be more or less visible than pack B's? A:","output":"Pack A's health warning would be less visible than Pack B's health warning. This is due to changes in regulations for cigarette packaging that occurred during this period. In September 2012, the European Union adopted the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which aimed to improve the functioning of the internal market for tobacco and related products, while ensuring a high level of health protection for European citizens. One of the key components of this directive was to increase the size and prominence of health warnings on cigarette packs. As a result, cigarette packs produced after September 2012 (Pack B) are required to have larger, more visible health warnings compared to those produced before September 2012 (Pack A). The TPD required that cigarette packs display combined health warnings, which include both a text warning and a color photograph, covering 65% of the front and back of the packaging. This requirement was implemented in May 2016. Before the implementation of the TPD, health warnings typically covered a smaller portion of the cigarette pack. In addition to larger health warnings, cigarette packs after September 2012 also include more specific and graphic images and text, further increasing the visibility and impact of the warnings. Overall, Pack B's health warning would be more visible and impactful than Pack A's health warning due to these regulatory changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who are you and what is your relationship to the person you are writing for? How long have you known the person in question? How much time do you spend together? Where did you meet? Readers of a character reference letter want to know exactly what kind of relationship the writer has to the individual for whom they’re vouching. Spend time thinking about the nature of your relationship to the individual in question. Be detailed. Instead of saying, “I’ve known Tom for three years,” say instead, “I have had the pleasure of working alongside Tom for the past three years at Yum Yum Burgers in Paytonville, Ohio.” Character references should follow a three-part format consisting of an opening introductory paragraph in which you describe who you are and your relationship to the person on whose behalf you’re writing; a second paragraph in which you lay out your analysis of the person’s character; and a closing paragraph in which you beseech the reader to look favorably upon the individual who you’re writing about.  Close the reference letter by urging the reader to look favorably upon the subject of the letter. Sign it “Sincerely, [your name].” Keep the character reference letter short. The readers don't need page after page of information on a character reference. They need the basics. Keep this in mind when penning a rough draft for your character reference. A character reference letter is not a venue for carefully comparing the good and bad parts of a person's personality, background or lifestyle. It should, instead, be aimed at providing an honest but upbeat assessment of the individual’s accomplishments, goals, and personality. A successful character reference will leave the reader with a positive impression of the individual in question.  Use positive adjectives in order to stress what a good person your subject is.  List, briefly, the relevant accomplishments for the person about whom the reference is being written. For instance, if the individual has donated to philanthropic causes with either time or money, mention as much in your letter. If they have a military background and served with honor, cite their acts of bravery or courage in order to minimize a harsh legal penalty. List also any contributions the individual makes to their church or fraternal organization. If you find yourself wondering whether or not to put a certain accomplishment in, ask yourself, \\"Is this relevant or does it show good traits?\\" Before submitting your letter, give it a once-over to catch any spelling, punctuation or grammar mistakes. New word processing technology makes this task easier for those who are not great writers. Check any words which are underlined with a red squiggly line; unless they are names, they are likely misspelled. In addition to spelling and grammar, ensure your facts are correct.  Submit a draft copy to the person on whose behalf you’re writing in order to ensure everything is correct.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: My mother-in-law, Dorothy, is showing me the red notebook that's almost as precious to her as my husband's baby pictures. Inside the notebook is a list of the books she has read since 2007. For some people waking up in the middle of the night is a terrible thing. But for my mother-in-law, that time is a gift. At 87, she is getting the education she never had by working her way through great literature. She has now read close to 100 books, including every single novel by Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Henry James and Thomas Mann. My mother-in-law discusses her passion with the enthusiasm of a young girl, although she can also be a very tough critic, writing \\"VG' for \\" very good\\" in the margins next to her favorites. So far, only a handful of books have received the top prize. Born in Ridgefield, Conn, Dorothy was the youngest daughter of an Italian gardener. She taught herself English by reading The New York Times. Eager to come to Manhattan, she became a nurse, married a dentist and spent the next several decades keeping the house and raising a family. In her later years, she put her nursing skills to good use by taking care of my father-in-law, who had lung cancer. There were many trips to the emergency room in the middle of the night and then a long hospital stay. She stayed awake to watch over him for 15 hours a day. Always a light sleeper, she developed sleeplessness as a result of the stress. It worsened after he died. Deeply sad and lonely for the first time in her life, she began waking up around 2am. Julian and Sylvia, the elderly couple next door suggest she read literature. And so Julian, a great lover of literature, became her \\"professor\\", providing books from his large library.

Plot title: The Amazing Spider-Man Movie plot: Scientist Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) is playing hide-and-seek with his young son Peter (Max Charles) when he discovers that his study has been broken into. After quickly gathering some hidden documents, Richard and his wife Mary (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), then mysteriously depart without telling Peter where they are going.Years later, the teenage Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) has become an alienated social outcast. He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \\"biocable\\" is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash. Uncle Ben is forced to switch a work shift to meet with the principal about the situation. Afterward, Uncle Ben asks Peter to pick up Aunt May, but Peter... My question: What does Spider-Man suspect Connor is? A:","output":"In \\"The Amazing Spider-Man,\\" Peter Parker (Spider-Man) suspects Dr. Curtis Connors of being involved in dangerous experiments related to cross-species genetics, which could potentially pose a threat to the public. His suspicions are fueled by the discovery of his father's old documents, which reveal that Richard Parker and Dr. Connors were researching cross-species genetics together. Moreover, Peter's encounter with genetically-modified spiders at Oscorp and his own transformation after being bitten by one of these spiders further consolidates his suspicion of Dr. Connors. After visiting Dr. Connors and giving him the documents, Peter learns about Dr. Connors' frustration with Dr. Ratha and the pressure to find a cure for Norman Osborn. These circumstances lead Peter to suspect that Dr. Connors could potentially turn to unethical or dangerous methods in his desperation to find a solution. As the story unfolds, Peter's suspicions are confirmed when Dr. Connors injects himself with an experimental serum in an attempt to regenerate his lost arm. This causes him to transform into the monstrous Lizard, creating chaos and posing a significant threat to the people of New York City. Spider-Man then faces the challenge of stopping the Lizard and saving the city, while also trying to save Dr. Connors from the consequences of his actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The star burns until it runs out of fuel - The star can no longer support its weight - The layers of hydrogen press down on the core - The core gets smaller and smaller under the pressure - The pressure causes gravity to get stronger - The gravity becomes so powerful that nothing can escape it - Anything that gets close to it, is drawn into it by its gravity - Light is drawn into it - Light can not escape - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the given process is the formation of a massive star. The detailed process with the missing first step included is as follows: 1. Formation of a massive star: The first step in the process is the formation of a massive star. Stars are formed within clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae, which are located throughout galaxies. Through gravitational attraction, the gas and dust start to clump together, forming a dense region known as a protostar. As the protostar continues to accumulate mass, its core becomes increasingly dense and hot. Once the core reaches a high enough temperature and pressure, nuclear fusion begins, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing energy in the form of radiation. This marks the transition from a protostar to a main-sequence star. 2. The star burns until it runs out of fuel: During its main-sequence phase, the star remains in a stable state, with its internal pressure and gravity balancing each other. This stage can last billions of years, depending on the mass of the star. Ultimately, though, the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel and can no longer maintain the fusion process. 3. The star can no longer support its weight: As the hydrogen fuel is depleted, the star's core contracts, and the remaining outer layers expand due to the increased temperature. This causes the star to transform into a red giant. 4. The layers of hydrogen press down on the core: With the star's core contracting, the outer hydrogen layers start pressing down on it. 5. The core gets smaller and smaller under the pressure: The pressure exerted by the outer layers causes the core to shrink further, increasing its temperature and density. 6. The pressure causes gravity to get stronger: Due to the increased density and smaller size, the gravitational force acting on the core becomes stronger. 7. The gravity becomes so powerful that nothing can escape it: Eventually, the gravitational force becomes so strong that it overcomes the outward pressure from the core. When this happens, the core collapses under its own gravity, resulting in an explosion called a supernova. 8. Anything that gets close to it is drawn into it by its gravity: The remnants of the core that are left behind after the supernova form a dense region in space called a neutron star or, if the original star was large enough, a black hole. In the case of a black hole, the gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape from it. 9. Light is drawn into it: If the remnant becomes a black hole, its gravitational pull is so powerful that it bends light towards it, trapping it within its event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole's gravity. 10. Light cannot escape: Once light or any other form of radiation or matter crosses the event horizon, it is lost forever within the black hole, as escape requires an infinite amount of energy. In summary, the missing first step in the given process is the formation of a massive star from a nebula, which eventually leads to the birth of a black hole when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel and undergoes a supernova explosion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.

Formed in 1987, they are one of the most popular acts signed to UK electronic label Warp Records, through which all of Autechre's full-length albums have been released beginning in 1993 with Incunabula. They have also worked closely with the label Skam. The music of Autechre has shifted gradually throughout their career, from their earlier work's roots in techno, electro, and hip hop to later albums often considered experimental in nature, featuring complex drum programming, subdued melodies, and few stylistic conventions. Their ninth album, Quaristice, was released in early 2008. In contrast to Untilted, it is made up of twenty tracks, more than any other Autechre release, each typically around 2-5 minutes in length. The download-only Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae EP that accompanies it (as well as the Versions bonus disc and three tracks released exclusively through the Japanese iTunes Store) brings the total length of music released during their Quaristice era to over five hours. Among this is the hour-long \\"Perlence subrange 6-36\\" that closes the EP. Each track on Quaristice was edited down from lengthy improvised sessions between Booth and Brown, some of which were released in longer versions on Quaristice. Quadrange.ep.ae. Although Sean Booth has stated that the FLAC release of Quaristice is the actual product, the album was also released by Warp Records as a double LP and a single CD as well as an elaborate two CD edition by Warp Records. Limited to only 1000 copies, and containing both the regular album and Quaristice (Versions), this special edition was packaged in a photo-etched steel case. It sold out within 12 hours of being announced.  On 13 January 2010, Warp Records announced Oversteps, Autechre's tenth album. Originally slated to be released in March, it was released a month early in digital form on Bleep.com to those who preordered it; the CD and deluxe vinyl editions were released on 22 March 2010. A two-month European tour occurred in support of the album, followed by limited shows in Japan and Australia, the latter breaking a 15-year absence. Autechre then compiled a mix for the magazine FACT, released in February of the same year, that consisted of tracks by artists such as J Dilla and Necrophagist. On 25 May 2010, Warp Records announced the ten track Move of Ten, an EP by the duo in conjunction with the release of Oversteps. The digipack CD and the two 12\\" vinyl version, as well as a digital download, was released on 12 July 2010.  In April 2011 a boxset of EPs entitled EPs 1991 - 2002 (excluding Move of Ten) was released, with artwork from the Designers Republic. It includes a CD copy of their debut EP, Cavity Job, the first time it has been released on the format. In 2011 as part of Warp's 'Made in Japan' relief concert for the victims of the 2011 Sendai earthquake, an eleven-minute piece was released entitled '6852', possibly part of a previous live recording.

Given the question: If aplanet accelerates because of gravity, then what causes a planet to accelerate?  Answer choices: - other planets  - magnets  - wind  - gravitational pull  - flow of electrons  - It gets heated up  - heat energy  - energy of moving objects The answer is:","output":"The primary cause of a planet's acceleration is gravitational pull. Specifically, this refers to the gravitational forces exerted by larger celestial bodies, such as stars, as well as other planets and their moons, all of which can impact a planet's acceleration. Gravitational forces are a fundamental aspect of our universe, as they dictate the motion and behavior of virtually all celestial objects. Sir Isaac Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation outlines the interaction between two masses, stating that the gravitational force between them is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In the context of planetary motion, the most significant instance of gravitational pull is the force exerted by a star, like the Sun in our solar system, on the planets orbiting it. This force not only causes the planets to accelerate but also maintains their orbital paths, preventing them from drifting away into space or being pulled into the star. Additionally, the gravitational interactions between planets, known as interplanetary gravitational forces, can also influence the acceleration of planets. In some cases, these forces can cause perturbations or variations in a planet's orbital path, which can, in turn, affect its acceleration. The same principle applies to the gravitational pull between a planet and its moons. Though not impacting a planet's acceleration, some of the other factors mentioned, such as heat energy, magnets, and flow of electrons, can affect various phenomena on a planet's surface. For instance, heat energy is responsible for driving volcanic activity, while flow of electrons in a planet's core can contribute to its magnetic field. However, these factors do not directly cause a planet to accelerate in the context of its motion in space. In conclusion, among the answer choices provided, gravitational pull is the primary cause of a planet's acceleration. The gravitational forces between celestial bodies, such as stars, other planets, and moons, directly influence a planet's motion and acceleration in space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the point where the two ends of the metal loop meet, allowing for insertion or removal of keys. 2. With the staple remover in my hand, I would grip the key ring using the teeth of the staple remover, making sure to insert one tooth inside the loop and the other tooth outside, positioned near the split or opening of the ring. The wide end of the staple remover, where the teeth originate, should be held in my fingers, while the slender tips of the teeth surround the key ring. 3. After gripping the key ring securely with the staple remover, I will apply gentle pressure on the handles, causing the teeth of the staple remover to separate. This action will force the key ring to pry open, creating a gap wide enough to insert the key. 4. With the key ring held open by the staple remover, I can then insert the key's hole onto the ring with my other hand. I am choosing this option because it provides better control and precision, making it easier to slip the key onto the key ring without risking injury from the prying action. 5. Once the key is securely on the key ring, I can carefully release the pressure on the staple remover handles, allowing the key ring to close back to its original position. 6.

Secretary of State Colin Powell last week ruled out a non-aggression treaty .","output":"No, the two sentences do not convey the exact same meaning, although they share some similar elements. Each sentence can be closely examined to understand the subtle differences between them. 1. \\"But Secretary of State Colin Powell brushed off this possibility Wednesday.\\" In this sentence, \\"brushed off\\" implies that Secretary of State Colin Powell casually dismissed or rejected an idea, which, in this context, seems to be the \\"possibility\\" of some action or outcome. The mention of \\"Wednesday\\" denotes that this event took place on a specific day of the week. 2. \\"Secretary of State Colin Powell last week ruled out a non-aggression treaty.\\" In this sentence, \\"ruled out\\" suggests a stronger, more definitive decision by Secretary of State Colin Powell to eliminate the option of entering into a non-aggression treaty. In contrast with the casual dismissal in the first sentence, this sentence conveys a conscious and resolute decision not to consider the treaty. By stating \\"last week,\\" the sentence places the event in a broader timeframe relative to the specific day mentioned in the first sentence. In summary, while both sentences involve Secretary of State Colin Powell rejecting or dismissing something, the first sentence portrays a casual dismissal of a possibility without specifying the subject, while the second sentence depicts a more definitive and deliberate ruling out of a specific course of action – a non-aggression treaty. Additionally, the first sentence takes place on a specific day, while the second sentence refers to an event happening at some point in the previous week."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces Answer:","output":"The final step of the process in which a plant grows near or on a rock, its roots expand and break apart the rock, plant acids dissolve parts of the rock, and the rocks break into smaller and smaller pieces, is the formation of soil and nutrient cycling. This step completes the transformation and plays an essential role in the ecosystem. Here is a detailed explanation of this final step: 1. Formation of soil: As the plant roots cause mechanical weathering, breaking apart the rock, and plant acids dissolve parts of the rock through chemical weathering, the resulting fragmented and weathered rock materials mix with the plant's organic matter, such as decomposed leaves, stems, and other plant parts. Over time, the combination of these mineral and organic materials forms soil. Soil is crucial for plant growth and development, as it provides them with nutrients, water, and anchorage. 2. Nutrient cycling: The soil formed from the weathered rocks contains essential minerals and nutrients that are necessary for plant growth. As plants absorb these nutrients from the soil, they become part of the plant biomass. When plants age, their leaves, stems, and other parts fall to the ground and begin to decompose. Decomposition is primarily facilitated by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, as well as macroorganisms like earthworms and insects. During decomposition, the organic matter is broken down into its base components, releasing the nutrients back into the soil in a form that can be assimilated by other plants and organisms. This process, called nutrient cycling, ensures that the ecosystem remains healthy and sustainable over time by providing a continuous supply of essential nutrients to support plant growth and productivity. 3. Habitat provision and ecosystem dynamics: As plants continue to grow on and around the weathered rocks and nutrient-rich soil, they provide a habitat for various organisms, such as insects, birds, and small mammals. These organisms also contribute to nutrient cycling by consuming organic matter and producing waste, which is decomposed back into the soil. The interactions between these plants and organisms create a dynamic and biodiverse ecosystem that relies on the continuous process of rock weathering, soil formation, and nutrient cycling to sustain it. In conclusion, the final step of the process involving plant growth on rocks, roots expansion, rock dissolution, and fragmentation is the formation of soil and nutrient cycling. This step is pivotal in supporting plant life, maintaining ecosystem balance, and promoting biodiversity in the environment. The interactions among plants, rocks, and organisms highlight the importance of understanding Earth's natural processes and how they shape the world around us for sustainable ecosystem function and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pohl-Stroher was born on 18 January 1919 in Wurzen in Saxony , East Germany and grew up in Rothenkirchen in Vogtland .","output":"The two sentences from Wikipedia have nearly the same meaning but with a slight difference in geographical detail. Both sentences convey the same information about Pohl-Stroher's date of birth, which is 18 January 1919, as well as the major information regarding the locations of Wurzen in Saxony and Rothenkirchen. However, the distinction lies in the specification of the regions of Vogtland and East Germany. In the first sentence, Pohl-Stroher was born in Wurzen, situated in Saxony, and more specifically in Vogtland, which is a region within Saxony. Pohl-Stroher then grew up in Rothenkirchen in East Germany. The focus of this sentence is to highlight Saxony as part of Vogtland, without specifying whether Rothenkirchen is placed within Vogtland or not. On the other hand, the second sentence claims that Pohl-Stroher was born in Wurzen, located in Saxony, and more specifically in East Germany. Pohl-Stroher grew up in Rothenkirchen, situated within the Vogtland region. The main point of this sentence is to emphasize Rothenkirchen's location in Vogtland, without providing any particular detail about the position of Wurzen within Vogtland or somewhere else in Saxony. In summary, both sentences deliver almost the same meaning, with just a slight difference regarding the regions in which Wurzen and Rothenkirchen are situated.

News article: A review of commercial satellite imagery from 2010 until the present covering North Korea’s submarine bases and building shipyards has revealed the presence of a previously unidentified submarine moored in the secured boat basin at the Sinpo South Shipyard. This shipyard, also known by the cover designation “Pongdae Boiler Plant,” is the primary manufacturing facility for North Korea’s submarines and the headquarters of the Maritime Research Institute of the Academy of the National Defense Science. The institute is responsible for research and development of maritime technology, naval vessels and submarines, and naval related armaments and missiles.[1]      The newly identified submarine has a length of approximately 67 meters and a beam of 6.6 meters, possesses a rounded bow, a conning tower located amidships, and no visible diving planes.[2] These dimensions suggest a dived displacement in the 900-1,500 ton range. Visible in the image are mooring lines, people moving about and equipment stored on the pier adjacent to the submarine. The long object on the pier forward of the conning tower is likely a line of closely packed shipping crates or equipment and not a missile tube, as the overall measurements are approximately 8.4 meters long and .65 meters wide. A blue tarp is covering the stern portion of the top of the sail. No torpedo or missile tubes are readily discernable on the bow or deck of the submarine in any of the available imagery.      Figure 1. A July 24, 2014 image of the Sinpo South Shipyard (Pongdae Boiler Plant) on North Korea’s east coast shows the newly identified submarine berthed within the facility’s secure boat basin.      The origins of this submarine are unclear. While the boat bears a superficial resemblance to the Russian KILO or LADA class patrol submarines—it lacks the teardrop hull-shape of the former and the conning tower mounted diving planes of the later.[3] Additional research shows, however, a close resemblance in size and shape to the former Yugoslavian SAVA and HEROJ class submarines.[4] A Yugoslavian origin for the design would not be unusual since the North Koreans acquired a number of submarine designs from that nation during the 1970s and used them as the basis for several experimental designs as well as the yugo class of midget submarines.

An August 16, 2014 image of the newly identified submarine showing that it has moved during the previous month.      It is interesting to note that in October 1996 Yi Kwang Su, the captured helmsman from the sang-o class submarine that grounded itself at Kangnung, South Korea, that September stated, “a 1,000 ton submarine is now under construction at Pongdae Boiler Plant in Sinpo on the east coast.”[6] While it is unlikely the boat described by Yi would be the submarine identified at Sinpo, the correlation of locations and displacements is intriguing.      It is too early to identify the missions intended for this new class of submarine or the position it could occupy in the Korean People’s Navy’s future submarine forces. If the design is successful and enters production as a patrol submarine (SS), the new boat will have greater range, patrol time and weapons capability than the existing KPN fleet of SANG-O and SANG-O II class coastal submarines. It could also potentially replace the existing inventory of Type 033 ROMEO patrol submarines. It is unclear at this point whether the new submarine, if deployed in sufficient numbers, would represent a possible shift in KPN strategy from coastal defense towards a more offensive anti-ship operations. However, it is possible that this boat is simply a one-off experimental submarine (SSA) intended to validate certain design parameters and equipment, as the KPN has done this on occasion in the past. It, however, does not presently appear to be designed as a test bed for a submarine launched ballistic missile.      Joseph S.

[6] “Infiltrator, Defector News Conference,” Yonhap, October 29, 1996. ||||| Looks like North Korea's engineers have been hard at work brushing up on their obsolete Soviet-era technology. Because after acquiring 10 discontinued Soviet subs, everyone's favorite little warmongering-dictatorship-that-could has finally rendered the outdated ballistic vessels seaworthy—and it only took them 21 years.      According to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, the submarines were actually first built in 1958, when the Soviet Union began developing Golf-class diesel-electric subs under the name Project 629. Overall, each individual sub was made to carry three liquid-propellant ballistic missiles, one nuclear warhead, and six torpedo tubes.      Advertisement      The subs were actually decommissioned in 1990, a year before the Soviet Union first fell; then in 1993, about ten were allegedly sold to North Korea. Of course, even 20 years later, the hermit country still has a bit of a ways to go. According to Yonhap:      In a move to mount a missile tube on the new vessel, the communist country has carried out dozens of tests both on the ground and at sea, another source said. \\"According to the analysis of satellite imagery revealed by 38 North, a ground test facility for the SLBM launch has been up and running at the Sinpo shipyard,\\" he said, adding a dozen more tests would be required to perfect the technology. \\"It would take one or two years before the North completes the test for the vertical launch of missiles from the sea,\\" said a military source in Seoul, expressing security concerns as Pyongyang has also been working on miniaturizing nuclear warheads for its missiles.      Not to mention the fact that equipping a submarine with ballistic missiles would require Kim Jong-Un to trust the vessel's captain to make deployment calls, requiring the sort of autonomy practically unheard in North Korean affairs.      Advertisement      So while the addition of submarine-launched ballistics missile would certainly give North Korea some disconcerting leverage in nuclear talks, the 50-some-odd-year-old tech still isn't quite there yet. [Yonhap via RT]      Image via KCNA ||||| North Korea remains years away from being able to launch ballistic missiles from a submarine even as its leader Kim Jong Un seeks to expand the fleet’s range and firepower, weapons analysts said.      “If the North decides to pursue such a capability, it is likely to take years to design, develop, manufacture, and deploy an operational submarine-launched ballistic missile force,” Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., chief analytical officer at AllSource Analysis, wrote last week on 38 North, a blog run by the U.S.- Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.      A North Korean submarine with working missile silos would mark a giant stride in Kim’s ability to threaten distant rivals, including the U.S., as his regime claims it can now make warheads small enough to be deployed on missiles.      The U.S. and South Korea remain vigilant on North Korean submarines among an array of threats the country poses, Kwon Ki Hyun, a spokesman for Seoul’s Defense Ministry, said today by phone. He declined to confirm a Yonhap News report yesterday that the North modified a Soviet-era diesel submarine to build its own vessel that could eventually be capable of firing ballistic missiles. Yonhap cited an unidentified South Korean government official.      Nuclear Tests      North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006, has been trying to modify Soviet-era submarines so they can be used to launch SSN6 missiles, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said in September. He said then that the North hadn’t yet succeeded in making its subs capable of firing missiles.      “The North Koreans are poor, but not stupid, and they do have some pretty good engineers, especially in weapons areas,” Dean Cheng, who specializes in military capabilities as a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said in an e-mail. “But modifying a submarine is no mean feat, and would take a lot of time and be risky, especially as it would require compromising the hull’s integrity and would likely make a fairly noisy boat even noisier.”      North Korea has built a test pad in its eastern coastal city of Sinpo that is “probably intended to explore the possibility of launching ballistic missiles from submarines or of a shipboard vertical launch ballistic missile capability,” Bermudez wrote, citing commercial DigitalGlobe images from July.      Warship Torpedoed      North Korea has 1.2 million troops and operates about 70 submarines, while the South has 10 of the vessels, according to a 2012 South Korean defense white paper. South Korea accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships in 2010, resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors, a charge the North denies.      In June, North Korea released photos of Kim boarding a submarine during drills. He has also stepped up efforts to expand his regime’s missile arsenal, personally overseeing the launch of “ultra-precision” guided missiles in June. North Korea is banned from developing ballistic missiles under sanctions imposed by the United Nations for nuclear testing.      Putting ballistic missiles on submarines may also limit Kim’s ability to control the weapons, Bermudez said.      “It also assumes that Pyongyang would entrust an operational nuclear-armed missile to the captain of a submarine who would, in time of war, most likely be out of communication with the leadership,” he said.      Atomic Bombs      North Korea may have made “considerable” progress in miniaturizing its atomic bombs, South Korean Defense Minister Han Min Koo said today at a parliamentary hearing. Army General Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, said last month that the North may now be able to miniaturize a nuclear weapon to fit on a mobile missile warhead that could hit parts of the U.S.      While Kim hasn’t yet deployed a ballistic missile that could hit the mainland U.S., “he’s showing us the signs that he’s trying to get there,” Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of U.S. forces in the Pacific, said in a Bloomberg Government interview in September.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose death at the height of her fame and was a shock to the musical world? from the following article ?  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their devastating Sunday Night loss to the Cardinals, the Vikings went home and met the Cincinnati Bengals in a Week 14 duel. After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16-7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run. With the win, the Vikings not only improved to 11-2 on the season, they also secured a playoff berth for the second consecutive season and improved upon the record from the previous season (10-6). Their \\"magic number\\" decreased to one, meaning that either a Green Bay loss at Pittsburgh or a Vikings win against Carolina on Sunday night would make Minnesota repeat division champions for the first time since 1978, when they won six consecutive NFC Central titles. Also, if the Eagles lost against San Francisco, the Vikings would also clinch a first-round bye in the NFC playoffs.

If you want to cover vitiligo patches, regular department store make-up won't cut it. You'll need to buy specialized make-up designed to cover discolorations caused by vitiligo, referred to as camouflage or cover make-up.","output":"Once you have selected the appropriate cover or camouflage make-up designed for vitiligo, follow these steps to effectively cover your vitiligo patches: 1. Cleanse and moisturize your skin: It's crucial to start with a clean and hydrated canvas, so begin by washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Once your face is clean, apply a layer of moisturizer to keep your skin well-hydrated. This will also help the make-up to go on more smoothly and evenly. 2. Choose the right shade of make-up: The importance of selecting the correct shade that matches your natural skin tone cannot be overstated. Test a small amount of the make-up on a patch of healthy skin next to the vitiligo patch to ensure the color blends seamlessly. Sometimes, mixing two or more shades can help you achieve a more accurate match. 3. Apply a primer: Once the moisturizer has fully absorbed into your skin, apply a make-up primer. Primers create a smooth base, allow the make-up to stay on longer, and can also help to minimize the appearance of pores. Opt for a color-correcting primer if the vitiligo patches have a distinct undertone, like green to neutralize reddish tones or yellow to counter bluish tones. 4. Apply the camouflage make-up: Using a small, clean sponge, brush, or your fingertips, gently dab the make-up onto the vitiligo patch. Start at the center and work outward in small circular motions, ensuring that all edges are well-blended to avoid any obvious demarcation lines. Take your time and be patient to achieve a natural, even coverage.  5. Layer and set: To increase the coverage, allow the initial layer of make-up to dry before applying additional thin layers. Avoid applying too much make-up at once, as it can end up looking cakey or unnatural. Once you're satisfied with the coverage, set the make-up in place using a translucent setting powder. Lightly dust the powder over the area, taking care not to disturb the make-up underneath. 6. Apply the rest of your make-up: After your vitiligo patches have been effectively covered, you can proceed with your regular make-up routine. Apply foundation to the rest of your face and blend it well with the camouflage make-up, ensuring there are no noticeable lines or uneven patches. Finish your look with your favorite eye make-up, lipstick, or blush. 7. Consider waterproof alternatives: If you're worried about the make-up wearing off due to sweat or water, look for waterproof cover make-up formulations or apply a waterproof setting spray to help seal the make-up in place. 8. Practice and patience: Learning to cover vitiligo patches effectively with make-up can take some time and practice. Do not be discouraged if it doesn't look perfect on your first try. With more experience, you'll become more skilled at achieving a natural and flawless coverage. Don't forget that it's crucial to remove your make-up thoroughly at the end of the day using a gentle cleanser and moisturize your skin to keep it healthy and nourished. Investing in high-quality skincare products specifically formulated for sensitive skin can also benefit those with vitiligo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S.  Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church.  David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes.  Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion.  In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members.  By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.  By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \\"enormous success\\".In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War.

What is the answer?","output":"The famed science fiction writer who celebrates an August birthday and is best known for his dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451 and The Martian Chronicles is Ray Bradbury. Ray Douglas Bradbury was born on August 22, 1920, in Waukegan, Illinois, and passed away on June 5, 2012, in Los Angeles, California. He is considered one of the most influential and celebrated science fiction authors of the 20th century. Ray Bradbury began his writing career at a young age, and he rose to fame with his short stories initially published in science fiction magazines. He was recognized for his creativity, imagination, and exploration of diverse themes, including the effects of technology on society, the importance of literature, and the power of imagination. Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953, is one of Bradbury's most famous novels. It is set in a dystopian society that sees literature and books as a threat, and therefore, firemen are tasked with burning books rather than putting out fires. The novel follows the protagonist, Guy Montag, a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his work and, with the help of a few like-minded individuals, fights against the oppressive regime. The story tackles themes such as censorship, the power of literature, and the decay of human values in a society dominated by technology and a relentless pursuit of happiness. The Martian Chronicles, published in 1950, is a collection of interconnected short stories that depict the colonization of Mars by humans who have fled a decaying Earth. The stories explore themes such as the impact of colonization on indigenous populations, humanity's desire for escapism and a fresh start, and the consequences of technology and nuclear war. The Martian Chronicles is lauded for its poetic prose and imaginative storytelling, examining humanity's relationship with nature, technology, and the future. In addition to these renowned works, Ray Bradbury authored hundreds of short stories, novels, plays, essays, and screenplays throughout his illustrious career. Some of his other well-known works include \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" (1962), \\"The Illustrated Man\\" (1951), and \\"Dandelion Wine\\" (1957). He has received numerous awards and honors for his literary contributions, including the National Medal of Arts in 2004, the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1989, and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1977."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Final Cut' signifies the completion of a film, encapsulating the plot twist that the whole series of events is being filmed by a small college crew. It is a phrase familiar to everyone associated with movie production, making it deeply symbolic to the plot as a whole. 'Turbulence' in the title is a double entendre referring to both the literal turbulence of the plane travelling through a storm, as well as metaphorically indicating the chaos ensuing as the flight attendants turn killers and the students are killed. 'Tales' signifies the stories or urban legends that are being explored in the movie, which is pivotal as the main character's, Amy, personal narrative about her ambition to be a filmmaker blends with the urban legend narrative. The title also summons intrigue and curiosity, prompting the audience to wonder about the specifics of these 'tales' and the scope of the 'final cut'. The audience may wonder who is behind the 'cut', what is 'final' about it, and how 'turbulence' is involved, drawing them into the narrative and its development. It reflects the genre, context, and intense plot of the movie, thereby providing a fitting title. Additionally, the 'Final Cut' also resonates in the context of the Hitchcock Film Award as hinted in the plot. The title creates an ironic twist as the story that starts as a film within a film evolves into a nightmare, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. It becomes clear that the 'Turbulence Tales' are not just confined to the screen, but spill over into the real world with deadly consequences. This also correlates with Amy, who in her pursuit to make a film about urban legends, finds herself living one. To sum up, \\"Final Cut: Turbulence Tales\\" is quite suitable as a movie title given its multi-layered implications that neatly tie up with the plot, the movie-making context, and the suspense it generates - very much in line with the thriller/horror vibes of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Had it forever now all the sudden it stopped working\\" A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the review, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. The reason for this rating is as follows: 1. Length and Detail: The review is quite brief and lacks sufficient details to provide a comprehensive understanding of the customer's experience. It does not mention the specific product or service, nor does it provide context about how long \\"forever\\" might be in the context of the product's expected lifespan. Furthermore, it does not describe the nature of the issue, the circumstances that led to it, or any attempts to resolve the problem. This makes it difficult for readers to determine whether the issue encountered by the reviewer is a common problem or an isolated incident. 2. Objectivity: The review seems to be focusing on a negative aspect only (the product's sudden failure) without mentioning any positive aspects or experiences with the product. This might give potential customers an imbalanced view of the product's overall quality and performance. However, it would be more effective if the reviewer had provided a broader perspective on their overall experience with the product. 3. Structure and Clarity: The review is written in a casual, conversational tone, which can be easy for readers to understand. However, the lack of punctuation and capitalization makes it harder to decipher the message and might give an impression of unprofessionalism or low credibility. Improving the structure would have increased its clarity and made it easier for readers to interpret the review's meaning. 4. Constructive Feedback: The review lacks specific suggestions for product improvement or information about whether the manufacturer or seller was contacted to address the problem. This diminishes the review's effectiveness in guiding other consumers and helping the manufacturer/seller make improvements. 5. Relevance: The review might be relevant to other potential customers who are considering purchasing the product and want to learn about its durability. However, because of the lack of detail and context mentioned earlier, it may not be as helpful as it could be in enabling readers to make informed decisions. In summary, despite having some relevance for potential buyers, the review's brevity, lack of detail, and focus on a negative aspect without balancing it with positive experiences limit its usefulness. By addressing these shortcomings, the reviewer could provide a more accurate and informative assessment of the product, ultimately leading to a higher rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What would imply that a tree was growing during cold seasons?\\" is in \\"If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The passage you provided gives insight into the characteristics of different types of wood and how the growth rings appear in them. The answer to the question, \\"What would imply that a tree was growing during cold seasons?\\" can be found in the explanation of how distinct growth rings are formed. In the passage, it is mentioned that a heavier piece of pine with a larger proportion of latewood has more clearly demarcated growth rings than a lightweight piece. This is because latewood is denser and its deeper color presents a contrast to the lighter, straw-colored earlywood. This distinction between earlywood and latewood is more prominent in hard pines than in white pines. So, when examining a tree's growth rings, if you observe clear and distinct demarcations between the dense, dark-colored latewood and the softer, lighter-colored earlywood, you can infer that the tree was growing even during cold seasons. This is because these distinct boundaries between latewood and earlywood signify that the tree has gone through different seasons of growth, where the latewood corresponds to the slower growth during the cold seasons and earlywood to the faster growth in warmer seasons. In conclusion, the clear demarcation of growth rings, as seen through the contrast of dense latewood and soft earlywood, implies that a tree was growing during cold seasons as it indicates a variation in growth rate throughout different seasons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"All Negro Comics was an American comic book series created in 1947, which holds great historical significance for being the first known comic book written and drawn exclusively by African American writers and artists. This groundbreaking publication aimed to challenge the racial stereotypes and prejudices that were prevalent in the mainstream comic industry during the mid-20th century. The mastermind behind All Negro Comics was Orrin Cromwell Evans, a visionary journalist and civil rights activist who sought to provide a strong, positive representation of Black characters within comic books. Orrin Cromwell Evans was a prominent journalist and a pioneer in the African American press. He had extensive experience working for Black-owned newspapers, such as the Philadelphia Tribune and the Pittsburgh Courier. Inspired by the need for representation and the powerful medium of comic books, Evans decided to create All Negro Comics Inc., which would publish comic books by and for African Americans. Collaborating with a team of talented African American writers and artists, including his brother George J. Evans Jr. (letterer), John Terrell (artist), and Bill Driskell (inker), Evans published the first and only issue of All Negro Comics in June 1947. Due to its historical significance, this singular issue has become a valuable collector's item in the comic book industry. All Negro Comics featured a diverse range of stories and characters designed to appeal to various readers: 1. \\"Ace Harlem\\" - Written and drawn by John Terrell, this was the lead story of the comic book, featuring Ace Harlem, a skilled African American detective who fought crime and solved mysteries in his fictional Harlem neighborhood. 2. \\"The Little Dew Dillies\\" - A comedic tale written and drawn by Bill Driskell, this story centered around a group of child-like creatures in a magical forest who demonstrated the importance of friendship, decision-making, and learning from life's lessons. 3. \\"Hep Chicks on Parade\\" - This humorous feature, also created by Bill Driskell, portrayed fashionable, witty African American women who were unapologetic about their style and individuality. 4. \\"Lil' Eggie\\" - A single-page comic drawn by Dan Lundy, telling the misadventures of a young boy named Eggie and the life lessons he learned along the way. 5. \\"Sugarfoot\\" - A story written and illustrated by E.G. Lattimer, focusing on two African American musicians, Sugarfoot and Snake Oil, who used their wits and talents to overcome various challenges. 6. \\"Lion Man\\" - Written by Evans himself and drawn by George J. Evans Jr., this story introduced an African superhero named Lion Man, an educated scientist who fought evil forces to protect the African continent and its people. Despite the innovative spirit behind All Negro Comics, the series faced numerous challenges, including the difficulty of acquiring distribution channels and the rising costs of publishing. The initial print run of 15,000 copies, though successful, could not sustain the project in the long term. Due to these challenges and a possible boycott by some distributors, Evans was unable to secure funding for a second issue, leading to the end of All Negro Comics. Nevertheless, All Negro Comics left a lasting impression on the comic book industry and opened doors for future generations of African American creators. It marked the beginning of representation and diversity in American comic books, paving the way for prominent Black characters and creators to make their mark in the comic world. This publication remains an important symbol of African American struggle and resilience in the fight for equal representation and opportunities in media and popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give \\"Immortel\\" a chance. I nearly walked out of this movie, and I LIKE science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning/synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute movie. Three groups exist in this world: humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth \\"cap\\" on the pyramid. Wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there. I won't bore you with the so-called plot, but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes. The film, as I said, looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who don't speak French. Hence, it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting. It doesn't help that the animations are poor--no better than a video game. Skip this one. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Select from the following.

Question: What holds base pairs together? Context: Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1 Answer:","output":"Base pairs in a DNA double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds.

Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.

If you use thicker PVC pipe (like ¾” or 1”) the frame will be sturdier and you may not need this bracing. Look in any store that sells fabric for a bright green color of natural or synthetic fabric that won't wrinkle easily. Purchase at least 2-3 yards of fabric that is 48 inches wide or wider.  Note that a standard width for fabric is 48 inches, or 4 feet. If you want a green screen wider than that, look for fabric that comes in a 54\\" or 60” width, or sew two pieces of fabric together for an even larger size.  It’s also a good idea to iron your fabric so that it is free of wrinkles before use as a green screen. Visible wrinkles that show up on camera will interfere with the keying process that replaces the color with another image.  If you cannot find a suitable green color of fabric, you may be able to paint or dye fabric to your desired shade. However, this method may not turn out as even or consistent as a pre-dyed fabric.

It gives assurance that one is not obliged to make a purchase while requesting a quote. Also attached to the term \\"chat\\", reaffirming the company's commitment to discuss customer needs without the pressure of obligation.    - \\"quote\\": This noun is the object of the sentence, the thing that's being requested. A quote refers to a price estimate given by a company or service provider. - \\"here\\": This adverb is indicating the place where users can request the quote, the 'here' probably refers to a webpage or a direct chat interface. - \\"or\\": This conjunction is used to link different possibilities. In context, it's providing an alternative option for the reader. - \\"contact\\": This verb prompts the reader to get in touch with the service provider in some way, serving as another call to action. - \\"us\\": This pronoun refers to the service provider or company that's offering the no-obligation quote or chat about customer needs. - \\"for\\": This preposition is used to indicate the purpose or function of something.

He shared the (Gurdjieff) \\"system\\" for 25 years in England and the United States, having separated from Gurdjieff in 1924 personally, for reasons he explains in the last chapter of his book \\"In Search of the Miraculous\\".  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A yogi (sometimes spelled jogi) is a practitioner of yoga. In Vedic Sanskrit, yoga (from the root \\"yuj\\") means \\"to add\\", \\"to join\\", \\"to unite\\", or \\"to attach\\" in its most common literal sense, where in recent days, especially in the West, yoga often refers to physical exercises only. The term \\"yogi\\" is used broadly to refer to sannyasi or practitioners of meditation in a number of Indian religions.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random.

How do you do this: How can I safely melt two plastics together?","output":"Melting two plastics together can be a tricky process, especially if you're aiming to do it safely and effectively to create a strong bond. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you safely melt two plastics together: 1. Identify the type of plastics you're working with: Plastics come in various types, such as ABS, PLA, PET, PVC, HDPE, etc. It's crucial to know which types you're working with because different plastics have different melting points and require specific handling techniques. You can typically find this information on the label, embossed on the plastic, or by looking up the product specifications. 2. Gather the necessary equipment: To perform the melting process safely, ensure you have the following tools and safety gear:    - Heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands from burns    - Safety goggles to protect your eyes from debris and harmful fumes    - A well-ventilated area or a respirator mask to mitigate the risk of inhaling toxic fumes    - A heat source compatible with the type of plastic you're working with, such as a soldering iron, plastic welder, or hot air gun    - A non-flammable work surface 3. Prepare the plastic surfaces: Clean both plastic surfaces thoroughly to remove any dirt, oil, or debris that may interfere with the bonding process. This could involve using soap and water, rubbing alcohol, or in some cases a specialized plastic cleaner. 4. Heat the plastic: Keeping safety precautions in mind, turn on your heat source and let it reach the required temperature. Generally, most plastics have a melting temperature range between 200°F and 400°F (93°C to 204°C), but be sure to reference the specific melting temperature for the plastic types you're working with. 5. Apply heat evenly: Slowly and carefully, apply heat to both plastic surfaces you wish to join. Be sure to distribute the heat evenly for a consistent and reliable bond. Remember to wear your safety gear and work in a well-ventilated area. 6. Join the plastics together: Once both surfaces have reached their melting point and are softened, apply mild pressure to bring the plastics together. It's essential to maintain contact until the melted sections cool and harden, solidifying the bond. You may use clamps or a vice to hold the pieces together if needed. 7. Optional reinforcement: In some cases, you may choose to use a filler rod made from the same type of plastic to add strength and reinforcement to the joined area. When applying the filler rod, heat it using the heat source until it becomes molten and can easily be pushed into the seam where the two plastic pieces are joined. Smooth out the filler rod to ensure a proper bond. 8. Allow the plastics to cool: Once the plastics have been successfully melted and joined, it's essential to let them cool and harden completely. Patience is key during this step, as premature handling of the joined plastics can lead to a weakened bond or damage to the materials. 9. Inspect the bond: After the melted plastic has cooled and hardened, be sure to inspect the bond for strength and consistency. If you notice any inconsistencies, flaws, or weak spots, you may need to repeat the process or consider using a different method like adhesive bonding or mechanical fastening. Please note that the process may vary depending on the specific type of plastic you're working with. Always consult the material specifications and follow the appropriate guidelines for safe handling and processing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Югославия на зимних Олимпийских играх 1948 Could you please translate this to English?","output":"\\"Yugoslavia at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games\\" The phrase is a reference to the participation of the former country of Yugoslavia in the Winter Olympic Games held in 1948. The 1948 Winter Olympics, also known as the V Olympic Winter Games, took place in St. Moritz, Switzerland, from January 30 to February 8. Yugoslavia, a socialist state in Southeast Europe that existed from 1929 until 2003, had a rich history of participation in various sports events, including the Winter Olympic Games. Though the country eventually dissolved into several successor states (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia), its athletes' accomplishments during the Yugoslav period are still remembered and celebrated today. In the 1948 Winter Olympics, Yugoslavia sent a team of 19 athletes to compete in several sports disciplines such as alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and ice hockey. These athletes represented their country with pride and contributed to the rich legacy of Yugoslav sports achievements. Some interesting facts about Yugoslavia at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games are: 1. This was the first time Yugoslavia participated in the Winter Olympics. The country previously competed in the Summer Olympics, starting with the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium. 2. Although Yugoslavia did not win any medals in the 1948 Winter Olympics, several athletes recorded noteworthy performances and personal bests. 3. One of the most notable Yugoslav athletes at the 1948 Winter Olympics was ski jumper Božo Tomašević. He became the first Yugoslav athlete to compete in ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, finishing 45th in the individual event. 4. In ice hockey, Yugoslavia finished in 9th place, defeating the Austrian team in their final match during the tournament. 5. Female figure skater Metka Potočnik, who participated in the individual women's competition, became one of the earliest female Olympians representing Yugoslavia. While Yugoslavia did not secure any medals during the 1948 Winter Olympic Games, the event marked the beginning of a long and storied history of Winter Olympic participation for the country and its successor states. Subsequent Winter Olympic Games saw these athletes improve their standings, achieving medals and memorable milestones that showcased their dedication, talent, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Countries emerging from the dissolution of Yugoslavia, like Slovenia and Croatia, continued participating in the Winter Olympics, building upon the legacy left behind by the Yugoslav athletes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"A man in plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt stands in front of a stack of boxes in front of a Pizza from Naples store.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The man is singing to a woman\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"A man in plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt stands in front of a stack of boxes in front of a Pizza from Naples store,\\" we cannot definitively determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. The premise provides a description of the man's appearance and location, but it does not provide any information about his actions or the presence of a woman. To analyze the premise in more detail, let's break it down into its key components: 1. A man is present. 2. The man is wearing plaid shorts and a blue t-shirt. 3. The man is standing in front of a stack of boxes. 4. The man is in front of a Pizza from Naples store. In contrast, the hypothesis contains information that is not mentioned or described in the premise: 1. The man is singing. 2. A woman is present. 3. The man is singing to the woman. As you can see, there is a clear disconnect between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise only gives us information about the man's attire and his location, while the hypothesis concerns the actions of the man, the presence of a woman, and the interaction between them. Since the premise does not provide any data that supports or contradicts the hypothesis, we cannot determine its truth or falsehood based solely on the information given in the premise. Therefore, it is crucial to gather more information and contextual details to assess whether the hypothesis is true or not. For example, if we had additional observational data indicating that the man was indeed singing and directing his performance towards a nearby woman, the hypothesis would be better substantiated.

Article: Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between races and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil. The agency called it \\"a step toward the promise of personalized medicine.\\" Question: Which of the following orders is from higher to lower risk of having lung cancer?

Step 1: Examine the soil types Jim's land has clay soil, while Bob's land has very fertile soil (which is most likely loam or silt). Step 2: Assess soil's relation to filtration capacity Clay soil tends to have low permeability due to its small particle size and tightly packed structure. This results in slow water infiltration and reduced filtration capacity. On the other hand, fertile soils like loam or silt generally have better permeability and water holding capacity, which leads to higher filtration capacity. Step 3: Consider the effect of pH on filtration capacity Jim's land has a high pH, which could potentially affect the availability of certain nutrients in the soil.

The answer to the question: What did the Tibetans capture in 678? is inside the article: Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"In 678, the Tibetans captured the Silk Road from the Tang dynasty of China. The Silk Road was an important trade route, connecting China to Europe and the Western world. This capture led to the closure of the Silk Road for some time, impacting trade and the exchange of ideas and cultures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - More than once a week. - Most times that macaroni and cheese is served. - not enough information - Usually at lunch time. Answer:","output":"Not enough information The preference for calorie-dense and high-salt foods can vary greatly between individuals, depending on their upbringing, culture, personal taste preferences, and exposure to different types of foods through their lifetime. Additionally, the frequency of consumption of such foods can also be influenced by factors like socioeconomic status, availability, accessibility, and marketing of high-salt and calorie-dense foods. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific frequency or mealtime when individuals with a preference for calorie-dense diets would consume high salt foods without more information about their background and habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bush, in which he addresses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his statement, President Bush urges Israel to halt the expansion of settlements in the occupied territories and put an end to the daily suffering and humiliation faced by the Palestinian people. He also emphasizes the importance of democratic reform within the Palestinian community to reach a resolution for the ongoing conflict.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a longstanding political and territorial dispute between the state of Israel and the Palestinians, primarily centered around issues such as borders, refugees, security, and the legal and political status of Jerusalem. Settlements are Israeli civilian communities built on lands occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, which include the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. These settlements have been a major point of contention between both parties, as they are viewed as illegal under international law and a major hurdle to the peace process. In calling for a \\"freeze\\" on settlements, President Bush is essentially requesting that Israel stops the expansion and establishment of new settlements in these disputed territories. By doing so, he hopes to facilitate negotiation and compromise between the two parties, leading to a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Furthermore, President Bush also addresses the need for the Palestinians to commit to democratic reform. Achieving a stable, transparent, and accountable governing system is vital for fostering peace and building trust between Israelis and Palestinians.

Here are possible answers to this question: - breathe - experience sadness - forget nothing - remember everything - to get food  I believe the correct choice is \\"remember everything\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, and the correct choice for the reason behind this action is \\"remember everything.\\" Elephants are known for their exceptional memory and cognitive abilities, which sets them apart from many other animal species. This unique trait has been the subject of much fascination and scientific study, as researchers continue to explore the intricacies of the elephant's brain and its advanced capacity for remembering information. One of the main reasons why the elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier is to display its remarkable ability to remember everything. Studies have shown that elephants can remember not only numbers but also faces, scents, locations, and events. This ability of elephants plays a crucial role in their survival and social interactions. In the wild, elephants rely on their extraordinary memory to guide them to water and food sources, which might be seasonal and scarce. Remembering the locations of these resources and the best migration routes helps elephants conserve energy and optimize their resource utilization. Additionally, the matriarchs of elephant herds, who are responsible for leading the group, possess vast knowledge of their environment and share this information with younger generations, contributing to group cohesion and collective memory. Furthermore, elephants also exhibit strong emotional intelligence, allowing them to remember and recognize members of their family, as well as the bonds they share with other individuals. They can form lasting friendships and grieve the death of their loved ones. This ability to remember other elephants and their relationships with them is crucial for maintaining social order within the herd. Asking the elephant to recall a number mentioned earlier serves as a demonstration of its cognitive prowess. The prime reasoning behind this action is to showcase the elephant's exceptional ability to remember everything, highlighting its unique status among animals. The other options provided, such as breathe, experience sadness, forget nothing, and to get food, although related to various aspects of an elephant's life, do not accurately explain why the elephant was asked to recall the number. Remembering everything is the most fitting reason, as it emphasizes the elephant's distinct cognitive abilities and illustrates its remarkable memory, which is crucial for the survival, social structure, and emotional wellbeing of these majestic creatures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For added efficiency, you may put 3-4 clean tennis balls into the dryer as well. This will help to massage the pillows during the drying cycle and ensure the material inside the pillows remains uniformly fluffed. Step 4: Set the dryer on low heat To prevent any damage to the pillows, it's important to use a 'low heat' or 'air fluff' setting. This is because high heat could cause potential damage to the pillow's materials and integrity. Step 5: Run the dryer and monitor Start the dryer and routinely check on the progress of the pillows throughout the drying process.

Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century.

A moment later, he stopped again, saying, “What do you want me to tell Mr. Romney?”      “I can’t tell him that. He can’t do that to himself,” Mr. Eastwood said. “You’re getting as bad as Biden.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Initially, there were no plans for Mr. Eastwood to take a chair onstage. But at the last minute, the actor asked the production staff backstage if he could use one but did not explain why.      Had Mr. Eastwood appeared earlier, many fewer people might have noticed. The networks began their hour of convention coverage at 10 p.m. Eastern time, which meant that Mr. Eastwood was the first act of the night for their millions of viewers.

Mr. Stevens, in an interview, said he would not discuss internal decision making, but he said that Mr. Romney was backstage during Mr. Eastwood’s remarks.

As they flew home from Tampa on Friday, some delegates grumbled that Mr. Eastwood was a waste of a prime-time slot that might have been better used to feature other speakers or the biographical video of Mr. Romney’s life.      Mr. Eastwood is generally liked and respected in Hollywood, where his colleagues often do not agree with his politics. Leonard Hirshan, Mr. Eastwood’s manager, said the actor was traveling and would not be available for interviews.      Mr. Hirshan said he had heard a chorus of response since the speech, divided evenly between those supportive and those critical. Mr. Eastwood’s next film, “Trouble With the Curve,” is set for release on Sept. 21.

He believes in what he’s doing.” ||||| Moments before Clint Eastwood approached the lectern at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night, he asked a stagehand to get him a chair.      Everyone just assumed he was going to sit in it.      Fans that night may have expected to hear from “Dirty Harry”: the cool, controlled enforcer, as deft with a quip as with a gun, effortlessly and eternally hip. Instead, they got something closer to Walt Kowalski, the grizzled old cuss of Eastwood’s 2008 “Gran Torino”: raw, unpolished, a little angry and suddenly much older than you realized.      Senior campaign aides said Friday that the unscripted routine by the actor-director — easily the biggest show-biz heavyweight to stand up for a GOP candidate since Frank Sinatra did it for Ronald Reagan — was something of a surprise.      The Oscar winner, 82, spoke off the cuff, having discussed a few talking points with campaign advisers and sketched out some rough remarks but preparing nothing for the prompters. Organizers were comfortable with this setup: At the early August fundraiser in Idaho where Eastwood first came out publicly for Mitt Romney, he delivered suave impromptu remarks that had other guests raving.      Instead, Eastwood’s wacky conversation with the empty chair (standing in for President Obama — and viewed by about 33 million people, according to Nielsen) became an instant Internet meme. His rambling style triggered snark about his health and his age. His old-timey lawyer jokes brought on a wave of triumphant fact-checking/rebuttal (Romney, like Obama, has a JD).      Inside the Tampa convention hall, the crowd roared with delight at Eastwood’s humor. But as Thursday night turned into Friday, Twitter and talking heads piled on the mockery, some claiming Eastwood had managed to upstage and undercut the Republican nominee’s acceptance speech. Ann Romney coolly deemed the actor’s performance “unique” Friday on “CBS This Morning.”      “I didn’t know it was coming,” she said with a nervous laugh.      Don’t look for Eastwood on the campaign trail this fall. His longtime manager said Friday that the star was traveling back from Florida and unavailable for interview requests or comments — and that hewill not speak to the press at all until he hits the promotional circuit for his next movie, “Trouble With the Curve,” opening Sept. 21.      When Eastwood gives his next interviews, manager Leonard Hirshan said,“he’s speaking about the picture, not everything else.”      On Friday, the Romney campaign expressed gratitude for the support of a beloved screen icon — no matter how quirky his delivery.      “He went out and did what actors do sometimes: He did a little improv,” said Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist.      Convention producers warily eyed the clock as Eastwood ran over his allotted five minutes by six or seven minutes. And the empty-chair gimmick was a complete surprise.      “This was an idea, a moment that moved him, I would say, and he went with it,” Stevens said.      He said Romney, standing backstage, laughed appreciatively through Eastwood’s talk. And Stevens praised Eastwood for hitting key talking points: “For him to go out there and to say that there’s a need to change presidents and that he supports Mitt Romney and talk about 23 million people out of work as he did and talk about when someone doesn’t do their job you need to change, that’s a powerful message.”      Questioned by a reporter from an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads, Va., Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, said, “I think Clint Eastwood was just being Clint Eastwood.”      A rumored Eastwood appearance had been the buzz of the convention from Day 1, after several decades of the Hollywood establishment closing ranks behind Democrats. Entertainers have been especially helpful to the Obama administration, with A-listers such as George Clooney and Sarah Jessica Parker mounting mega-dollar fundraisers for his reelection.      “I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking: ‘What’s a movie tradesman doing out here? They’re all left-wingers out there!’ ” Eastwood told the convention hall audience Thursday. But there are indeed “conservative people, moderate people” in Hollywood, he said. They just “play it closer to the vest.”      Despite dabbling in politics for years — most notably as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., from 1986 to 1988 — Eastwood’s evolving and hard-to-pin-down views have added to his superstar mystique. An occasional Republican voter who allies with many socially liberal causes, he has long resembled a screenwriter’s fantasy of the perfect square-jawed candidate, which may be why many fans project their beliefs onto him. His evocative but cryptic Chrysler ad that aired during this year’s Super Bowl was interpreted by many pundits as a celebration of the Obama auto-industry bailout — although Eastwood, in fact, opposed it.      In an interview with The Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday in November, Eastwood happily talked politics but made no pretense of being a wonk.      Many Hollywood types dabbling in advocacy love to show off their mastery of policy, but Eastwood (“I’ve never been a really astute political person”) uttered the simple hopes and gripes of your typical man-on-the-street interview.      “They all come up now and they all say the same thing,” he said of politicians, Republican and Democratic alike. “They tell you what they want to get in, and when they get in, they all do something different, so you get the futility aspect of it all.”      Although he endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008, Eastwood said he felt good about Obama’s election, at first. “I thought: ‘Well, that’s cool. . . . That’ll be nice for the country and maybe it’ll settle down a lot of racial issues.’ ” Instead, “it kind of went the other way,” he told Hornaday, citing his frustration with how Obama seemed to pick sides in the hot-button dispute when African American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested by a white police officer in Cambridge, Mass. “Just a bad way to jump into it,” Eastwood said.      Romney didn’t seem to be on Eastwood’s agenda last fall. (“I liked that fellow from New Jersey, [Gov. Chris] Christie,” he told Hornaday.) It was just over a month ago that he approached the former Massachusetts governor’s campaign to express his support, and he got invited to a pair of Sun Valley, Idaho, events on Aug. 3.      “He didn’t act like a Hollywood star,” one guest said. The fundraiser, who was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly, noted that Eastwood had no entourage and made no demands. He posed for pictures with police officers and Secret Service agents and sat at a table eating dinner and conversing with other supporters.      “He really wowed both audiences in Sun Valley and could not have been more gracious to the attendees and to Mitt Romney and to the staff,” the fundraiser said.      As for the speech Thursday night, the fundraiser said, “I think the nature of Clint Eastwood is he is unpredictable.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The article talks about actor Clint Eastwood giving a speech at the Republican National Convention in support of Mitt Romney.

Question: Question: where is thomas more buried I found the following answer on Google: He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the information provided does not answer the question about where Thomas More is buried. While it is true that he was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century, this does not provide information about his burial location. Thomas More, an English lawyer, philosopher, and statesman, was a key figure during the reign of King Henry VIII. He was a staunch critic of the Protestant Reformation and the king's separation from the Catholic Church, which ultimately led to his execution. More was convicted of treason and beheaded on July 6, 1535 in London. Following his execution, his body was initially buried in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. The Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula is a Royal Chapel and a place where many people who were executed in the Tower, including some of the most prominent figures of English history like Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard, and Jane Grey, were laid to rest. However, it is widely believed that Thomas More's head, which was displayed on a spike on London Bridge for some time, was eventually retrieved by his daughter Margaret Roper. She is said to have preserved her father's head and later had it interred with her when she passed away. Margaret Roper and her family were buried in St. Dunstan's Church in Canterbury, and it is thought that Thomas More's head might be buried there alongside her. In summary, Thomas More's body is buried in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula in London, and his head is believed to be buried in St. Dunstan's Church in Canterbury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The first country in Oceania, and the fifteenth overall, to legalize same-sex marriage was New Zealand. New Zealand officially legalized same-sex marriage on April 17, 2013, after passing the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 through the New Zealand Parliament, amending the original 1955 Marriage Act. The bill was introduced by Labour Party Member of Parliament Louisa Wall and was passed with a majority of 77 votes in favour and 44 against. The journey towards legalizing same-sex marriage in New Zealand began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with various political parties and advocacy groups pushing for recognition of same-sex couples. The first major breakthrough towards legal recognition came in 2004 with the introduction of the Civil Union Act, which granted same-sex couples many of the same rights and responsibilities as heterosexual married couples. However, this still fell short of full marriage equality, which advocates continued to push for in the following years. The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 was a significant milestone for LGBTQ+ rights in New Zealand. It redefined marriage as a union between two individuals, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, making it inclusive and equal for all citizens of the country. The granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples commenced on August 19, 2013, and the first same-sex weddings took place soon after, on August 31, 2013. While the amendment was met with some resistance from conservative political and religious groups, overall, the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand continued the country's long-standing track record of being supportive of progressive social policies. In fact, New Zealand has been at the forefront of many significant milestones in LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality, such as granting same-sex couples adoption rights in 2013 and having one of the first openly transgender Members of Parliament, Georgina Beyer. Since the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand, numerous other countries in Oceania have followed suit, such as Australia in 2017. However, there are still several nations in the region where same-sex relationships remain unrecognized or are actively penalized. In summary, New Zealand was the first country in Oceania, and the fifteenth globally, to legalize same-sex marriage. The passage of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 made marriage an inclusive right for all citizens, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, and set a precedent for future progress in LGBTQ+ rights across Oceania and the rest of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Pennsylvania's acting secretary of labor and industry has entered a rehabilitation program for at least two weeks after her arrest on a public drunkenness charge last week. Sandi Vito, Pennsylvania's acting labor secretary, has entered a rehab program, the governor's spokesman says. Just a few hours before her arrest, Sandi Vito backed out of a scheduled interview with a CNN correspondent about the state's controversial use of debit cards to pay unemployment benefits. Vito, who was appointed acting secretary of labor and industry in February 2008, \\"has entered a treatment program for two weeks,\\" according to Gov. Ed Rendell's chief spokesman. \\"The governor awaits her return before making any final decisions on her future,\\" the spokesman, Chuck Ardo, told CNN on Monday. CNN had been invited to a public appearance that Vito was making in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, to ask her about the fees banks impose when people choose to receive their unemployment benefits by debit cards instead of checks.  Watch how bank fees can surprise people on unemployment ». Those fees range from forty cents to check a balance by telephone, to 1.75 if the debit card is used outside the two free withdrawal periods banks allow. Approximately 925,000 Pennsylvanians were unemployed last month and most used debit cards to receive payments, Pennsylvania officials said. \\"Arrangements have been made for you to interview Department of Labor & Industry Acting Secretary Sandi Vito in Allentown tomorrow at approximately 1 p.m., to discuss our unemployment compensation debit card program,\\" David Smith, a spokesman for the department, e-mailed CNN prior to the scheduled meeting. Yet when a CNN correspondent, accompanied by a camera crew, attempted to interview Vito, she said she did not have the time and ducked out the back door of an elementary school where the public appearance was being staged. An official from her department did give CNN an interview. Later that same night, Vito was arrested on a charge of public drunkenness at the Hilton Hotel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to Harrisburg Police Chief Charles Keller. News of her arrest did not become public until late Friday. \\"I deeply regret that my actions earlier this week caused embarrassment to the administration and the commonwealth,\\" Vito said in a statement issued to CNN by her office. \\"I take full responsibility for those actions.\\" \\"This incident has had a profound personal effect on me,\\" her statement continued. \\"Today, I am entering an alcohol treatment program because it is the right thing for me to do.\\" According to public records, Vito earns a salary of 136,120 annually. Her appointment as permanent secretary of labor and industry was to have been brought before the Pennsylvania legislature in a few weeks. Highlights:","output":"1.

Here are the steps to follow: 1. Note the given information:    - The radius of the wheel is 70 cm.    - The speed of the bus is 66 km/h. 2. Convert the radius to meters and the speed to meters per minute:    - Radius: 70 cm = 0.7 meters (divide by 100, as there are 100 cm in 1 meter)    - Speed: 66 km/h = 66,000 meters/h (multiply by 1,000, as there are 1,000 meters in 1 km). To convert 66,000 meters per hour to meters per minute, divide by 60 (as there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the speed in meters per minute is 66,000 / 60 = 1,100 meters/minute. 3. Calculate the circumference of the wheel, using the formula: Circumference = 2 * pi * radius    - Circumference = 2 * pi * 0.7 ≈ 4.4 meters (pi is approximately equal to 3.14) 4. Find the number of wheel revolutions needed to cover a given distance:    - Since the wheel covers the distance equal to its circumference in one revolution, to cover the bus speed of 1,100 meters per minute, we need to find out how many times the wheel's circumference (4.4 meters) fits into the total distance covered in one minute (1,100 meters).    - To do this, divide the distance covered in a minute (1,100 meters) by the circumference of the wheel (4.4 meters). 5. Calculate revolutions per minute (rpm):    - rpm = 1,100 meters/minute ÷ 4.4 meters ≈ 250 revolutions per minute. So, the wheel's revolutions per minute (rpm) is approximately 250."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a question about this article: As a result of the Libyan Civil War, the United Nations enacted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libya, and the protection of civilians from the forces of Muammar Gaddafi. The United States, along with Britain, France and several other nations, committed a coalition force against Gaddafi's forces. On 19 March, the first U.S. action was taken when 114 Tomahawk missiles launched by US and UK warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the Gaddafi regime. The U.S. continued to play a major role in Operation Unified Protector, the NATO-directed mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalition's actions in the theater. Throughout the conflict however, the U.S. maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect civilians, while the real conflict was between Gaddafi's loyalists and Libyan rebels fighting to depose him.

While both options may be true, choosing option II, \\"Megan is a friend to others,\\" is a more fitting continuation of the sentence provided. This selection emphasizes the camaraderie and supportive nature of Megan, which gives context to why Natalie is stopping by to congratulate her. It suggests that Megan's interpersonal relationships and her friendships are essential components of her character and are highly valued by her friends, like Natalie. Moreover, it highlights the mutual appreciation and affection within their social circle, creating a rich tapestry of connections among the individuals involved.  Option I, on the other hand, focuses on Natalie's ability to be a friend, which is not directly related to the subject matter of the original sentence. While it is a nice sentiment and could be a valid addition to the story, to maintain the flow of the narrative and keep the focus on Megan's importance, it is better to choose option II.

According to videos and tweets from the night, West told fans —in no particular order — that if he'd voted he would have voted for Donald Trump; that Trump’s approach to campaigning was \\"absolutely genius because it fucking worked\\"; that black people need to stop \\"being distracted\\" by racism and accept that the US is a racist country; and that he himself is still planning to run for president in 2020.      West seems to have peppered these comments and more throughout the entire night, with concertgoers reporting that he repeatedly stopped songs, sometimes to go on longer rants, and sometimes just to make a single comment. Twitter user @RaptorJesuss live-tweeted the entire show, but here are some of the highlights:      Kanye just said he thinks he'll have the experience in 2020 to run for office, I'm dead serious, Kanye just said he's preparing for 2020. — Raptor (@RaptorJesuss) November 18, 2016      Kanye West just stopped the show again to tell us that Kanye liked Trumps campaign.

Answer the following question: Information:  - De Oratore (\\"On the Orator\\"; not to be confused with \\"Orator\\") is a dialogue written by Cicero in 55 BCE. It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome.  - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius .  - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC  7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.  - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC  78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's \\"Parallel Lives\\" Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander.

Andy is playing with a rubber band. He stretches the rubber band out as far as he can without breaking it  Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:","output":"Based on the paragraph, compressing a spring will cause it to return to its original shape.

If there’s one thing that’s consistent about Netflix’s “House of Cards,” it’s that there are always several moments each season that stick with you for awhile — and not necessarily in a good way. Whether it’s Zoe Barnes getting pushed in front of a Metro train or Frank and Claire Underwood inviting a Secret Service agent into the bedroom for some unexpected extracurricular activities, there’s no shortage of strange images in the first two seasons. That grand tradition continues into Season 3, which premiered Friday. [Related: What happened on “House of Cards” Season 2? Here’s a reminder.] I’m four episodes in (your viewing speed may vary), and there’s already a lot going on. Frank officially swindled his way into becoming president, but it’s not going very well: He can’t get any bills passed and his own party would prefer he not run in the 2016 election. Claire manipulates everything to become United Nations ambassador. Doug Stamper, formerly Frank’s right-hand man, survived being attacked by Rachel (the prostitute he tried to kidnap last season) but is recovering incredibly slowly. Hacker Gavin hates working as the FBI, even if it’s a trade-off for not going to jail — but he’s trying to help Doug track down Rachel, because she still knows too much. Oh, and we learn that Secretary of State Catherine Durant has killer beer pong skills. And of course, along with the intertwining plot lines and notable cameos (Stephen Colbert and Pussy Riot thus far), there have been the requisite disturbing moments.

Choices:  - brain tissues  - intestines  - bones  - lungs  A: The answer is:","output":"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the provided choices step-by-step: 1. Brain tissues: While CO2 does get transported to the brain, the primary role of hemoglobin is to transport oxygen, not CO2. So, this choice is not the most accurate. 2. Intestines: CO2 is not primarily transported to the intestines by hemoglobin. The main function of the intestines is to absorb nutrients and transport them to the bloodstream, not handle gas exchange. 3. Bones: Hemoglobin does not bind to CO2 to transport it to bones. The primary function of bones is to provide support and protect vital organs, and they don't play a significant role in gas exchange. 4. Lungs: The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate gas exchange, which includes removing CO2 from the blood. Hemoglobin binds to CO2 in tissues and transports it back to the lungs, where it is released and exhaled. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: A: Lungs"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Plot title: A Knight's Tale Movie plot: At a jousting tournament in 14th-century Europe, young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize. Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their share of coins and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of \\"Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein\\" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armour is damaged. He goads Kate, a female blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the sword event at the tournament. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust of the tournament, Adhemar defeats William. Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour allowing him greater mobility. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Edward, the Black Prince. Adhemar withdraws, but William continues the match and then addresses the prince by name, further earning Edward's respect. Adhemar... My question: What century does A Knight's tale take place in?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Invincible Context: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling.  - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921  8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\".  - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914  5 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage, he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" in which he played eight different characters. He is also known for his six collaborations with David Lean: Herbert Pocket in \\"Great Expectations\\" (1946), Fagin in \\"Oliver Twist\\" (1948), Col. Nicholson in \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" (1957, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Prince Faisal in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (1962), General Yevgraf Zhivago in \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" (1965), and Professor Godbole in \\"A Passage to India\\" (1984). He is also known for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  - Doctor in Distress is a 1963 British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Dirk Bogarde , James Robertson Justice , and Samantha Eggar . It 's the fifth of the seven films in the Doctor series . After a one - film absence , it marked the final return to the role of Simon Sparrow by Dirk Bogarde , and also the return ( although in a different role ) of Donald Houston . The film uses some of the characters in Richard Gordon 's Doctor novels , but is n't based on any of the novels .  - Donald Daniel Houston (6 November 1923  13 October 1991) was a Welsh actor whose first two films  \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" (1949) with Jean Simmons, and \\"A Run for Your Money\\" (1949) with Sir Alec Guinness  were highly successful. Later in his career he was cast in military roles and in comedies such as the \\"Doctor\\" and \\"Carry On\\" series.    'doctor in distress ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'production company'?  Choices: - prince  - rank organisation  - screen  - united kingdom The answer to this question is:","output":"- Rank Organisation In the shared information, it was mentioned that the Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate that produced numerous films. Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde, who starred in the \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) was identified as one of the actors working for the Rank Organisation. Additionally, the film \\"Doctor in Distress,\\" which was released in 1963 and starred Dirk Bogarde, is another one from the same \\"Doctor\\" series. This leads us to make an informed guess that \\"Doctor in Distress\\" was produced by the Rank Organisation. Therefore, the movie 'doctor in distress ' is related to the entity 'Rank Organisation' through the relation of 'production company'.  Established in 1937 by J. Arthur Rank, the Rank Organisation quickly became one of the most significant and integrated film companies in Britain, being involved in film production, distribution, and exhibition. Besides the movie industry, it even branched into the production of radios, TVs, and photocopiers being part of Rank Xerox. However, over the years, the original Rank Organisation underwent several structural changes and reductions in its operations, and by 1996 its name and remaining assets were absorbed into the Rank Group Plc which now predominantly focuses on gambling. On a side note, Dirk Bogarde, after portraying leading roles in commercial films like the \\"Doctor\\" series for the Rank Organisation, later delved into art-house films. He then pursued writing, creating seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels, and a volume of collected journalism, primarily for The Daily Telegraph, a major national British daily broadsheet newspaper.  One should also be mindful that the film industry is a complicated mixture of artistry and commerce. Films, also known as movies or motion pictures, are created by capturing a series of still images and displaying them rapidly on a screen, which gives the illusion of motion to the viewer due to a phenomenon known as the 'phi' phenomenon. The process of making a film can involve several techniques, ranging from photographing actual scenes or using miniatures in traditional animation to using advanced computer graphics and animation.  A bit about another character Donald Houston, a Welsh actor recognized for his roles in comedies such as the \\"Doctor\\" and \\"Carry On\\" series and military-related films. The reference to Sir Alec Guinness, another acclaimed English actor, relates more broadly to the context of classic British cinema. Guinness is perhaps most remembered for his roles in several Ealing Comedies, his collaborations with David Lean, and of course, his iconic role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.  In summary, comedy as a film genre has played a pivotal role in the industry, with organizations like the Rank Organisation leading in the production of such films, and actors like Dirk Bogarde, Donald Houston, and Alec Guinness being key performers in these comedic roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why might the Butterfly Garden be closed ?","output":"There could be several reasons why the Butterfly Garden at the Pacific Science Garden was closed for the week. Some of these reasons might include: 1. Maintenance and Upkeep: It is possible that the Butterfly Garden was closed for routine maintenance or needed repairs. Gardens require regular care, such as trimming plants, repairing pathways, managing insect populations, and maintaining the butterfly habitat. Closing the garden for a week could provide the staff with the opportunity to complete tasks without disturbing visitors and ensuring the safety and well-being of the butterflies. 2. Seasonal Changes: Depending on the time of the year, the Butterfly Garden might be closed due to seasonal changes. Butterflies thrive in specific temperature ranges and humidity levels. The Butterfly Garden might be closed temporarily if the local climate or natural butterfly life cycle requires adjustments to the environment to ensure optimal living conditions for the butterflies. 3. Staff Training or Vacation: The Butterfly Garden may be closed if the staff is attending training sessions, team-building activities, or taking a scheduled vacation. As an integral part of running a successful garden, it is essential to have trained and motivated staff members. 4. Private Events: Occasionally, gardens and other public spaces may close for private events, such as weddings, corporate functions, or educational programs. These events might require exclusive access to the Butterfly Garden, resulting in temporary closure for the general public. 5. Pests or Diseases: The Butterfly Garden could also be closed due to unexpected issues, such as a pest breakout or the presence of diseases that could affect the health of the butterflies and plants. In such cases, closing the garden would be necessary to prevent further damage and allow staff to treat and control the problem. 6. Renovations or Expansions: The garden may have been closed for the week to undergo renovations or expansions. It could be that the garden is adding new features, plants, or butterfly species to enhance the visitor's experience in the future. While these are some of the possible reasons for the temporary closure of the Butterfly Garden, it is always best to check the operating hours and any announcements on their website or social media platforms for specific reasons or updates before visiting the garden to avoid any disappointment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days.

Article:Among the glamorous chandeliers and big mirrors dozens of women are browsing rails of patterned skirts, trying on brightly coloured coats and buying items from the designer collection. Women's fashion chain Bonmarche's flagship store in Uxbridge has had a complete makeover. The aim: to make it as easy as possible for the more mature lady to shop. From easier-to-read price tags and bigger changing rooms to comfy seats for husbands to rest on, this store now feels like Top Shop for the over-50s. Trading conditions may be tough on the High Street, but this fashion chain is making quite a comeback. In fact, it is hard to think of another retail business that's turned itself around, from administration, as quickly or as successfully as Bonmarche. The company, and its owner, the fashion chain Peacocks, went under in January 2012 in one of the biggest retail collapses since Woolworths. It buckled under massive debts. When Bonmarche fell into administration, it had nearly 400 shops. Private investors snapped it up for around Â£10m. It now has 265 stores across the UK, and is worth more than Â£100m, having recently floated 40% of its shares on the stock market. Beth Butterwick was put in charge of the turnaround as chief executive. In her first interview, she told me she had no doubts about the chain's potential. \\"I could see the opportunity to really cater for this growing demographic. I could absolutely see that Bonmarche was a gem amongst the High Street, it just needed to be loved,\\" Mrs Butterwick says. Women's fashion is hugely competitive, with many chains chasing the younger shopper. Mrs Butterwick decided that the key to Bonmarche's success was to focus solely on older women. \\"The business before had drifted into catering products for a much younger customer and putting prices up. In other words they had moved away from the core values of our business. \\"So the low-hanging fruit was to reposition the clothing back to the core customer,\\" reflects Mrs Butterwick. The strategy appears to be working. Since this store in Uxbridge re-opened, sales are up a whopping 40%. \\"We have an amazingly loyal customer base, some 6.5 million customers. And we've made it our mission to cater for the way they want to shop. \\"We have three different sets of customers spanning three different generations, the late-40s up to the late-80s,\\" says Mrs Butterwick. Another ingredient in Bonmarche's success has been celebrity designer David Emanuel, the man who designed Princess Diana's wedding dress (and recent contestant on ITV show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!). His collections for the chain have proved hugely popular. He told me the larger, more mature lady has been neglected by the fashion industry. \\"Just because women get to a certain age doesn't mean women lose sight of fashion. They want to look fashionable and want to be flattered. Women are now virtually ageless, if they dress well,\\" he says. \\"My challenge as a designer is to provide stylish clothing at affordable prices, season after season. Once the lady grows older, we have to look after her and our customers keep coming back.\\" Did he worry that Bonmarche might not survive? \\"The dark days, I'm delighted to say, have gone. I'm very excited.\\" He also believes having a woman at the helm is key. \\"Now there's a woman in charge who believes in the label, believes in David Emanuel, believes in Bonmarche, believes in her customers and she's done an enormous amount of work,\\" he says. \\"It's a completely different business... it's like chalk and cheese. And that's all down to her. Of course, she's got professional teams around her, she's handpicked key people who love the business with a passion. \\"She thinks fashion, she feels fashion, she deals with fashion and we're on the same wavelength.\\" The turnaround plan involved closing dozens of unprofitable stores. The new management team negotiated new rent deals on many existing stores. Unlike most national chains, they're now looking to expand once more, opening new High Street stores. They've opened several shops in garden centres, and they're looking at selling clothes on cruise ships and in care homes. The aim is to go where the customers are. And it is certainly where the growth is in retail. \\"The prospects for serving the older consumer in retail are enormous, because if you look over to the next 10 years the vast majority of the growth, well over two-thirds, comes from the plus-55 consumer,\\" according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino. \\"So any retailer who serves that segment of the market hasn't got success guaranteed but it has got a much greater chance of seeing sales traction than someone serving other demographic groups.\\" Bonmarche doesn't have much in the way of competition on the High Street for now. The question is, for how long? In his studio, Mr Emanuel has finished the Bonmarche spring collection, sprinkled with prints and pinks, and he's already starting to think about next winter's ranges. He knows what the future challenge will be. \\"Everybody now realises what we're doing, and people are trying to emulate us, which is always very flattering,\\" he says. \\"We're getting it right, and investors are excited but we need to stay one step ahead.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"In this article, there is a store called Bonmarche, which sells clothes for women who are a bit older.

Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample.  and a hint : A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules.  Please answer this question : In which sample no carbon atom would branch off, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we can refer to the given hint about the characteristics of each type of molecule: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as George T. Morgan from the following article ?  James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1, 1869.  A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5, attended by the facility's employees. The Director of the Mint, Henry Linderman, delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy, which was given by Longacre's assistant, William Barber, who would be appointed as Longacre's successor.  Like each of his predecessors, Longacre died in office.Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928.  In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, \\"uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [Thomas] Sully, [Titian] Peale, [Robert] Hughes, and Gobrecht\\" and \\"whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint.\\"  However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.In his 1991 article, McKenzie notes Vermeule's concerns, but considers Longacre's work important for its use of American symbols, including the representations of Native Americans.  He believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as George T. Morgan, Victor D. Brenner, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.  He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle, calling it \\"unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest-denomination U.S. coin\\", and applauds \\"the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art\\".According to Bowers, \\"Today, Longacre is widely admired by numismatists.\\"  Lange notes that Longacre's \\"artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins\\".

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The differences between the use of \\"in\\" and \\"on\\", as well as the usage of \\"will\\" and \\"would\\" are distinct and based on specific grammatical rules. 1. Difference between \\"in\\" and \\"on\\": \\"In\\" and \\"on\\" are prepositions that express different relationships between words within a sentence. The choice between them is typically related to their function in describing location, time, or certain situations. a) Location: \\"In\\": It is generally used to express that something is enclosed or contained within something else, or to describe an area or space. Examples: - The book is in the bag. - I live in New York. - The key is in the drawer. \\"On\\": It usually indicates that something is above or touching a surface or object, describing a position or point on a surface. Examples: - The painting is on the wall. - She left her glasses on the table. - They are standing on the bridge. b) Time: \\"In\\": It is used to refer to a broader period of time, such as months, years, seasons, or parts of the day. Examples: - I will see you in September. - They got married in 2010. - I like to read in the evening. \\"On\\": This preposition is used more specifically to indicate days or dates. Examples: - The meeting is scheduled on Tuesday. - My birthday is on the 15th of June. 2. Difference between \\"will\\" and \\"would\\": \\"Will\\" and \\"would\\" are auxiliary verbs that primarily express future actions, intentions, or possibilities. They are used to talk about future events, make conditional statements, requests, and offer promises. a) \\"Will\\": This auxiliary verb is used to indicate future actions, declarations, or intentions. It is also the standard auxiliary for forming the future tense in English. Examples: - I will call you tomorrow. - They will arrive at 9 am. - She will start the new job on Monday. b) \\"Would\\": It acts as the past form of \\"will\\" and is often used to suggest hypothetical, unlikely, imaginary, or conditional situations, as well as being used to express politeness in requests. Examples: - I would go to the party if I weren't sick. (conditional) - She would have finished her homework if her computer hadn't broken down. (hypothetical) - Would you please close the window? (polite request) - When we were young, we would play soccer every weekend. (past habit) Now, to address your last question: \\"Do those questions have the same meaning?\\" No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to the difference between the prepositions \\"in\\" and \\"on\\", while the second question refers to the distinction between the auxiliary verbs \\"will\\" and \\"would\\".

Choose your answer from: 1). ashamed of my parents; 2). bored and sleepy; 3). proud of himself; Answer:","output":"Based on the information you provided, it seems that Robin is expressing a genuine interest in potentially marrying you in the future. This indicates that he sees a long-term relationship with you as something to aspire to and values the connection you both share. With this context, let's examine each of the possible reactions and determine the most likely one: 1). Ashamed of my parents: There is no information given to suggest that Robin feels ashamed of your parents. Robin shared his desire to marry you with them, which implies that he respects them and was comfortable enough to discuss this significant matter with them. It's unlikely that Robin would feel ashamed of your parents after this gesture. 2). Bored and sleepy: Robin's intention to marry you someday suggests that he is excited about the future possibilities of the relationship. This feeling is not typically associated with boredom or sleepiness. It's unlikely that Robin would feel bored and sleepy after expressing such a meaningful sentiment to your parents. 3). Proud of himself: Out of the three given options, feeling proud of himself seems like the most fitting reaction for Robin after expressing his intention to marry you someday. By sharing this with your parents, he is demonstrating courage and commitment, both of which can evoke a feeling of pride. Additionally, he might feel happy and encouraged if your parents provided a supportive response. This could further increase his sense of pride and satisfaction with his decision to share his intentions with them. So, in conclusion, it's most reasonable to assume that Robin would feel proud of himself for expressing his interest in marrying you someday to your parents. This pride may originate from his bravery in discussing such a significant matter with them and also because he values the relationship you share and its potential future."},{"instruction":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the original name of the place that was named Hotel Frances in 1925?, using the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

Given equation is: 69*z = 523*z + 9080 Step 1: The first step is to isolate the variable z on one side of the equation. In this case, let's subtract 523*z from both sides. 69z - 523z = 523z + 9080 - 523z Which simplifies into: -454z = 9080 Step 2: Once the z terms are consolidated, the next step is to isolate z completely. Do this by dividing every term by -454.  So,  (-454z) / -454 = 9080 / -454 Which simplifies into: z = -20 So, the solution for the equation 69*z = 523*z + 9080 is z = -20.

Movie plot title: Run Lola Run Movie plot: The movie opens with a series of questions about humanity and what we know to be true. After the credits, the camera zooms into a house and stops at a ringing telephone. Lola picks up and begins talking to Manni. Manni is in a telephone booth and questions her about where she has been since she was supposed to be waiting for him at the spot they had planned on. She tells him some guy stole the moped she was on while she was in the store and that it happened so fast she couldn't catch up to him. Manni begins to cry. He tells Lola that he made a big mistake and claims they're going to kill him. Lola asks him what happened and he begins to recollect the events. He says everything was going as planned; the car transactions went well, he got the diamonds he needed and crossed the border successfully, his encounter with a dealer went well, and he got the money he needed: 100,000 marks. All that was missing was her waiting for him at the spot. He walked to the train station and got on, but a bum bumped into him and fell. He helped the bum up, but two security guards got on the train. On instinct, he got off leaving the bag of money on the seat. He did not realize it until a minute or two later. He tried to go back to get the money but was stopped by the two security guards. The train left with the bag of money and the bum opened it, immediately grabbing it for himself. Manni tells Lola he would not be in this situation if she had been there on time. He blames her for being so sensitive and for believing love can solve anything. He tells her to come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes because that is all the time he has left before he has to meet Ronnie, his boss, and turn in the money or else he will kill him. He begins to tell her that over and over again until Lola screams \\"Stop\\" so loud, a few glasses on her TV set break. She finally tells him that she will come up with something in twenty minutes.

Options: - accomplish - notoriety - hellfire - learn about - religion","output":"The option that is most in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"What are mission workers constantly telling many people about?\\" is religion. Mission workers, often associated with religious organizations, are dedicated to spreading their faith and religious teachings to others. Their primary goal is to educate, support, and provide spiritual guidance to the communities they serve. Religion plays a vital role in the lives of many individuals, and mission workers aim to share their beliefs with others in the hope of providing a deeper understanding of their faith. Mission workers may belong to various religious denominations, such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism, but the core objective remains the same: to spread the teachings and principles of their respective faiths. Mission workers engage in various activities, such as: 1. Evangelism: They engage in spreading the message of their religion and converting others to their faith. 2. Education: Mission workers often participate in teaching the religious tenets, scriptures, and principles to both new and existing followers. 3. Community Service: They contribute to the well-being of communities by offering support and assistance in areas such as healthcare, education, and housing. 4. Disaster Relief: In times of crisis, mission workers provide aid and support to those affected by natural disasters or conflict situations. 5. Cultural Exchange: They encourage and facilitate interfaith dialogue, promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect among different religious groups. It is important to note that while some of the other options listed, such as \\"learn about\\" or \\"accomplish,\\" might be related to the work mission workers do, these terms do not encompass the broader scope of their activities and objectives.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer? from the following article ?  As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music....

Article: One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up: \\"And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?\\" Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Anthony Bond. PUBLISHED:. 06:42 EST, 6 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 09:17 EST, 6 November 2012. A charity worker has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work. George Maccoy also claimed to have completed 25 years in the RAF, but documentation suggested he had only completed 16 days before buying himself out without completing his basic training. He was employed as a ‘meeter and greeter’ at Corporation of Trinity House, a 500-year-old charity based in Newcastle which helps to care for mariners and their dependents. Disgraceful: George Maccoy, 60, has been exposed as a serial fantasist after he lied about having cancer so that he could take time off work. While he was employed, he claimed he had testicular cancer and forged letters from an imaginary consultant to justify taking time off work for fictitious hospital appointments. The charity had sacked the 60-year-old for nine counts of gross misconduct which included running-up up a 'considerable bill' by calling a dating agency on the handyman’s phone, the tribunal was told. But Mr Maccoy claimed he had been unfairly dismissed when the breakdown of a relationship triggered an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder which his managers failed to deal with. But his case was withdrawn and the tribunal was shown paperwork stating the 60-year-old served just 16 days in the RAF in 1979 without having completed his basic training. And in a rare move by the tribunal panel, Mr Maccoy was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs after a second claim for disability discrimination was withdrawn in June this year. Mr Maccoy was employed by Master, Pilots and Seamen of the Corporation of Trinity House, where he worked as a 'meeter and greeter' attending to VIPs and guests at the charity’s functions. Fantasist: George Maccoy was employed as a 'meeter and greeter' at a 500-year-old charity. But the organisation, which helps support poor mariners as well as examining and licensing deep sea shipping pilots, dismissed him in May last year after it was discovered that he had lied about suffering from cancer. Mr Maccoy had used a work printer to write letters from medical experts in which he lied about suffering from testicular cancer, the tribunal was told. He lost his £8-an-hour job after colleagues discovered the forged letter from fictitious consultant oncologist Simon Carter, a character created by Mr Maccoy to justify taking time off work to attend appointments, it was said. In February Mr Maccoy - who has spoken publicly about his battle to deal with the demons of war - launched a damages claim for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. But a legal team from Eversheds, led by senior associate Stephen Cairns, refuted the claims and in April they produced a letter from the RAF which said Mr Maccoy enlisted on March 21, 1972, but bought himself out just 16 days later on April 6. It is unclear if Mr Maccoy subsequently served in other parts of the armed forces or whether he saw action on foreign soil. It is believed that he was a member of the Territorial Army at some point. But Mr Cairns produced evidence at the tribunal which suggested Mr Maccoy had been working in South Tyneside as a caretaker during the 1990s when he claimed to be a serving aircraftsman. A spokeswoman for Trinity House said: 'The Newcastle Trinity House is pleased with the outcome of this employment tribunal which makes clear that all Mr Maccoy’s claims were completely untrue. 'We are, however, both deeply shocked and saddened that Mr Maccoy invented a past history with the RAF and moreover that he chose to fabricate post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of combat experience. 'We feel such deception is not only disturbing but also demeaning to all those genuine victims from our armed forces.' Mr Maccoy refused to comment following the tribunal but in a claim submitted to the tribunal, Mr Maccoy said: 'I was dismissed from my employment for alleged gross misconduct. 'At that time and presently I was/am suffering severe depression, also severe PTSD causing me to suffer loss of intellectual and social functions, whilst striving to hold down full-time employment.'

He told his workplace that he had cancer so he could take time off of work but it was not true. 3. He used a printer at work to make fake letters from a doctor that he made up. 4. George also said that he had worked in the RAF, a big group that helps the UK stay safe, for 25 years, but that was not true either. He only worked there for 16 days a long time ago in 1979. 5.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Combine the \\"r\\" terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Move all \\"r\\" terms to one side and the numbers to the other side. 3. Divide to find the value of \\"r\\". Let's do each step slowly: 1. We have three \\"r\\" terms: 116*r, -376*r, and -59*r.  We combine -376*r and -59*r first: -376 - 59 = -435. Now, we have 116*r on one side and -435*r on the other side. 2. Move all \\"r\\" terms to one side:  To do this, you can add 435*r to both sides of the equation. 116*r + 435*r - 9918 = -435*r + 435*r (-9918 remains on the left side) Now, we need to add 116*r and 435*r: 116 + 435 = 551. So, we get: 551*r - 9918 = 0 3. Move -9918 to the other side by adding 9918 to both sides: 551*r = 9918 Now, let's divide by 551 to find the value of \\"r\\": r = 9918 ÷ 551 When we do the division, we find that r = 18.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: While Dave Peverett is best known as the original lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of Foghat, what is Eicca Toppinen best known for? A:","output":"Eicca Toppinen is primarily recognized and renowned for being the lead cellist, composer, and founding member of the Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica. Born in Helsinki, Finland, on August 5, 1965, Toppinen started playing the cello at a very young age and demonstrated outstanding talent in music composition and performance. Unlike Dave Peverett, Toppinen followed a different musical path focused more on the interplay of classical and heavy metal music. Having chosen the cello as his signature music instrument, he essentially created a unique blend of music that sought an equilibrium point between two seemingly disparate music genres. Apocalyptica was formed during his time at the Sibelius Academy of Music in Helsinki in 1993 where he and three other cellists – Paavo Lötjönen, Max Lilja, and Perttu Kivilaakso – decided to perform Metallica songs on their cellos for fun. Their debut performance was in 1995 where Eicca played Metallica covers. This eventually led to the band's first album, \\"Plays Metallica by Four Cellos\\" in 1996. The album was highly successful and marked a new form of instrumental music that was warmly received by fans globally. This success played a significant role in shaping Toppinen's future career as a music artist in the symphonic metal genre. Eicca Toppinen stands out not only as an extraordinary cellist but also as a versatile music composer. He has contributed extensively to the music industry resulting in several album releases, numerous live performances, successful tours, and many collaborations with prominent figures within both the classical and contemporary music industry. His elaborate combination of traditional symphony elements and rock beats gives Apocalyptica a unique sound that distinguishes them from other bands.  The cello, under Toppinen's skillful manipulation, gains a particular aesthetic that transcends the traditional bounds of classical string music. This approach allows the cello to seamlessly infuse with heavy metal rhythms, pushing beyond its usual orchestral role and into an instrument capable of more dramatic and dynamic expressivity. Therefore, Eicca Toppinen, through his mastery and innovative approach to music, finds a way to blend and harmonize such different music styles, challenging the traditional norms and structures of music genres. In conclusion, Eicca Toppinen is best known as an innovative cellist and composer for the Finnish symphonic metal band Apocalyptica. His major contribution is largely tied to his unique craft of blending classical cello music and heavy metal to create a distinct brand of symphonic metal that has contributed immensely to the diversification of contemporary music worldwide. While his journey differs from that of Dave Peverett, they both have distinct elements that define their musicianship and contribute uniquely to the world of music."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Senators Returning With Little Urgency as Fiscal Clock Ticks WASHINGTON — President Obama and members of the Senate are set to return to Washington on Thursday to make a last-ditch effort at a deal to avert more than a half-trillion dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts just five days before they start kicking in. Even with so much at stake, there appeared to be little sense of urgency. Senate aides say most senators are not likely to be back on Capitol Hill before Thursday evening. And while the House may technically be in session, Republican leaders told members last week they would be given a 48-hour notice before they should return, and that notice has not yet been given. Senate Democratic and Republican leaders have also not talked in days, according to aides on both sides. But lawmakers continue to say a deal is possible to avert the “fiscal cliff,” when taxes leap to Clinton-era rates on Jan. 1 and 100 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs kick in the next day. “Nobody wants to go over this fiscal cliff. It will damage our economy. It will hurt every taxpayer. It will be the largest tax increase in history, affect everybody,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, warned on CNN on Wednesday. “And anyone who’s watching who thinks, oh, this isn’t going to impact me, you will find out that it will.” Congressional aides involved in the negotiations say the prospects for a deal dimmed considerably after the debacle in the House last Thursday, when Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio could not muster the votes for legislation to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts for income below 1 million a year. With his “Plan B” in tatters, Mr. Boehner met privately with House Republicans last Thursday night, delivered the Serenity Prayer, and declared it up to the Senate now to find a way forward. But publicly, leaders in the Senate are just as far apart. Senate Republican leaders say President Obama should press Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to take up legislation passed by the House that would extend all of the Bush tax cuts for a year, and another House bill that would cancel 50 billion in military cuts and shift those cuts onto domestic programs. Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid have repeatedly said that will never happen. Since the president signed legislation in late 2010 extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for two years, he has never strayed from his vow to veto any legislation that extends them again for affluent households. The president and the Senate majority leader want the Senate to take up legislation it has already passed to extend the tax cuts on income below 250,000, and attach an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a provision to temporarily suspend the budget cuts while talks on a larger deficit reduction deal continue next year. But Democrats say they will move forward only if Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, can assure that either the bill can pass with a simple majority or that he will not press Republicans to vote against it on a 60-vote threshold. The leader’s spokesman, Don Stewart, said he could offer no such assurances. Besides, Mr. Stewart said from the Capitol, there has been “no outreach from Democrats, here or from the White House” to formally make such a request. Still, Democrats do appear to be readying for one last push. Steps were being taken in Hawaii to name a new senator as early as Wednesday to fill the seat of Daniel Inouye, whose funeral was on Sunday. A quick decision by Gov. Neal Abercrombie, a Democrat, to fill the seat could provide Democrats with a needed vote. Before his death, Mr. Inouye wrote the governor and recommended that Representative Colleen Hanabusa be named his successor. Tulsi Gabbard, who was elected to the House in November, is openly campaigning for the Senate post even before she is sworn in to the lower chamber. Despite the imminent return of the Senate, many lawmakers now say no deal will be made until after the deadline. On Jan. 3, Mr. Boehner is likely to be re-elected speaker for the 113th Congress. After that roll call, he may feel less pressure from his right flank against a deal. For its part, the Senate may simply be out of time. Without unanimous agreement, Mr. Reid would have to call up a deal and file for a vote just to take it up. He could then be forced to press for another vote to cut off debate before final passage. If forced to jump through all those hoops, the 112th Senate could expire before the final votes could be cast. “I think there’s some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January, which technically means you’re going over the cliff,” Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNBC on Wednesday morning. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about how the President and the Senate are trying to make a deal to stop big changes in taxes and money spent by the government. These changes could hurt the economy and affect many people. They only have a few days to make this deal, but everyone does not seem to be in a hurry. They are trying to find a way to agree on how to handle taxes and the spending on different programs. If they cannot find a solution in time, there can be a lot of problems for the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Now that things have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a coffee filter is made of thicker paper happens, how will it affect less coffee makes it through the filter.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a coffee filter made of thicker paper does indeed have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Here's a step-by-step justification of the impact: 1. Direct effect: Using a thicker paper filter will potentially slow down the flow of water through the coffee grounds. This is because the increased thickness of the paper creates more resistance for the water to pass through. 2. Flavor extraction: As a result of the slower water flow, there might be a change in how efficiently flavors are extracted from the coffee grounds. On one hand, longer contact time between water and grounds could result in over-extraction, which might lead to a bitter tasting coffee. On the other hand, if the flow is too slow, there might be an incomplete extraction, which could result in a weak or flat-tasting coffee. 3. Indirect effect: The slower flow of water through a thicker filter could make the process itself longer, meaning that it would take more time to brew a pot of coffee. This could have implications on the overall user experience and satisfaction with the coffee-making process. 4. Clogging issues: A thicker paper filter may be more prone to clogging, depending on the quality of the paper and the size of the coffee grounds. This could lead to the need for more frequent filter replacements or could even cause issues with the coffee maker's infrastructure and long-term functioning. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis regarding the use of a thicker paper filter does have an effect on the coffee-making process. The potential impacts involve changes to the speed of the brewing process, extraction efficiency and flavor, user experience, and coffee maker maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Do you have any strong opinion on co-educational or single-sex schools?        A supporter of co-educational schools would probably say that schools should be like the societies they belong to .In Hong Kong , men and women mix socially on a day-to-day basis .In many fields men are even likely to have female bosses .It is ,therefore, desirable that boys and girls grow up together ,go to school together ,and prepare themselves for a society that does not value sexual separation.        Some would go on to argue further that growing up with members of the opposite sex is important for personal development .Regular contact can remove the strange ideas about the opposite-sex and lead to more natural relationships .Single-sex conditions are seen as leading to more extreme opinions, and possibly even as encouraging homosexuality ,though there is no proof that this is the case.        Those who are against coeducation often also fix their attention on the sexual side .Some parents fear that close contact with members of the opposite sex is dangerous for teenagers .They want their children to be attentive to their studies .Such parents feel uncomfortable with modern ways and the free mixing of the sexes.        A stronger argument comes from research into school results .Girls grow up earlier than boys ,tend to be more orderly and are likely to be better at languages .In a mixed class ,boys who might do well in a single-sex class become discouraged and take on the rule of troublemaker .Certainly in the UK this situation has greatly alarmed the government for it to be encouraging co-educational schools to have some single-sex classes .In the UK the best schools are all single-sex ,strongly suggesting that co-education is not the best answer .This may ,however ,not be as simple as it looks .It may simply be that the famous old schools that attract the best students happen to be single-sex ,rather than that being single-sex makes them better schools.

The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some \\"spartan\\" relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result \\"thin\\" and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers.
