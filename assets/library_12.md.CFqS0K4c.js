Passage: In 1929, the university's fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; the university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into its current[when?] four divisions. In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university. During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the University of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students. Also, the Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.

The passage describes various changes that happened during his tenure, and you are asked to determine if the question regarding his tenure can be answered using the given passage. Question: What did the university undergo during Hutchins 33-year tenure? First, let's identify the guidelines provided in the passage: 1. Hutchins eliminated varsity football to emphasize academics over athletics. 2. He instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core. 3. He organized the university's graduate work into its current four divisions. 4. Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. 5. The University of Chicago Hospitals finished construction and enrolled its first medical students during his tenure. 6. The Committee on Social Thought was created during his term. Now, let's analyze the question. The question asks about the changes the university underwent during Hutchins' 33-year tenure. However, the passage states that his tenure lasted for 24 years, not 33. This discrepancy means we cannot accurately answer the question based on the information provided in the passage. Therefore, following the guidelines mentioned in the task, the output should be 'False' as the information in the passage is not sufficient to answer the question accurately."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.  After reading the above, is \\"That more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What problem did Barnes understand before he became governor?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the text, Gov. Roy Barnes understood the problem that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance before he became governor. This issue relates to the inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system for millions of Americans too poor to afford legal representation and the limited availability of legal help for eligible clients."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What are the types of whales that use throat pleats to expand the mouth? is inside the article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., can you guess it ?

Captain America: Civil War sees your favorite Marvel superheroes (almost literally every one) clash over whether their actions should be supervised by the UN following a mission gone wrong. Critics and audiences alike are impressed, according to Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: It's a \\"hugely entertaining … comic book extravaganza\\" that boasts a \\"quicksilver mix of hardcore action and bright comedy,\\" writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. It helps that the plot \\"makes consistent sense,\\" which isn't always the case with such flicks. Tom Holland's appearance as Spider-Man also spells good things for the future of the genre. \\"It's basically a third Avengers film, and creatively the best of the bunch,\\" writes Brian Lowry at CNN. The film's scope \\"marks a significant departure from the genre's past,\\" but it manages to tease multiple new characters \\"without losing its focus—and more significantly, its sense of fun.\\" The ending, however, is \\"a trifle messy, and rushed.\\" While Batman v Superman was a \\"dour and dark … excuse for spectacle,\\" Civil War is \\"colorful and fun\\" and \\"rooted in character and emotion,\\" writes Jamelle Bouie at Slate.

It's like a huge play fight between all your favorite Marvel superheroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and even Spider-Man! So, imagine if your toys were on an adventure and accidentally broke a few other toys? Would they need someone to watch them? That's the problem in the movie. After a mission goes wrong, it's asked if superheroes should have someone looking over their actions, like a grown-up watches you. Some superheroes think it's a good idea, and some don't - thus the play fight begins. People who watch a lot of movies (they're called critics) and regular folks who like to watch movies (audiences) thought this movie was really good.  Joe from the Wall Street Journal says it's like a big, fun party with your favorite comic book characters. There's lots of action (think about when your toys do daring stunts and cool moves) mixed with comedy (which means lots of laughing). Plus, everything that happens in the story makes sense, which doesn't always happen in superhero movies. And hey, Spider-Man shows up too, which many think is very cool! And guess what?

Look for an option that says \\"Pop-ups and redirects.\\" Tap on it to open a new page that shows the words \\"Pop-ups and redirects\\" at the top. Step 6: Switch off Pop-ups and Redirects Next to the words \\"Pop-ups and redirects,\\" you will see a little switch. It might look like a circle or a rectangle. If the switch is blue, that means pop-ups and redirects are allowed. But we don't want that! So, tap on the switch to turn it off. Now it should be gray. Great job! Step 7: Go back to the Site Settings Menu Now, we need to go back to the \\"Site Settings\\" menu. To do this, tap the back arrow at the top-left corner of your screen. It looks like this: . Step 8: Tap on Ads In the \\"Site Settings\\" menu, look for an option that says \\"Ads.\\" Tap on it to open a new page that shows the word \\"Ads\\" at the top. Step 9: Switch off Ads Just like we did for pop-ups and redirects, we need to turn off ads. Again, if the switch next to the word \\"Ads\\" is blue, tap on it to turn it off. It should be gray when you're done. Congratulations, Little Explorer! You did it! Now you can enjoy using Google Chrome without those annoying pop-ups and ads getting in the way of your fun.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  blackhole  for the following movie plot:  In the year 2058, Earth will soon be uninhabitable due to irreversible effects of pollution. The United Global Space Force prepares the first launch for the colonization of a distant planet much like our own. Meanwhile, a terrorist group called the Global Sedition wants to interrupt the colonization to be able to take over the same planet themselves. Professor John Robinson, lead scientist of the Jupiter Mission, prepares to take his wife Maureen, daughters Judy and Penny and son Will on a 10-year mission in suspended animation to the nearby planet Alpha Prime, where they will build a companion \\"hypergate\\" to the one orbiting Earth. The project is accelerated after Sedition terrorists attack Earth's hypergate, but are stopped by fighter pilots, one of whom is Major Don West. When the pilot for the Jupiter Mission is murdered, West is assigned as his replacement. Dr. Zachary Smith, a spy employed by the Sedition, reprograms the mission's robot to destroy the ship. He is betrayed, though, by his employers and left as an unwilling stowaway when the Jupiter II blasts off. A few hours after launch, the robot activates and starts destroying vital ship and navigation controls. The Robinsons, awakened from their cryosleep by Dr. Smith, stop the robot, but not before it causes the ship to become trapped in the gravitational pull of the Sun. Their only option to escape the gravity well would be to use the hyperdrive and end up anywhere in the galaxy. Now lost, the ship eventually comes across a \\"hole in space\\" and, after entering, finds a planet with two abandoned ships in orbit; the Proteus, an Earth ship somehow from decades in the future, and another ship that is clearly not human. When they investigate the Proteus they find navigational data that can be used to get to Alpha Prime (suggesting that humanity has somehow settled on Alpha Prime without the Robinsons) and a young alien primate that they adopt as a pet. They also find the aging ship is infested with carnivorous spider-like lifeforms, with the leg of one...

A sperm and egg meet inside a woman's fallopian tube: Age might affect the quality of a woman's eggs, but this step in the process does not directly involve the uterus. 2. The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus: Again, age might affect the quality of the egg, but the uterus is not involved in this step. 3. The zygote implants in the uterus: Age could affect the uterus's ability to support implantation, possibly due to a thinner uterine lining or a decrease in blood supply to the uterus. This might result in lower chances of a successful pregnancy. 4. The zygote becomes an embryo, the embryo becomes a fetus, and the fetus grows for approximately 9 months: Age could increase the risk of pregnancy complications, including those related to the uterus, which might result in a higher likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature birth. 5. The woman gives birth to a baby: An older uterus might have decreased strength and elasticity, potentially affecting the ease and safety of delivery (i.e., increased risk of complications). Given this analysis, an older and potentially less healthy uterus could lead to a higher likelihood of unsuccessful implantation, pregnancy complications, or delivery issues, all of which could contribute to a woman having fewer babies. Therefore, the answer is B: less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake.  However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger.   We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was. It must have been over 45 minutes though, and the manager came out to apologize and reassure us that the burgers were coming right away. When we got our check, the prices of the burgers were subtracted from the total so we basically got them for free. I was floored by the manager's gesture and the great customer service.

Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll decides to pass the time by attending the coronation of his distant relation, King Rudolf V of Ruritania (also played by Stone) . He encounters an acquaintance on the train there, Antoinette de Mauban, the mistress of the king's treacherous brother, Grand Duke 'Black' Michael. The day before the coronation, Rassendyll is seen by Colonel Sapt and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim. Astounded by the uncanny resemblance between Rassendyll and their liege, they take him to meet Rudolf at a hunting lodge. The king is delighted with his double and invites him to dinner. During the meal, a servant brings in a fine bottle of wine, a present from Michael delivered by his henchman, Rupert of Hentzau. After Rudolf tastes it, he finds it so irresistible that he drinks the entire bottle by himself. The next morning, Sapt is unable to rouse him; the wine was drugged. Sapt is afraid that if the coronation is postponed, Michael will seize the throne. The country is dangerously divided between the supporters of Rudolf and of Michael. The colonel declares that it is Fate that brought Rassendyll to Ruritania; he can take Rudolf's place with no one the wiser. The Englishman is less certain, but he tosses a coin, which lands in Rudolf's favor, and Rassendyll goes through with the ceremony. Afterwards, he is driven to the palace in the company of the universally adored Princess Flavia.

Men are in a line in a bycicle in a competition. men","output":"In a bicycle competition, men are lined up and ready to race. What most naturally follows is the series of events and processes that take place during a typical bicycle race competition. Let's break it down into various stages and aspects of the race: 1. Pre-race preparations: Prior to the start of the competition, participants would have completed their registration process and collected their race numbers. They will have also checked their bikes to ensure that they are in good working order and complied with any equipment regulations. The race organizers would have set up the race course, including markings and safety measures, such as placing barriers, marshals, and first aid stations along the route. 2. Strategies and planning: Riders and their teams would have developed race strategies tailored to the specific conditions of the competition, such as the route, weather, terrain, and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Some riders may aim to go for an early breakaway, while others may want to ride in the peloton (main group) and conserve energy for a sprint finish. 3. The starting line: Riders would have warmed up and assembled at the starting line, prepared to begin the race. The race official would make any last-minute announcements, and the countdown to the start will commence. Once the starting gun or whistle is sounded, the race begins. 4. The race: Throughout the race, individual riders and teams will contend for positions and may attempt to break away from the main group to gain an advantage. Each rider's performance during the race will be determined by their tactical decision-making, physical fitness, ability to handle their bicycle in various terrain types, and their ability to navigate the race course efficiently. 5. Aid stations and support vehicles: Along the race route, riders may need to stop at aid stations or receive support from team vehicles if they require mechanical assistance, water, or nourishment. Race marshals and officials may provide assistance and enforce race rules along the route as well. 6. Finish line: As racers approach the finish line, some might sprint to try to get ahead of their competitors, while others may be simply focused on completing the race. The winner of the race will be the first one to cross the finish line, and the subsequent racers will have their position in the competition determined based on the order of their arrival. 7. Results and celebrations: After the race, the official results will be calculated, including the winners for any race categories, such as age groups or gender-based classifications. The awarding ceremonies will follow, where winners and those who placed on the podium receive their medals or trophies. Post-race celebrations and festivities are common, allowing racers and supporters an opportunity to socialize, discuss race strategies and experiences, share achievements, and enjoy food and refreshments. Overall, what most naturally follows the men's bicycle race competition are the exciting and challenging events taking place during the race, as well as the post-race gatherings and celebrations. Races bring together individuals and communities, showcasing the spirit of sportsmanship, camaraderie, and passion for cycling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Besides happiness, what contradictory meaning does China ascribe to green?","output":"In Chinese culture, green is primarily seen as a symbol of fertility and happiness. However, it may also have a contradictory meaning associated with infidelity. This negative connotation may not be as prevalent or widely recognized as the positive associations of fertility and happiness, but it is present in some aspects of Chinese culture, particularly in literature and idioms. For example, a well-known Chinese expression, \\"wearing a green hat\\" (戴绿帽子 or dài lǜ màozi), symbolizes a man whose wife or partner is unfaithful. The origin of this phrase can be traced back to the Yuan dynasty, when the families of prostitutes were required to wear green clothing and accessories.  Another example is the classic Chinese novel \\"Dream of the Red Chamber,\\" where one of the main characters, Jia Baoyu, describes the jealousy caused by suspicion of infidelity as \\"green plums simmering in a golden pot\\" (金炉绿梅 or jīnlú lǜméi). The negative context of jealousy and infidelity links the color green with these unwanted feelings and circumstances in this literary context. Despite these negative associations, it is essential to note that different cultures interpret colors differently, and the positive symbolism of green as a representation of fertility, happiness, and overall optimism remains the more dominant aspect in Chinese culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Nintendo Entertainment System: The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". What was the lockout chip number for UK, Italy, and Australia?","output":"The lockout chip number for the UK, Italy, and Australia was 3197.

Given the question: Given the background: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.  and the situation: Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41.  Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in. When Adam and him play games together Chris also seems to lose more often now even though historically he has always been better.  Answer the following question: Which brother is likely experiencing a decline in strength, Adam or Chris? The answer is:","output":"Chris is likely experiencing a decline in strength. Step 1: Identify the ages of Adam and Chris - Adam is 27, and Chris is 41. Step 2: Determine which life stage they belong to - According to the background, middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. Adam is still in his late 20s, not yet in middle adulthood, while Chris is in his early 40s, fitting within the middle adulthood stage. Step 3: Analyze the physical signs and declining abilities mentioned in the background - It's stated that in middle adulthood, people start showing physical signs of aging (such as gray hair) and their strength, reaction time, and vision may begin to decline. Step 4: Compare this information to the situation - Chris is showing signs of aging (gray hair) and experiencing a decline in his performance at games, which could indicate a decline in strength, reaction time, and/or other age-related factors.

For example, a wind blows a storm over your school. Where is that storm coming from? Where is it going? How can we describe a direction? The most common way is by using a compass. A compass is a device with a floating needle (Figure 2.1). The needle is a small magnet. The needle aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle always points to magnetic north. If you have a compass and you find north. You can then know any other direction. See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose. The Earth has two poles. It has a magnetic north pole. It also has a geographic north pole. These two poles are close to each other but not the exact same place.  Do you have any questions?","output":"A compass is an essential tool for finding direction, as it allows us to orient ourselves based on the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle, which acts like a small magnet, aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing to the magnetic north. By finding the north, you can then determine other directions such as east, south, and west using the compass rose. The Earth has two poles: the magnetic north pole and the geographic north pole. Although they are close to each other, they are not in the exact same location. The magnetic north pole is the point on the Earth where the planet's magnetic field points directly downwards, while the geographic north pole is the northernmost point of the Earth's axis of rotation. To describe direction, we can use the cardinal points on a compass rose: north, south, east, and west. We can further refine these directions by using intermediate cardinal points (or ordinal directions), which are the points between the cardinal points. These ordinal directions are northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. Additionally, we can describe a direction in terms of its angle, known as its bearing or azimuth, relative to true north or magnetic north. For instance, in the example of a storm approaching a school, we can use a compass to identify the direction from which it is coming and where it is headed. By observing the compass rose, we can deduce if the storm is moving from the north, east, west, or south or any of the intermediate directions. This information can help us make decisions about our actions to stay safe and plan accordingly. In conclusion, a compass is a valuable instrument in determining direction, using the Earth's magnetic field as a reference. By understanding the compass rose and cardinal points, we can describe direction accurately and make informed decisions based on the location and movement of objects, like the storm in the given example."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a United States labor law that entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specific family and medical reasons. The goal of this act is to help employees balance their work life and family commitments, ensuring they don't suffer adverse consequences in their employment for taking time off due to qualified reasons. Under the FMLA, eligible employees can take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following reasons: 1. Personal illness: If the employee has a serious health condition that requires time off from work for receiving medical care, treatment or recovery, they may take FMLA leave. 2. Family illness: If an employee's immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) has a serious health condition that requires the employee's care and support, FMLA leave can be used to provide such care. 3. Family military leave: FMLA leave can be used when an employee's spouse, child, or parent is on active duty (or being called to active duty) in the Armed Forces, which necessitates the employee's time off to manage family affairs and related exigencies. 4. Pregnancy: Employees can use FMLA leave for prenatal care, incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum recovery. 5. Adoption: If an employee is adopting a child or initiating the process of adoption, they may take FMLA leave to attend appointments, complete legal requirements, and bond with the newly adopted child. 6. Foster care placement: FMLA leave is also available for employees who are undergoing the process of placing a child in their care as foster parents. This could include attending appointments, legal proceedings, and the initial bonding period. In summary, the FMLA was enacted to protect employees' rights to take time off for specific medical and family reasons without jeopardizing their job security. By understanding the various qualified reasons for which FMLA leave can be taken, employees and employers can work together to support a healthy balance between work and personal life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a comprehensive guide on how to grow and maintain a garden that suits your preferences and conditions. 1. Assess your space and location: Determine the size of the garden area and its location in your property. Consider the amount of sunlight and shade it receives, as some plants require more sunlight than others. Also, think about the availability of water sources and the overall soil quality. 2. Research your plant choices: Identify the types of plants you would like to grow in your garden. Consider factors such as the plant's hardiness to the area, their ability to thrive in your soil type, and availability of sun and shade in your garden. 3. Design your garden layout: Plan the layout of your garden by accounting for the size and growth patterns of your chosen plants. Some plants may require more space or specific planting arrangements to thrive. It is also essential to consider how the colors, textures, and sizes of various plants will create a visually pleasing and cohesive design. 4. Prepare the soil: Test your soil to determine its pH level, nutrient content, and overall quality. Amend your soil based on the specific needs of your chosen plants, which may include adding organic matter, nutrients, or altering the pH level to create the optimal growing environment. 5.

However, as he approached the garage and attempted to park the vehicle inside, he quickly realized that the car was simply too large to fit through the garage doorway. He tried several angles, but it soon became apparent that there was just no way the car could squeeze into the garage. Bobby felt disheartened by this realization. He had never foreseen this issue when he had eagerly signed the papers and taken the keys from the dealership. In the midst of his excitement, he had overlooked the dimensions of his new SUV and never considered whether it would fit into his current garage. Determined to find a solution, Bobby decided to take a few measurements, comparing the size of his car with the garage. He discovered that the height and width of the SUV exceeded the dimensions of the garage door by several inches, rendering it impossible to get the car inside. Further inspection of the garage revealed that even if he could somehow get the car through the doorway, the garage's interior was just not spacious enough to accommodate the length of the SUV. This problem needed to be resolved urgently, as leaving his new car outside was not a viable long-term option. Bobby began exploring different solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each. The first idea was to modify the existing garage by enlarging the entrance and creating more interior space. This, however, would prove to be a complicated and expensive process involving extensive renovations and potential permit requirements. The next option Bobby considered was to purchase a larger, portable garage. This seemed more feasible, but would still result in additional costs. He also gave some thought to selling his new SUV and opting for a smaller, more garage-friendly vehicle. However, this alternative was quickly dismissed, as Bobby was not willing to part with the car he had worked so hard to acquire. After much thought, Bobby settled on building a new, larger garage that would comfortably house his new car. He contacted a contractor, who presented him with several design options, allowing him to choose the most efficient and aesthetically pleasing layout. Construction began in the following weeks, and Bobby felt a renewed sense of excitement as he watched the new garage take shape. He recognized that this setback had been a learning experience, reminding him of the importance of thorough planning and thinking ahead. Once the new garage was completed, Bobby was finally able to park his beloved SUV safely inside. He was relieved and satisfied, knowing that his car was now snugly tucked away from potential harm and the elements. The garage issue had been a significant bump in the road, but Bobby was proud of his ability to adapt and find a fitting solution. With his mind now at ease, Bobby was ready to fully enjoy his new SUV and embark on countless road trips and adventures with his luxurious, spacious companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"I shall go downtown.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"Yes, a linguist would generally rate the sentence \\"I shall go downtown.\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This sentence demonstrates multiple aspects of sentence structure and linguistic acceptability that make it appropriate for usage according to standard English grammar rules. 1. Subject-Verb Agreement: The sentence displays proper subject-verb agreement with the singular subject, \\"I,\\" being paired with the singular form of the verb, \\"shall go.\\" 2. Verb Tense: The verb tense of \\"shall go\\" implies that the speaker intends to take the action in the future, which is a crucial component of any language system's capacity to express temporal distinctions. Within English grammar, the use of \\"shall\\" with the first person pronoun is an older, more formal way to indicate future intention than the more modern and common usage of \\"will.\\" 3. Verb Modality: The word \\"shall\\" is a modal verb, which adds the nuance of necessity or obligation to the base verb, \\"go.\\" This introduces an additional layer of meaning to the sentence, lending a sense of certainty or commitment to the intended action of going downtown. 4. Proper Noun: \\"Downtown\\" is a proper noun typically referring to the central or commercial area of a city or town. It provides necessary geographical information and is a common and acceptable term in English. 5. Semantic Completeness: The sentence \\"I shall go downtown.\\" is semantically complete, as it contains a subject (I), an action (shall go), and a destination (downtown). Consequently, the sentence conveys a complete idea that can be understood by a native English speaker without needing further clarification. 6. Syntactic Structure: The sentence follows a standard English SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) syntactic structure. \\"I\\" is the subject, \\"shall go\\" is the verb phrase, and \\"downtown\\" functions as the object which receives the action. Taking these points into consideration, a linguist would classify the sentence \\"I shall go downtown\\" as linguistically acceptable and grammatically correct within the context of Standard English. However, it is important to note that language is always evolving, and different linguistic communities may exhibit variations in usage or priorities. Additionally, variations in formality and registers may impact the social acceptability of certain phrasings, but overall, this sentence does adhere to the established rules and principles that guide the English language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed—cooking more at home—does not appear to have a direct or indirect effect on the process of coastal erosion caused by ocean waves. The perturbation is focused on human behavior (cooking at home), while coastal erosion is a geological process driven by natural forces, such as waves, wind, and currents. It is worth noting that human activities can indirectly affect coastal erosion, such as construction projects near the coast or factors contributing to climate change, which may lead to sea-level rise and increased wave energy.

If Reviews of his four-hour Hamlet , with its unlikely cast (Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Charlton Heston), don't resolve the question., can we conclude that \\"The play was very well acted.\\"? Choose your answer from: [A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no;","output":"[B]. It is not possible to tell. Determining whether \\"The play was very well acted\\" based solely on the presence of an unlikely cast and mixed reviews is not sufficient for making a definitive conclusion. To draw a conclusion about the quality of the acting in the four-hour Hamlet production, numerous factors should be taken into consideration. 1. Cast Performance: The performance of the main actors, including Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, and Charlton Heston, needs to be critically evaluated. While it may be surprising that these actors were chosen for their roles in Hamlet, it is important to examine their portrayals of the individual characters to gauge the effectiveness of the casting decision. 2. Ensemble Performance: Alongside the main actors, the performances of the supporting cast members can also contribute significantly to the overall quality of the acting. Observing the chemistry between actors, the ability to portray emotions effectively, and the capacity to immerse themselves in the world of the play can give a better idea of whether the play was well acted as a whole. 3. Direction: The choices made by the director in terms of staging, pacing, and overall interpretation of the play can strongly influence the quality of the acting. If the director was able to guide the actors in delivering compelling, believable performances, it may lead to a well-acted play. 4. Review Content: When examining reviews of the play, it is important to consider specific comments about the acting abilities of the cast members. If the majority of reviews highlight exceptional acting skills from the actors, it could be inferred that the play was well acted. However, if reviews express concerns about the casting choices or lackluster performances, it might indicate that the acting was not up to par. 5. Audience Reception: The opinions of audience members who watched the production can be quite valuable in determining the quality of the acting. Crowd reactions and engagement during the performance, as well as post-show discussions, can give insight into the effectiveness of the acting in engaging and immersing the audience into the world of the play. Considering these factors, it is crucial to delve deeper into the aspects mentioned above to draw any conclusion about the quality of the acting in the four-hour Hamlet production. Merely relying on the unlikely cast and mixed reviews is not enough to make a definitive statement about whether the play was well acted or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  Which company made less fuel for airplanes? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Company A is involved in the refining and management of petroleum products which are used as fuel for various vehicles, including airplanes. On the other hand, Company H is involved in the production and distribution of electricity using wind power. Wind power is a renewable energy source that does not involve the production or use of traditional fuels like petroleum for transportation or aviation purposes. Given their respective operations and energy sources, it is evident that Company H made less fuel for airplanes as they are not involved in the production and supply of petroleum-based fuels. In contrast, Company A directly contributes to the creation and provision of airplane fuels through their refining and management of petroleum products.

This article: Leonard Harrison State Park is a 585-acre (237 ha) Pennsylvania state park in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is on the east rim of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, which is 800 feet (240 m) deep and nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 m) across here. It also serves as headquarters for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, its sister park on the west rim of the gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge, and offers hiking, fishing and hunting, whitewater boating, and camping. The park is in Shippen and Delmar Townships, 10 miles (16 km) west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660. Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek. The path was later used by lumbermen, and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988. Since 1996, the 63.4-mile (102.0 km) Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the park. The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area, while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River. The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which have been reintroduced to the area. Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is now covered by second growth forest, thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park is named for Leonard Harrison, a Wellsboro lumberman who cut the timber there, then established the park, which he donated to the state in 1922. The CCC improved the park and built many of its original facilities. Since a successful publicity campaign in 1936, the park has been a popular tourist destination and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Leonard Harrison State Park... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the place whose sister park is on the west rim of the gorge?, what is it ?

Koulutuksen alalla on jatkuvasti kehittyviä toimintatapoja, lähestymistapoja ja teorioita, mikä tarkoittaa, että aiemmin vähemmän huomioon otettuja tekijöitä voidaan tutkia ja arvostaa enemmän tulevaisuudessa. Nykyisessä globaalissa yhteiskunnassa koulutus on entistä tärkeämpää, sillä se antaa ihmisille tietoja, taitoja ja kompetensseja, jotka ovat välttämättömiä heidän menestykselleen ja hyvinvoinnilleen. Tämän vuoksi koulutukseen liittyviin aiheisiin ja niiden merkitykseen tulisi suhtautua vakavasti sekä pyrkiä edistämään niiden tunnustamista ja arvostusta. Yksi esimerkki sellaisesta alasta, joka on saanut vasta viime aikoina enemmän huomiota, on elinikäinen oppiminen. Se tarkoittaa sitä, että yksilöiden on jatkuvasti päivitettävä tietojaan ja taitojaan vastaamaan nykyisiä ja tulevia työmarkkinoita. Tällainen koulutusmalli auttaa varmistamaan, että ihmiset ovat joustavia, mukautuvat ja kykenevät kohtaamaan uusia haasteita sekä taloudellisella että henkilökohtaisella tasolla. Toinen esimerkki on kestävä kehitys ja sen integroiminen koulutukseen. Yhä useammat koulutusjärjestelmät maailmanlaajuisesti tunnistavat tarpeen opettaa oppilaille kestävän kehityksen periaatteita ja käytäntöjä, joihin kuuluu esimerkiksi ympäristönsuojelu, sosiaalinen oikeudenmukaisuus ja taloudellinen vakaus. Tämä auttaa valmistamaan nuoria sukupolvia kohtaamaan maailmanlaajuisia haasteita ja rakentamaan kestävämpiä ja vastuullisempia yhteiskuntia. Nämä kaksi esimerkkiä osoittavat, että koulutukseen liittyviä aiheita, joihin on aiemmin kiinnitetty vähemmän huomiota, voidaan nyt tunnustaa ja arvostaa enemmän. Samalla ne korostavat koulutuksen merkitystä yksilöiden ja yhteiskuntien hyvinvoinnin kannalta. Jos haluamme rakentaa parempia tulevaisuudennäkymiä koko maailmalle, meidän on jatkuvasti varmistettava, että koulutusjärjestelmät ja -käytännöt ovat ajan tasalla ja ottavat huomioon eri alat ja niiden tarpeet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"layers of fat.\\" The question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" can be answered by referring to the concept of Keystone species.  Keystone species are crucial organisms within an ecosystem that disproportionately contribute to the balance and stability of the entire system. These species typically play a critical role in maintaining essential interactions, such as predation and resource distribution among other organisms. The removal or loss of a keystone species can lead to significant shifts in the structure and function of an ecosystem, often causing cascading effects throughout the entire area. In the context of fish species, keystone species can serve as either a primary or secondary source of food. As primary food sources, these species directly provide sustenance to fish through grazing, predation, or scavenging activities. For example, certain types of plankton serve as food for small fish, which are then consumed by larger fish, establishing a vital food chain. Moreover, many fish and invertebrates serve critical roles as predators and prey, contributing to the stability and diversity of aquatic ecosystems. As secondary sources of food, keystone species influence fish survival by supporting the overall health and productivity of an environment. For instance, some fish depend on the presence of coral reefs, mangrove forests, or aquatic plants to provide crucial feeding, breeding, and sheltering opportunities. These habitats are often maintained by keystone species, such as parrotfish, which help keep algae under control, allowing corals to grow and remain healthy. In conclusion, keystone species are essential components of many ecosystems, providing food directly or indirectly to a variety of fish species. Although \\"layers of fat\\" might be a source of energy for some fish, it is not the correct answer to the question of what serves as a source of food for many fish species. Keystone species and their vital influence on aquatic ecosystems are the more accurate and precise answer to this question."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers? is inside the article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers is William Bruce. He was an influential Scottish architect and fell from favor during the accession of James VII in 1685.

In both sentences, the key subject is Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). The focus on Snowden and Russia is the main overlapping element between the two sentences. However, the first sentence, \\"Snowden asks to stay in Russia,\\" focuses on Snowden's request to remain in the country. This potentially refers to his application for temporary or permanent asylum, which was granted by the Russian government. The sentence emphasizes Snowden's desire to stay in the country and the legal process he needs to navigate. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Snowden releases first Russia video,\\" highlights Snowden's release of some form of content, most likely to the public or media. The \\"first Russia video\\" implies that there might be a series of videos or information released by Snowden with a specific focus on Russia. The main point in this sentence is Snowden's actions to share information rather than his stay in Russia. In conclusion, the two sentences share similar elements, such as the reference to Snowden and his connection with Russia. However, the main focus of each sentence is different, one emphasizing his request to stay in the country and the other highlighting the release of video content. Therefore, the meaning overlap is moderate, and I would rate the similarity as a 2.5 on the scale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to \\"save\\" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a \\"death squad\\" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. \\"I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,\\" he said at the airport. \\"I have come to save Pakistan.\\" Last week,","output":"Last week, Pervez Musharraf began rallying support and reaching out to his loyalists in a bid to reestablish his presence in Pakistan's political landscape. He has been holding meetings with key party leaders and members, discussing potential alliances and mapping out strategies to maximize his impact in the upcoming elections. Musharraf's return to Pakistan has resulted in a mixed response from the public, with some showing support for his commitment to restoring order in the country, while others condemn his past actions during his time in power and believe that he should face legal consequences for them. Despite the threats from the Taliban, Musharraf appears to be undeterred and determined to play an active role in shaping the future of Pakistan. He has called for unity amongst the different factions in the country, emphasizing the need for a stable and prosperous Pakistan. This sentiment has resonated with some Pakistanis who are disillusioned with the current state of the nation and believe that a strong, united front against corruption, extremism, and economic instability is necessary. In terms of policy, Musharraf's potential platform centers around key issues such as education reform, economic revitalization, counter-terrorism, and regional cooperation – all of which were focal points during his previous time in office. However, it remains to be seen whether he can regain the trust and support of the Pakistani people, given the various controversies that plagued his previous tenure. This includes the suspension of the constitution, the dismissal of the chief justice, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces on his watch. Musharraf's comeback attempt has also prompted discussions surrounding the role of the military in Pakistan's politics. During his time in power, Musharraf was often accused of undermining democratic institutions and consolidating power within the military establishment. Some political analysts argue that his return to the political arena could signal a resurgence of military influence in Pakistani politics, which may not bode well for the fragile democratic process in the country. Furthermore, by deciding to run for office, Musharraf knowingly puts himself at risk of facing the numerous criminal charges that await him, such as the high treason case related to the imposition of emergency rule in 2007. Nonetheless, Musharraf remains steadfast in his decision, hoping to leverage his previous experience and commitment to the nation to secure a foothold in the government. In conclusion, Pervez Musharraf's return to Pakistan and his decision to run for office have brought a myriad of reactions, discussions, and concerns to the forefront. While his ambition to \\"save\\" Pakistan serves as a rallying cry for some citizens, many remain skeptical of his intentions, and his potential return to power raises questions about the stability of Pakistan's political landscape and the ongoing struggle between civilian and military establishments. As the situation unfolds, it will be crucial to observe how Musharraf is received by the people, how he faces the legal challenges that await him, and whether he can initiate a new era of stability and progress in Pakistan, despite the looming threats and obstacles before him."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead, it is clear that Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate Quinn's new job. This act implies Skylar's desire to show support and share in the joy of Quinn's accomplishment. Thus, a more valid answer would highlight Skylar's intentions to congratulate and celebrate with Quinn. In order to better understand Skylar's reasoning, let's discuss the possible factors and emotions that could have motivated this decision: 1. Friendship: Skylar and Quinn are likely good friends, and celebrating together is an expression of that bond. It is common for friends to join in each other's happiness and share important milestones in life. 2. Recognition of achievement: Skylar understands that getting a new job is an important step for Quinn, and by organizing a celebration, Skylar is acknowledging and validating the significance of this event in Quinn's life. 3. Emotional support: Celebrating a new job together gives Skylar an opportunity to offer emotional support and encouragement to Quinn. This camaraderie can help ease the transition into a new position and bolster Quinn's confidence. 4. Social bonding: Taking Quinn to a new bar provides an opportunity for both friends to socialize, connect with others, and enjoy a fun, relaxed atmosphere together.

Question: Given the following context:  The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war. In return for information about the layout of the hospital and surrounding area, Paco tells Artiguez to \\"bump into Viñolas\\" for him.  answer the following question:  Who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime?

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? My ihome broke!","output":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"My ihome broke!\\", one should first interpret the context, the user's emotions, tone, and the perspective from which they are sharing this information. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the underlying emotions, opinions, or attitudes within a piece of text, such as a tweet. In this case, there are several factors that can help us clarify the sentiment expressed: 1. Content: The tweet is about the user's iHome, which is an electronic device for playing music and charging smartphones, breaking down. The fact that the device no longer works implies that the user is facing an inconvenience or loss of functionality. 2. Tone: The exclamation mark at the end of the tweet suggests that the user is expressing strong emotions. Although the exclamation mark doesn't specify whether the emotion is positive or negative, considering the broken device, it's safe to assume that it represents a negative feeling, such as frustration or disappointment. 3. Emotion: From the content and tone, we can infer that the user is expressing dissatisfaction, distress, or annoyance because their iHome is broken, affecting their experience with the device and possibly their daily routine. 4. Perspective: The tweet is written in the first person, which means that the person experiencing the sentiment is the one posting the tweet. This personal perspective emphasizes the user's own emotional experience with the broken iHome. Taking all these factors into account, one could describe the sentiment of this tweet as predominantly negative due to the user's frustration, disappointment, or dissatisfaction about their broken iHome device.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options:  *no;  *yes;","output":"The two questions you have asked are not the same. The first question is about becoming rich in India, while the second question is about setting up a new political party in India and becoming Prime Minister. The answer to your initial inquiry is *no*, these questions address different topics.  Now, let's address each question in detail. 1. What is the best way to become rich in India? There is no perfect formula for becoming wealthy, but here are some possible paths to accumulating wealth in India: a. Entrepreneurship: Starting your own business can be a path to wealth if you are able to identify and develop a unique idea. To be successful, you would need to conduct thorough market research, create a solid business plan, and work tirelessly to develop and expand the business. b. Real estate: Many wealthy individuals have built their fortunes through real estate investments, either by purchasing properties in upcoming locations and waiting for their value to increase, or by developing real estate themselves. c. Stock market investments: While investing in the stock market may require capital and involves risks, it is an avenue that has the potential for substantial returns if done wisely. d. Education and expertise: Acquiring an in-demand skill set or becoming an expert in a particular industry can lead to higher-paying job opportunities or enable you to open a successful consultancy firm. e. Passive income: Creating streams of passive income, such as writing a best-selling book, creating an app, or securing royalties from patents, may require initial effort and investment but can lead to long-term wealth accumulation. 2. What is the best way to set up a new political party in India and become PM? Becoming the Prime Minister of India involves setting up a political party and building public support. Here are some steps to consider: a. Familiarize yourself with the existing political landscape and identify the gaps or weaknesses that your new party can address.  b. Develop a clear and coherent party ideology and platform. This should cover a range of social, economic, and political issues, as well as providing concrete solutions to the problems your party aims to address. c. Form a core group of committed individuals who share your vision and are willing to take on various responsibilities within the party organization. d. Register the new political party with the Election Commission of India to obtain official recognition. e. Build a strong party infrastructure that includes a central office, state and district offices, as well as local units. This will enable your party to function efficiently and maintain grassroots connections. f. Develop a sound campaign strategy that focuses on effective communication of your party's message, identifying vote banks, and connecting with the wider public. g. Work to gain support by participating in local and national elections. Winning seats in various levels of government will help solidify your party's presence and establish its credibility. h. As the leader of the political party, you should strive to develop your image as a capable, trustworthy, and far-sighted statesperson. Building credibility and public trust would be essential to your bid for the Prime Minister's position. It is important to note that both becoming wealthy and becoming the Prime Minister of India are ambitious goals that require immense dedication, strategic planning, and hard work to achieve."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A NASA spacecraft lands on an unknown planet and begins to take rock and soil samples. Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien. The two trap him inside a vacuum cleaner, which malfunctions and causes the entire neighborhood to suffer a power surge.

In January 2019, Howard Schultz, who had stepped down as Starbucks CEO in 2017 and left the Starbucks board in June 2018, began publicly discussing a potential independent bid for the U.S. presidency in 2020. Schultz's potential candidacy was met with mixed views from various political analysts and public figures, but his prospective run, particularly as an independent candidate, caught the attention of Michael Bloomberg. Michael Bloomberg, who had been the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, is a billionaire and an influential political figure himself. He had previously weighed multiple times running for president as an independent candidate. During the 2016 presidential election, he had explored a presidential run, but ultimately decided against it amid concerns that a third-party candidate could potentially divide the Democratic vote and put then-Republican candidate Trump in office. In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Bloomberg ultimately decided to run as a Democratic candidate but suspended his campaign after the Super Tuesday primaries in March 2020 and endorsed Joe Biden. When Bloomberg learned about Howard Schultz's potential presidential run as an independent candidate in 2020, he was not pleased, as he was concerned that an independent candidacy could potentially help President Donald Trump get re-elected by splitting the Democratic vote. Despite Schultz positioning himself as a \\"centrist independent candidate\\" and voicing concerns about the polarizing nature of American politics, Bloomberg still saw it as a potential threat to the Democratic Party's chances for success in the election. This prompted Bloomberg to make the blunt remark, asking, \\"Who the f**k is he?\\" in response to Schultz's potential candidacy. Ultimately, Howard Schultz decided to abandon his exploration of a presidential run, citing concerns about increasing polarization and the risk of inadvertently assisting in Trump's re-election as reasons for his decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. What did the author say about the Australian sun? Answer:","output":"The author stated that the Australian sun is severe and causes a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. As a result, the majority of people living in Australia will likely have sun-damaged skin due to the country's sun-drenched climate."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The hypothesis sentence is a statement that speaks of a socially normative behavior. In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively Hypothesis: It is wrong to ignore family. Update: You don't know where they're living or how to contact them. Output:","output":"Part #1: Understand the given hypothesis and its context as a socially normative behavior.

Part #2: Analyze the update and identify if it's providing additional context that supports or undermines the general hypothesis.

Part #3: Output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' to indicate if the update is supporting or undermining the hypothesis.

The rockets that lift the orbiter are of two different types. The three main engines are powered by reacting liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen to generate water. Then there are the two solid rocket boosters, which use a solid fuel mixture that contains mainly ammonium perchlorate and powdered aluminum. The chemical reaction between these substances produces aluminum oxide, water, nitrogen gas, and hydrogen chloride. Although the solid rocket boosters each have a significantly lower mass than the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks, they provide over 80% of the lift needed to put the shuttle into orbit—all because of chemical reactions.

Liberty United, a company that transforms guns and ammunition seized by police into wearable art, is taking on firearms one gun and bullet at a time. The company was co-founded in 2013 by entrepreneur Peter Thum and his wife, “Mad Men” actress Cara Buono. The idea: creating jewelry from weapons that will never fire again. Each piece is printed with the serial number of the firearm from which it was cast. It’s like an upscale, gun-control version of the Livestrong bracelet. The smelted remains of Winchester rifles and Smith and Wessons, formerly used in crimes, find new life as rings, bracelets, earrings, cufflinks and necklaces. Products range from 35 for a brass bullet shell charm to 3,895 for a necklace comprised of gun steel plated in rhodium, rose gold, hematite or 14K, and set with pearls and sapphires. Amy Schumer tweets underwear-less pic for gun violence awareness “I’m wearing my @LibertyUTD spike necklace that’s made from a gun,” tweeted actor Alan Cumming in 2013. “Proceeds help end gun violence.” Wearing a piece of Liberty United bling puts you in the company of celebrities like Cumming, Paul Rudd, Cara Delevingne and Sarah Silverman. But the company also delivers real-world results for residents of bullet-ridden communities where the guns were confiscated. At checkout, customers can choose to direct their donations to one or all of four partner communities: Newburgh or Syracuse, N.Y., Philadelphia, Pa., and Cook County, Illinois. About a quarter of the proceeds from jewelry sales are donated to after-school programs and recreation centers. The money helps provide safe havens to learn and play for about 2,000 children and young adults in at-risk communities. “These kids are really hopeful and excited about life,\\" Thum said. “But when we talk about gun violence, they can all name someone who was killed.” Empire State Building glows orange for gun violence awareness In 2015, Newburgh had the highest violent crime rate of any city in New York state. Philadelphia has suffered nearly 20,000 gun-related crimes since 2014. Lieutenant Thomas Mcartney, the commanding officer of the evidence unit for the Philadelphia Police Department, estimates the police destroy between five and 12,000 weapons a year. Liberty United offers police a way to create value from weapons disposal. “You’re taking a destructive item that has been used in a crime or incident and turning it into something not only beautiful but purposeful,” said Julie Wertheimer, chief of staff for criminal justice in Philadelphia’s Managing Director’s Office. Liberty United recently expanded its program to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, which patrols the gun-plagued streets of South Side Chicago. Gun Violence Awareness draws gun control, anti-violence pleas “In Englewood, the school is locked and has armed guards all day,” Thum said. He added that the funded programs provide students “extended hours of safety when they might otherwise be headed home without supervision.” Thum sold Ethos Water, a socially conscious bottled water company, to Starbucks in 2005 for 8 million. His interest in fighting gun violence arose from subsequent trips to war-torn regions of Southern and Central Africa. Thum created Fonderie 47, a jewelry and watch boutique that works with designers James de Givency, Philip Crangi, Adrian Glessing and David Candaux to create luxury pieces from reclaimed uzis and AK47s. Since that company's launch in 2011, it has helped destroy some 50,000 guns collected through buy-back programs. With his latest initiative, Thum said he wants to encourage Americans to speak against gun violence. “I would suggest they take action in whatever form they can,” he said.","output":"A company called Liberty United, co-founded in 2013 by entrepreneur Peter Thum and his wife, Mad Men actress Cara Buono, is transforming guns and ammunition seized by police into wearable art to combat gun violence.

Title: Schindler's List Movie plot: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all.

Activity: In the first statement, the young boy and girl are \\"sitting, possibly selling,\\" while in the second statement, the kids are explicitly said to be \\"selling.\\" Although kids selling something could mean that they are sitting and doing so, the given information does not provide any solid evidence for this conclusion. 3. Items sold: In the first statement, it is suggested that the young boy and girl are possibly selling \\"fruits and vegetables,\\" while in the second statement, the kids are selling \\"shirts and shoes.\\" There is a clear difference in the products being sold by the subjects in both statements, and no direct link can be drawn between fruits and vegetables and shirts and shoes sales. In conclusion, even though both statements discuss young individuals engaged in selling activities, the subjects, items sold, and context differ significantly. Further information would be needed to establish a connection between the two statements, and therefore, it's not possible to conclude that \\"A young boy and a young girl sitting, possibly selling fruits and vegetables\\" if \\"Kids sell shirts and shoes.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Mojo is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those featuring the X-Men family of characters. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams, Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), as the titular hero's archenemy, and subsequently a villain to the X-Men and their various sub-groups as well. Mojo is one of the \\"Spineless Ones,\\" an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology. Context: At the time she wrote the Longshot miniseries, writer Ann Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. (A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special, was also born of these works.) Artist Art Adams designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening. The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor Malcolm McDowell on Late Night with David Letterman, in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the Ludovico technique scene in A Clockwork Orange had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair.  Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues.  The character subsequently appeared in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). That same year, in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include Marvel Comics Presents #89 (1991), The Uncanny X-Men Annual #15 (1991), Wolverine #52 (March 1992), X-Men #6 (March 1992), Wolverine #53 (April 1992), X-Men #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July-August 1992), The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16 (Annual 1992), Marvel Comics Presents #119 (1993), What If? #59 (March 1994), X-Men Adventures: Season Two #11 (December 1994), Marvel: Portraits of the Universe #1 (March 1995), X-Men: Mutations #1 (1996), Youngblood/X-Force #1 (July 1996), X-Force/Youngblood #1 (August 1996), X-Force #60-61 (November-December 1996), The Adventures of the X-Men #9-10 (1996-January 1997), X-Babies: Murderama #1 (January 1998), X-Force #76 (April 1998), X-Babies Reborn #1 (January 2000), X-Men Unlimited #32 (September 2001), Exiles #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), The Uncanny X-Men #460-461 (August 2005), and Exiles #73-74 (February 2006).  Mojo was featured in an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #8, and in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #7 (2006). Question: -Has a recent comic book of Mojo been published in the last few years? Answer:","output":"There is no specific mention of a recent comic book featuring Mojo published within the last few years. However, comic book characters often reappear in new story arcs or issues. To find the most recent appearance of Mojo, it is recommended to search for Marvel Comics publications or related X-Men comics and verify their release dates."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The fort visible from the Cooper River was notable for battles in what war? Answer:","output":"The fort visible from the Cooper River that is notable for battles is Fort Sumter, and it played a significant role in the American Civil War (1861-1865). Located in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, near the mouth of the Cooper River, Fort Sumter remains a potent symbol of the conflict between the Union and Confederate forces. The construction of Fort Sumter began in 1829 as a part of the Third System of coastal fortifications initiated by the United States government. It was named after General Thomas Sumter, a renowned military leader during the American Revolutionary War. The fort was built using labor from enslaved African Americans, which gives an important historical context to its role in the war. Fort Sumter gained national prominence when it became a focal point of the crisis leading up to the American Civil War. The fort assumed strategic importance for both Union and Confederate forces because of its location in Charleston Harbor. As tensions increased between the Northern and Southern states over issues such as states' rights and slavery, the fate of Fort Sumter became a symbol of the broader political divide in the country. The first battle of the American Civil War took place at Fort Sumter from April 12th to 14th, 1861. The Union garrison stationed at the fort, commanded by Major Robert Anderson, had been cut off from vital supplies and reinforcements. The Confederate forces, under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard, demanded the surrender of the fort. When Anderson refused, the Confederate artillery opened fire, initiating a 34-hour bombardment. Ultimately, the Union forces surrendered, signaling the beginning of the Civil War. Fort Sumter changed hands several times during the war, reflecting the larger struggle between Union and Confederate forces. The fort's strategic importance was clear to both sides as it provided a crucial foothold in the Confederate's stronghold. Throughout the war, numerous attempts were made to reinforce, besiege, and recapture the fort. Its battered walls and ruined masonry bore witness to the devastation wrought by the conflict. In February 1865, Confederate forces abandoned Fort Sumter as General William T. Sherman advanced into South Carolina during his infamous \\"March to the Sea\\". The fort was eventually retaken by Union troops on April 14, 1865, just days before the war's end. Today, Fort Sumter is a national monument maintained by the National Park Service. The fort remains a tangible reminder of the American Civil War and serves as an important historical site for visitors who want to understand the pivotal role it played in the conflict."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: What was the weather like?

The award was designed by Hermann Müller and created in the form of a pendant studded with diamonds. In fact, it was so heavy that a special mount had to be created so that it would stay on the wearer's jacket. An extremely ornate presentation box contained the pendant and a wide red and white sash also complemented the award.  - Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke (more usually just Hansa-Brandenburg) was a German aircraft manufacturing company that operated during World War I. It was created in May 1914 by the purchase of \\"Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke\\" by Camillo Castiglioni, who relocated the factory from Liebau to Brandenburg an der Havel. Brandenburg's chief designer, Ernst Heinkel was retained by the new enterprise. By Autumn 1915, it had become the largest aircraft manufacturer in Germany, with a capital of 1,500,000 Marks, 1,000 employees, and two more factories - one in Rummelsburg, Berlin, and one in Wandsbek, Hamburg.  - Dr. Ernst Heinkel (January 24, 1888  January 30, 1958) was a German aircraft designer, manufacturer, Wehrwirtschaftsführer in the Third Reich, and member of the Nazi party. His company Heinkel Flugzeugwerke produced the Heinkel He 178, the world's first turbojet aircraft and jet plane, and the Heinkel He 176, the first rocket aircraft. He was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1938.  - The Hansa - Brandenburg B.I was an unarmed military trainer and reconnaissance biplane of World War I flown by the Austro - Hungarian Air Service . Early models were known internally to the Hansa - Brandenburg firm as the type D , while later models with a more powerful engine were designated FD . This aircraft was one of the earliest designs of Ernst Heinkel , who was working for Hansa - Brandenburg at the time . It was an entirely conventional two - bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span . The pilot and observer sat in tandem in a long open cockpit . The aircraft was produced under license by Aero both during the war , and afterwards ( when it became known as the Aero Ae 01 ) , and also by Letov , as Š10 . Experience gained with this design would provide Aero with the basis for a number of derivative civil and military designs throughout the 1920s . The design formed the basis for the C.I and C.II armed reconnaissance types .  - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.   - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare.

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Context: Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher, 15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", and \\"In the Still of the Night\\". \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's \\"It's O.K.\\" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled The Beach Boys. The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.  The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, \\"[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep\\", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's \\"Good Vibrations\\".  For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album The Beach Boys Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian later called Love You one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that \\"That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.\\" Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having \\"the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother.\\" Love You peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop.  Referring to \\"naysayers\\" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote, \\"Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" The A.V. Club - considering the album in \\"the same vein\\" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You as: \\"something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson - like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art - one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview.\\"  In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage.  From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \\"rock bands\\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \\"the wrong element\\", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, \\"...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element.\\" Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, \\"They're my friends and I like their music\\". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had \\"shot himself in the foot\\".  The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert.  In 1985, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of \\"California Girls\\". \\"Getcha Back\\", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\" (U.S., No. 57).  In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song \\"Wipe Out\\" and filming a music video. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK.  By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. No. 1 hit single in 22 years with \\"Kokomo\\", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. They released the album Still Cruisin, which went gold in the U.S. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, had no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker Eugene Landy.  A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded 25 million for unpaid royalties. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning 13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.  In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording Howdy From Maui, and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian acted as co-producer. Question: what is the most important fact listed in the article? Answer:","output":"It is difficult to pinpoint a single most important fact in the article as it covers a wide range of significant events related to The Beach Boys' history. However, one could argue that a key milestone for the band was Brian Wilson's return to prominence with the 1976 album '15 Big Ones,' which marked his reemergence as a major creative force within the group. Additionally, the band's continued influence and success through the 1980s, particularly their resurgence with the hit single \\"Kokomo\\" in 1988, demonstrates their enduring impact on the music industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The kingdoms of France and Scotland had traditionally enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship, reflected in a defensive treaty signed between the two kingdoms in 1512. When Henry crossed the English Channel to campaign in France, the King of France activated the treaty, sending arms, money and military advisers to James IV of Scotland to encourage him to fulfil his obligations, in the hope that this would draw English resources away from the invasion of France. James crossed the border with a force of some 35,000 men, including 5,000 French advisers. He was opposed by an English force under the Earl of Surrey. The two sides met on September 9, 1513, near the village of Flodden. The Scottish army was heavily defeated, losing some 9,000 men and many nobles, including King James, the King's illegitimate son, and twelve earls. Answer this question based on the article: How many men did James IV cross the border with who were not French advisers?","output":"James IV of Scotland crossed the border with a force of approximately 35,000 men, which included 5,000 French advisers. To find out how many men were not French advisers, we can subtract the number of French advisers from the total number of men in the army. 35,000 men (total force) - 5,000 (French advisers) = 30,000 men So, James IV crossed the border with 30,000 men who were not French advisers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, what causes weathering? Choices: [-] swea. [-] Winter. [-] wind. [-] rivers. [-] CO 2. [-] sand. [-] peat. [-] ice. Answer:","output":"Weathering is a natural process that breaks down rocks, minerals, and other landforms over time due to various factors. Given the facts that wind causes erosion and water erosion has similar consequences as wind erosion, we can determine that multiple factors cause weathering. Let's analyze the different choices: 1. Wind - Wind is a significant factor. It causes wind erosion, where tiny particles carried by the wind dislodge and wear down rock surfaces over a long period. This factor contributes to weathering. 2. Rivers - Rivers are another contributing factor to weathering. As rivers flow, they cause water erosion, where the movement of water gradually breaks apart the rocks and soil particles. This factor is responsible for forming various landscapes and changing the appearance of rocks over time. 3. CO2 - Carbon dioxide (CO2) can also contribute to weathering, but not by itself. In a chemical process called carbonation, CO2 combines with water to form a weak acid, which then reacts with minerals in rocks, causing them to weather. 4. Sand - Sand can be a factor in abrasion, which is the mechanical scraping of rock surfaces by friction between rocks and moving particles initiated by wind and water erosion processes. It is a subtype of erosion. 5. Ice - Ice, specifically in the process of freeze-thaw weathering, is a significant factor. When water enters the cracks of rocks and then freezes, it expands and puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the rock, causing it to break and weather over time. 6. Peat - Peat doesn't directly contribute to weathering. It is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that takes place under conditions of waterlogging and poor nutrient availability. However, it signifies an environment that may be conducive to other weathering processes. 7. Winter - Winter can be a factor in weathering, particularly when it comes to freeze-thaw cycles. As mentioned in the ice point, the fluctuation in temperature during winter months can lead to the repeated freezing and thawing of water in rock cracks, which can cause the rock to weaken and eventually break apart. 8. Swea - This term is not relevant to the process of weathering. In conclusion, wind, rivers, CO2, sand, ice, and winter are all factors that can contribute to weathering. Each factor can work independently or in combination with others to break down rocks and other materials over time. The process of weathering mainly involves physical (mechanical) factors such as wind and ice and chemical factors such as CO2, resulting in various landscapes and geological features."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi seemed increasingly cornered Sunday as security forces defected to the opposition in a town near the capital and the United Nations Security Council voted for tough restrictions on and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. Former security forces said they had switched sides and joined the opposition in Zawiya, a town about 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital, Tripoli. Some buildings in Zawiya showed signs of damage, including a freshly burned-out police station. CNN's Nic Robertson, on a government-organized trip to Zawiya, saw armed civilians taking defensive positions on rooftops to prepare for a possible effort by Gadhafi loyalists to retake the town. About 2,000 people took part in an anti-government protest there, some standing atop tanks or holding anti-aircraft guns. They said they wanted the government overthrown, calling Gadhafi a \\"bloodsucker.\\" Later in the day, CNN witnessed two smaller pro-government rallies that had apparently been organized by government officials for international journalists to see, Robertson reported. The opposition now controls several Libyan cities after weeks of protests inspired by demonstrations that toppled longtime leaders in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. Gadhafi criticized the U.N. Security Council resolution Sunday, telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members \\"took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad.\\" He added, \\"If the Security Council wants to know about something, they should have sent a fact-finding committee.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo, asset freeze, and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- form \\"one of the speediest international responses to a government targeting its own people.\\" \\"We recognize the killings are ongoing,\\" Clinton told reporters en route to a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Switzerland. \\"We recognize we need to advance the humanitarian, the military, judicial, and even forensic planning already under way.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron and British Foreign Secretary William Hague both called on Gadhafi on Sunday to go. \\"Libya's future has no future with him at the helm,\\" Cameron said. \\"Absolutely none.\\" Britain also announced it was freezing the assets of Gadhafi, five of his children, and those acting on their behalf. Gadhafi's son, Saif, denied the government used force on its own people. In an interview that ran Sunday with Christiane Amanpour for ABC's \\"This Week,\\" he was asked about numerous reports of attacks by government forces on civilians. \\"Show me a single attack,\\" he said. \\"Show me a single bomb. Show me a single casualty. The Libyan air force destroyed just the ammunition sites.\\" The younger Gadhafi -- who is a prominent member of the government -- also played down anti-government protests. Just because \\"10,000 or 5,000 people\\" demonstrate against his father, he said, doesn't mean the entire population is against him. He had harsh words, however, for the Libyan diplomats who have turned their backs on his father, calling them \\"hypocrites.\\" \\"If you are strong, they love you. If not, they say goodbye. That is good. We get rid of them,\\" he told Amanpour. Meanwhile, Gadhafi's nurse went home to Ukraine. Galyna Kolotnytska gained notoriety in November after WikiLeaks released a cable from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli describing Gadhafi's almost obsessive reliance on the woman, described as a \\"voluptuous blonde.\\" Kolotnytska's daughter told CNN on Sunday her mother had returned but was not commenting. Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition as tens of thousands surged towards the country that triggered the series of Arab world revolts. About 100,000 people have fled violence in Libya in the past week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. CNN witnessed the Tunisian army, charities and ordinary Tunisians trying to help Libyans on the border. Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food, water, and even the use of phones. The Tunisian government reported Saturday that 40,000 people had crossed its borders since February 20, while Egypt reported 55,000 had crossed over since February 19, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday. The evacuees include Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans, and many from Asian countries. About 10,000 fled from Libya to Tunisia on Saturday, the Red Crescent said. \\"Very large numbers of people amassed in the no man's land between Libya and Tunisia in extremely cold conditions,\\" Red Crescent spokesman Joe Lowry told CNN on Sunday. \\"People stood in the queue for six hours with no food, water, or access to sanitation.\\" The Red Crescent is affiliated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. At least four people were carried away in stretchers because of crush injuries and several lost consciousness as a result of the chaos. \\"It was very worrying to see women passing their babies in cots over the crowd to keep them from harm,\\" Lowry said. There were also chaotic scenes in Tripoli as people rushed to banks to claim a government handout of 500 dinars (just over 400) per family. There were also long lines in Zawiya. Pharmacies in Tripoli were running out of blood pressure and diabetes medicines, a source in the capital told CNN. Gadhafi has showed no sign of relinquishing power. Sunday, the world waited to see whether the threat of sanctions will have any effect on a country where the death toll from the recent unrest has topped 1,000, according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Saturday night, the United Nations Security Council voted 15-0 on the draft resolution, which also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court. Gadhafi and others could face an investigation for potential war crimes. \\"This resolution will be a signal (to) put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence,\\" said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham, Libyan ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier Saturday, he renounced support for Gadhafi, calling him \\"a leader who loves nobody but himself.\\" Hours before the Security Council's vote Saturday, Libya's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader. Libya's deputy ambassador to the world body, Ibrahim Dabbashi, indicated that he and fellow diplomats support \\"in principle\\" a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil. City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli, according to Amal Bogagies, a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising, and a separate Libyan opposition source. Both are based in Benghazi, the eastern city that is under the control of the opposition. Jalil was in Gadhafi's government until Monday, when he quit to protest the \\"bloody situation\\" and \\"use of excessive force\\" against unarmed protesters, according to Libyan newspaper Quryna. Protests began February 15 in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. At least several other cities are now thought to be under opposition control, according to eyewitnesses.  There have been numerous reports of widespread violence -- some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and security forces loyal to Gadhafi, and some by protesters. While CNN has staff in some cities, the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya. CNN has also compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses. CNN's Ivan Watson, Eve Bower, Ben Wedeman, Salma Abdelaziz, Talia Kayali, Richard Roth, Jack Maddox and Whitney Hurst contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about the struggles in Libya, where the leader Moammar Gadhafi is having problems because many people don't want him to be in charge anymore.

Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from  Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \\"irrefutable evidence\\" that \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \\"three-note motif\\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \\"This Game We Play\\" was submitted to MGM.

(2). window was blocked.","output":"While on the ship, the woman looked out of the porthole instead of the window, because the window was blocked. Often times, when cruise ships embark on long journeys, unexpected situations can arise causing some of the facilities and amenities on board to be temporarily unavailable or obstructed. In this case, the lack of a clear view through the window prompted the woman to make use of the porthole for a glimpse of the breathtaking oceanic scenery. In addition to the stunning views they can offer, portholes serve various purposes on seafaring vessels. They not only allow natural light to stream into cabins, but also provide proper air circulation and help maintain a comfortable cabin temperature for passengers. Functioning as an essential structural and safety feature, portholes on modern vessels are constructed with high-quality materials and come in watertight designs to offer reliability and peace of mind. The woman, intrigued and enthralled by the vastness of the ocean, was able to make the most out of her situation by employing the porthole. As she peered through the small, round opening, she found herself immersing in the beauty and tranquility of the endless horizon. The sparkling surface of the water stretching far and wide appeared to be an ethereal painting, inviting the viewer to get lost in its depth. Gazing at the occasional seabirds gliding effortlessly through the sky, the woman pondered over the majesty of nature and the role human beings play in its protection and conservation. She recalled tales of ancient seafarers and explorers, who once embarked on mighty voyages that expanded global knowledge and human understanding of the world's oceans. Embracing serendipity, she marveled at how the mere obstruction of a window led her to experience a moment of profound reflection and appreciation of the power of nature. Her porthole view presented opportunities to witness the vast palette of colors that painted the sky during sunrise and sunset, further enriching her soul. As dusk approached, the woman would observe the merging of reds, oranges, and purples as day seamlessly turned to night. The twilight transformed the water's surface from a shimmering expanse of light to a deep, dark canvass bearing the reflection of countless stars. When night finally settled, the woman was delighted to discover that the porthole served as her personal telescope to the cosmos. With the window blocked, she found that her eyes became better adjusted to the darkness, enabling her to gaze at the constellations formed by the stars adorning the night sky. This provided her with moments of real connection to the celestial bodies, history, and mythology. Without realizing, the woman's initial disappointment in the obstructed window transformed into gratitude for this compelling alternative. The humble porthole had become her portal to the vastness of the ocean and cosmos, and it awakened her to the interconnectedness of the universe. No longer was the woman focused on the inconvenience caused by the blocked window; instead, she embraced the porthole as a unique opportunity to witness the grandeur of the natural world, and to reflect on her own life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: Money management should be easy, right? You earn money. Then you use it to pay bills and taxes, donate some if you can and save some. I have paid out more than I earned in the past. I have been stingy   occasionally and been sorry later. My biggest regret about money, however, is regarding savings. When I was 30 years old, I started saving money. Finally, I had a well-paid job with a salary that would grow with time and seniority. I purchased   my home and moved in. The next logical step was to save money. So I did. In one year I put away 5,000. My goal was to build another 5,000 and start investing  . I was pleased with my progress. Unfortunately, life stepped in. A family member became disabled and needed financial assistance. I could not seem to control my spending, and my checking account ran dry. My credit card bills rose. I carry no regret to any necessities that I bought for my family. However, as I look back, I realize that I did not research enough about balancing my budget before spending my savings account. I used the money to buy fast food just for convenience. I would go to the store for food when my cupboards were still not empty, because I wanted something special. I bought convenient items to save time, not considering that I was wasting money. I should have given up the name brand paper towels and used more dish rags. My 5,000 was gone quickly. That was just over 10 years ago. If I had kept the savings and restarted my savings after the emergency, I might have doubled that 5,000 by now. When I am a senior, I will still regret that 5,000. My credit card debt will be paid back soon. I will be as wise in my charity donations as possible. But I shall always mourn   my savings account. Question: What lesson can we learn from this text? Yes or no, is the answer \\"We should balance our budget.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"We should balance our budget.\\" The lesson we can learn from this text is the importance of managing our finances effectively by balancing our budget, controlling spending, and making mindful choices in both spending and saving."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the amount of men that represented 30 percent of the village of Little Thetford's population in 1911?, using the article: The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911. Two villagers won Distinguished Conduct Medals. Thirteen villagers—over six percent of the..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, 61 men from the village of Little Thetford were sent to fight in the First World War. This number represented over 30 percent of the village's population in 1911. To calculate the population of Little Thetford in 1911, we can use the given information to create a simple equation. Let P represent the total population of Little Thetford in 1911, then 61 men would equal 30 percent of the population, which can be mathematically represented as: 61 = 0.30 * P To find P (total population), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.30: P = 61 / 0.30 P = 203.33 (approximately) Since the population must be a whole number, we can either round up or down. In this case, rounding up would make more sense because the article states that 61 men represent \\"over\\" 30 percent of the population. Therefore, we can assume the total population of Little Thetford in 1911 was approximately 204. Now, to find the exact number of men representing 30 percent of the population, we can simply multiply 30 percent (0.30) by the total population (204): Number of men = 0.30 * 204 Number of men = 61.2 Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we can assume that the number of men representing 30 percent of the village population in 1911 was approximately 61, which corresponds with the information given in the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage  \\"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.

William was more honest and trustworthy. II. Steven was more honest and trustworthy.","output":"I. William was more honest and trustworthy. The mistake was a simple one, but it had colossal ramifications that neither William nor Steven could have foreseen. William, a tall, lean man in his mid-thirties, had a reputation for his honesty, dedication, and hard work in the company. As a natural leader with a good moral compass, his colleagues and superiors alike admired him. Steven, on the other hand, was viewed with suspicion. His hunger for success constantly made him toe the line, causing those around him to question his moral compass. When the top-secret test results fell into William's hands, he felt an uneasy chill creep down his spine. These test results contained the data needed to evaluate an experimental drug's success - a drug with the potential to save countless lives. The slightest unethical decision could bring the deck of cards crashing down, so it was crucial that only the most honest and trustworthy individuals handle such sensitive information. Finding himself in a moral quandary, William decided to confront Steven. Strolling up to him, the expression etched on William's face spoke of his unease. Suspicion crackled in the air, sending ripples of tension between the two. After an uncomfortable conversation that seemed to stretch into eternity, William reluctantly handed over the results. With these results now firmly in Steven's possession, the room seemed to breathe again. The overbearing hesitation that had clouded William's decision dissipated, leaving an odd sense of resolve between the two men. They now knew that they must work in tandem to ensure the project’s success while navigating the perils of corporate morality. Though the situation was fraught with complexities, William's unwavering foresightedness and Steven's newfound sense of responsibility were beginning to align. They found themselves making genuine progress, driven by a common goal – the greater good of humanity. It appeared as though the ripple effect from this simple mistake would bear a positive impact on the company, the project, and perhaps even themselves. Soon, the experimental drug was on the cusp of approval, sending the medical world into a frenzy of anticipation. William's ethical leanings steered the project with a steady hand, ensuring transparency and clear communication throughout the process. At the same time, Steven's keen eye for opportunity kept the project afloat amid the ever-evolving pharmaceutical landscape. The initial mistake, having the top-secret results end up in the hands of William, would ultimately prove to be a blessing in disguise. The combination of these two very different individuals, bound together by extraordinary circumstances, would ensure that their company played a significant role in changing the course of history. The drug went on to save thousands of lives, and the once-divided pair found common ground in their shared desire to make a difference. Together, William and Steven became the embodiment of progress, bringing hope and healing to countless people. And thus, the story of William and Steven serves as a reminder to us all - sometimes, a simple mistake based on someone's strengths and weaknesses can set the stage for something far greater than we could have ever imagined."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Molitor was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. After graduating from Cretin High School, he was selected in the 28th round of the 1974 free agent draft as a pitcher by the St. Louis Cardinals, but opted instead to attend college at the University of Minnesota. He was a three-year starter for the Golden Gophers, earning All American honors as a shortstop for his sophomore and junior years. Between his junior and senior seasons, Molitor suffered a broken jaw. Molitor began as a shortstop, then moved to second base when Robin Yount returned from a brief injury. He made his MLB debut in 1978, playing in 125 games and hitting .273 with 6 home runs, 45 RBIs and 30 stolen bases. In 1981, he spent time at center field and right field to avoid the injuries associated with infield play. Molitor was moved to third base before the 1982 season. Molitor was part of a young Milwaukee Brewers team that lost the 1982 World Series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals. Molitor batted .355 during the series. In Game 1, he had five hits, a World Series record. During the 1982 season, he hit .302 and led the American League (AL) with 136 runs scored. On May 12, he hit three home runs against the Royals in a 9-7 loss.  Molitor struggled with injuries for much of his early career, being placed on the disabled list six times between 1980 and 1986. In 1984, Molitor struggled with elbow problems, played in only 13 games and ultimately underwent surgery in an attempt to salvage his career. He played in 140 games in 1985, hitting .297 with 10 home runs and 48 RBIs. He followed that with a .281 average, 9 home runs and 55 RBI in 1986. That year he suffered a hamstring injury, returned for a few days, then reinjured it. He played in 105 games that season.  Molitor attracted national media attention in 1987 during his 39-game hitting streak. Near the end of the streak, columnist Mike Downey wrote that \\"the amazing thing about Paul Molitor's recent bat-o-rama is not that he has hit in 33 straight games but that he has played in 33 straight games.\\" The streak ended with Molitor in the on-deck circle when Rick Manning got a game-ending hit to beat the Cleveland Indians on August 26, 1987. Fans booed Manning for driving in the winning run and thus depriving Molitor of one last chance to reach 40 games. The streak stands as the fifth-longest in modern-day baseball history, and remains the longest since Pete Rose's 44-game hit streak in 1978.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did paul join the brewers?","output":"Paul joined the Brewers in 1978."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The pattern will also act as the backing on the bow tie, so use something sturdy that also able to be worn comfortably. Ideal backing includes cardboard from a cereal package, poster board or thin plastic folder covers.","output":"To create the pattern, begin by downloading a mustache silhouette or drawing one freehand that matches your preferred size and style. Next, print or trace the mustache silhouette onto a sheet of paper, ensuring that the dimensions are to scale to fit comfortably around the wearer's neck. Now, create the bow tie pattern by adding an elongated, symmetrical oval-shaped silhouette along the bottom of the mustache where the two ends will connect to form the bow. This shape should be curved upward at its center and taper towards both ends, creating a visual balance between the mustache and bow tie elements. Once you have the entire pattern drawn out, carefully cut around the edges of the mustache and bow tie shape using a pair of sharp scissors. This paper template will serve as your guide for cutting the backing material. Choose your backing - cardboard from a cereal package, poster board, or thin plastic folder covers - and trace the pattern onto it using a pencil or fine tip marker. After tracing, cut out the backing material with precision along the outline. Now that you have your mustache and bow tie backing, gather some fabric material such as cotton, silk, or polyester, depending on the desired durability and formality of the bow tie. Ensure that the fabric is large enough to cover the entire backing piece. Carefully attach the fabric to the backing using non-toxic fabric glue, double-sided tape, or even sewing, keeping in mind that edges must be smooth and even. Gently press the fabric onto the backing, ensuring that there are no wrinkles or bubbles, and allow it to dry or set firmly. While the glue or adhesive dries, cut out a rectangular strip of fabric, approximately two inches wide and long enough to loop around the wearer's neck comfortably, creating the bow tie's neck strap. Attach this strap to the back of the mustache bow tie by gluing or stitching each end on either side of the bowtie's center, ensuring that it does not interfere with the overall appearance of the mustache silhouette. To add a finishing touch to your mustache bow tie, consider attaching a decorative centerpiece to the front, where the bow tie and mustache meet. This could be a small button, fabric rosette, or jewel, depending on your preferred aesthetic and overall style. Attach this embellishment using strong adhesive or thread to ensure it stays in place. Once all components are securely fastened, allow everything to dry and set completely before attempting to wear or adjust the mustache bow tie. And there you have it - your custom-made, creative mustache bow tie is now ready to be worn and enjoyed at various events or gatherings, adding a unique and quirky touch to any outfit!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Risk communication guidelines widely used in public health are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk, which focuses on risk perception at the level of individuals. However, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies are more than public health events and occur in a highly charged political, social and economic environment. This study examines other sociological and cultural approaches from scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas for insights on how to communicate in such environments. It recommends developing supplemental tools for outbreak communication to deal with issues such as questions of blame and fairness in risk distribution and audiences who do not accept biomedical explanations of disease.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sequester: Obama to Return Part of Salary Yesterday I wrote that the lucky ducks in Congress are exempt from the sequester. Head Start programs are cutting back; the White House furloughed 480 people; but Congressional salaries will remain intact, because they’re not appropriated by Congress or included in presidential budgets. Lawmakers could pass a bill cutting their salaries—yes, commenters, I know about the 27th amendment, the cut wouldn’t go into effect until the next session—but they haven’t. Alternatively, individual members of Congress could sign over some portion of their wages to the Treasury. Guess who’s doing just that. President Obama announced today that he would give 5 percent of his salary to the Treasury. The president wants “to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester,” an administration official said. He probably got the idea from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his deputy, Ashton B.

Foil: Foil, especially aluminum foil, can be easily crumpled and then carefully reopened. It is a thin sheet that is very malleable and can be changed from a smooth shape to a compacted one by applying physical force. 2. Hair: Hair can also be physically manipulated to change its shape, such as when you style or curl it. While it is not as easily compacted as foil, it can still be altered from a smooth state to a more compacted one, although the change may not be as significant and is likely temporary. 3. Dirt and Soils: Dirt and soils can be physically compressed and compacted through force, such as when you step on it or press it into a shape. However, the other options (roads, H2O, wood, and oxygen) are less likely to change from smooth to compacted by physical force: - Roads: Roads are generally a hard surface made of materials like asphalt or concrete, and it would be challenging to crumple them physically without significant force or specific equipment. - H2O (water): Water cannot be crumpled because it is a liquid and takes the shape of its container. Compacting it by physical force is not possible as it will simply disperse or flow to another location. - Wood: Wood is a solid, and while its shape can be altered through cutting and carving, it cannot be crumpled easily by applying physical force. - Oxygen: Oxygen is a gas, and it cannot be crumpled or compacted simply by applying physical force.

Q:I read this background article the other day: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  I am facing a new situation today: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, the soil in the grassland of Kenya would be expected to have a thicker A horizon compared to the forested area of Tanzania. The key points mentioned in the article that lead to this conclusion include: 1. Grasslands have deep, fibrous root systems that contribute significant amounts of organic matter to the soil. In contrast, much of the organic matter in forests comes from fallen leaves on the forest floor. 2. Fires are more frequent in grasslands, which destroy aboveground plant materials but stimulate greater contributions from roots. This leads to a higher incorporation of organic matter in the grassland soil. 3. Forest soils have greater acidity, which inhibits the action of soil organisms that would mix surface litter into the mineral soil. This results in a more shallow penetration of organic matter in forest soils. Therefore, given these distinguishing factors between grassland and forest soils, the Kenyan grassland would generally have a thicker A horizon (with a deeper distribution of organic matter), while the Tanzanian forest, with its higher acidity and reliance on leaf litter for organic matter, would typically have a thinner A horizon, storing most organic matter in the O horizon (forest floor) and the thin A horizon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The question asks how fishing would further affect this second effect. Let's consider each factor involved in this situation: 1. Forest fires burn forests. 2. Animals have fewer places to hide. 3. Predators can find prey easier. 4. Birds fly away from the area. 5. Waters warm up, affecting fish. Fishing generally targets aquatic species, so it will have a direct impact on the number of fish (factor 5).

So Mr. Flower did his best to be in or close by his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school day. But it was not always possible to be on watch at those times. Mr. Flowers had tried in many ways to protect his glass, but nothing had been useful. He had been to report to the headmaster, but this bad not done any good. He had tried to drive away the boys when they threw stones. He had even picked up all the stones around his garden, so that the boys would have nothing to throw, but they soon found others. At last Mr. Flowers had a good idea. He put up a large notice. It was made of good, strong wood. It was some meters away from the glass-houses.

All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari. State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question In order to answer this question, I need to identify the common area shared by Salt Creek Falls and Multnomah Falls. These are both waterfalls located in Oregon, USA. Step 2: Research the locations To answer this question accurately, I should research the locations of each waterfall and any areas that may connect them or be somehow related. Salt Creek Falls is located in the Willamette National Forest, near Oakridge, Oregon. Multnomah Falls is located in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, near Bridal Veil, Oregon. Step 3: Identify possible common areas Now that I know the locations of each waterfall, I will look for any areas they may have in common. Since both waterfalls are in Oregon and located within federally managed land (national forest and national scenic area), they have these elements in common. However, these are not specific \\"areas\\" in the geographic sense of the term.

Answer the question...when did the new york giants won the superbowl??","output":"The New York Giants have won the Super Bowl four times in their history. Here's a detailed overview of each victory, highlighting the date, opponent, final score, and MVP of the game: 1. Super Bowl XXI - January 25, 1987: The New York Giants won their first Super Bowl title on January 25, 1987. They played against the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. The Giants emerged victorious with a final score of 39-20. The game's MVP was Phil Simms, the Giants' quarterback, who completed 22 out of 25 passes, resulting in a record-setting 88% completion rate and 268 passing yards. The Giants' defense also proved to be crucial in this win, significantly restricting the Broncos' offensive capabilities. 2. Super Bowl XXV - January 27, 1991: The New York Giants won their second Super Bowl title on January 27, 1991, in a very closely contested match against the Buffalo Bills. The game was played at the Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The Giants won this thrilling encounter with a final score of 20-19. The MVP of the game was Giants' running back, Ottis Anderson, who rushed for 102 yards and scored a touchdown. This game is famously remembered for the dramatic ending when Bills' kicker, Scott Norwood, missed a potentially game-winning field goal in the final seconds, allowing the Giants to walk away with their second Super Bowl title. 3. Super Bowl XLII - February 3, 2008: In one of the biggest upsets in NFL history, the New York Giants secured their third Super Bowl win on February 3, 2008. They played against the heavily favored and previously unbeaten New England Patriots at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Giants won the game with a final score of 17-14. The game's MVP was Giants' quarterback, Eli Manning, who had 255 passing yards and threw two touchdowns, including the iconic game-winning touchdown pass to receiver Plaxico Burress with less than one minute remaining in the game. This win dramatically ended the Patriots' pursuit of a perfect 19-0 season. 4. Super Bowl XLVI - February 5, 2012: The New York Giants won their most recent Super Bowl title on February 5, 2012, in a rematch with the New England Patriots. The game was played at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Giants were victorious once again, with a final score of 21-17. The MVP of the game was, for the second time, quarterback Eli Manning, who threw for 296 yards and completed one touchdown pass. The game saw another thrilling finish, with the Giants' defense stopping the Patriots from scoring in the final drive of the match. These four Super Bowl victories have firmly established the New York Giants as one of the most successful franchises in the NFL's history, and their fans eagerly anticipate their next championship appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Statement 1, the subjects are \\"a guy in a blue vest\\" and \\"a guy in a white shirt.\\" The action is \\"lunging.\\" In Statement 2, the subjects are \\"the guy in blue\\" and \\"the one in white.\\" The action is \\"going after.\\" Step 2: Compare the subjects in both statements. In both statements, there are two subjects: one dressed in blue and the other in white. In Statement 1, the person in blue is wearing a vest, and the person in white is wearing a shirt. In Statement 2, the clothing specifics are not mentioned, but it still refers to a person in blue and one in white.  Step 3: Compare the actions in both statements. In Statement 1, the person in the blue vest is lunging at the person in a white shirt, suggesting an aggressive, physical action. In Statement 2, the person in blue is going after the person in white, which may indicate a pursuit or an attempt to approach the person. Lunging can be considered a form of \\"going after,\\" as it implies the person in blue is trying to reach or catch the person in white. Step 4: Compare the setting in both statements. In Statement 1, the setting is explicitly mentioned as a \\"sporting field.\\" In Statement 2, the setting is not mentioned. However, it does not contradict the information in Statement 1.

Question: What happened one week before Millicent's society dinner? Movie title: Dinner at Eight Movie plot: One week before her next society dinner, Millicent Jordan (Billie Burke) receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe, whom she and her husband Oliver (Lionel Barrymore), a New York shipping magnate, had met in England the previous year, have accepted her invitation. Overjoyed by this social coup, Millicent is oblivious to Oliver's lack of enthusiasm about the dinner and her daughter Paula's (Madge Evans) preoccupation about the impending return of her fiancÃ©, Ernest DeGraff (Phillips Holmes), from Europe. Millicent fusses about finding an \\"extra man\\" for her single female guest, former stage star Carlotta Vance (Marie Dressler), who resides in Europe. Meanwhile, Oliver faces distressing news about his shipping business, which has been struck hard by the Depression. Carlotta, an aging retired actress and former lover of Oliver, visits Oliver at his office and asks him to buy her stock in the company, but he does not have the money. Dan Packard (Wallace Beery), a mining magnate, stops by long enough for Oliver to ask him to buy some company stock. Dan agrees only to consider the proposition, he then brags to his wife Kitty (Jean Harlow) that he will take the shipping business through deceit. Unknown to Dan, Oliver has convinced Millicent to invite the Packards to her dinner with the hopes that it will increase Dan's wish to buy the stock. Dan's young trophy-wife, the ill-mannered but socially ambitious Kitty (Jean Harlow), eagerly has accepted. Although he at first refuses to go, Dan, who believes that he will soon be appointed to a Cabinet post, changes his mind about the dinner when he finds out that the Ferncliffes, the richest couple in England, are also invited. Also unknown to Dan, one of Millicent's other guests, Dr. Wayne Talbot (Edmund Lowe), has been having an affair with Kitty while pretending to be tending to her feigned illnesses.

Summarize: A Tarot reading is a narrative, a story that you tell to the Seeker.  It's an attempt to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances and predict the most likely future. The future you speak of will not be a fixed or definitive outcome; it's important to remember that there are no conclusive endings or absolutes. A \\"spread\\" simply refers to the layout of your cards. A Tarot spread is a configuration or pattern of cards. That pattern provides the framework for a tarot reading.  Further, each position of the tarot cards in a spread has a specific meaning.  Your reading will use the placement or position of the cards within an identified theme. For example, many spreads include positions for the past, present and future. They can also include positions for internal feelings, specific challenges, external factors and so on.  There are hundreds of spreads to try, and more experienced readers can make up their own.  Experiment with different spreads, trying especially to choose ones that encourage your imagination and intuition.  Figuring out what works best for you is important; many readers come to rely on specific spreads that work best for them. A three-card spread is great for divining answers to uncomplicated questions, for refocusing on simplicity an for beginners who have just started reading.  Assign the positions in advance, lay out your spread and use what you've learned about card meanings and combinations to tell a story.  Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand a situation are:  past/present/future, current situation/obstacle/advice, where you stand now/what you aspire to/how to get there and what will help you/what will hinder you/what is your unrealized potential. Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are:  you/the other person/the relationship, opportunities/challenges/outcomes, what brings you together/what pulls you apart/what needs your attention and what you want from the relationship/what you want from the relationship/where the relationship is heading. Some possible positions for a reading designed to understand relationships are:  mind/body/spirit, material state/emotional state/spiritual state, you/your current path/your potential and stop/start/continue.","output":"A Tarot reading is a narrative that aims to highlight past influences, understand present circumstances, and predict a most likely future, without fixed outcomes.

Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to \\"a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848\\"), as follows: We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an Anglican minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities. Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian Arnal: \\"[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing.\\" Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan \\"particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them.\\"Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist Frits Hartvigson that \\"Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse.\\" Stephanie McCallum has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia or obsessive–compulsive disorder.Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to.

It took until the 34th minute before Murphy fired home left-footed from six yards before on-loan Ben Turner quickly doubled City's lead with a header. On-loan Murphy then struck twice more inside three minutes before the break. Bradley Dack pulled one back with a left-foot shot on 63 minutes. But it could not stop Gillingham surrendering their lead to City, who climbed to their highest ranking in the Football League since being relegated to the third tier in 2012. Despite controlling the first half hour, City could have fallen behind when Sky Blues old boy Cody McDonald's header was cleared off the line by Jim O'Brien. Instead, the Sky Blues broke down the other end and Murphy took advantage of a mistake by Adedeji Oshilaja to round goalkeeper Stuart Nelson before finishing. Three minutes later, Murphy won the corner that saw Ryan Kent cross for Turner to power home his 37th minute header, marking his first start since his midweek return to the club on loan from Cardiff City.. O'Brien then played in Murphy to round Nelson again before the young on-loan Norwich striker completed his first career treble when he stroked Chris Stokes' cross into the top corner to complete a personal haul of six goals in three games after last weekend's brace at Colchester. Coventry top scorer Adam Armstrong then hit the post before  Dack fired home his consolation goal for the visitors.

So, what's the best answer to the question?","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"what uses sweat to adjust to hot temperatures?\\" is humans. To provide a detailed explanation, let's break down the hints given: 1. Sweat is used for adjusting to hot temperatures by some animals.        This hint suggests that among the animal kingdom, there are certain species that rely on sweating as a mechanism for heat regulation. Sweating is a physiological process where the body produces a liquid (sweat) that evaporates on the skin's surface, leading to a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to alleviate the impact of high temperatures on the body, preventing overheating and maintaining an optimal internal temperature for various metabolic processes. 2. All humans are animals.    This hint places humans within the category of animals mentioned in the previous hint. It is a reminder of the biological classification of humans and implies that humans might also be among those animals that use sweating for heat regulation. According to these hints, we can infer that the quiz question is asking about an animal species that uses sweating as a mechanism for adapting to hot temperatures. As humans fall under the category of animals, and it is common knowledge that humans use sweating to regulate their body temperature in hot environments, we can confidently deduce that the best answer to the question is \\"humans.\\" It is worth noting that other animals, such as horses and some primates, also utilize the process of sweating to cool their bodies in hot temperatures.

Step 3: Analyze the conclusion - \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything.\\" The phrase \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is an idiomatic expression, made famous by British author, Douglas Adams' book \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" This phrase is used to encompass broad and complex concepts and not meant to be taken literally in most contexts. In this context, the conclusion tries to claim that the story of The Prodigal Son can be generalized to a grand, all-encompassing level about life and existence itself. Step 4: Compare the premise and the conclusion. While the story of The Prodigal Son does provide valuable insights and moral lessons about life, it does not encompass the entirety of life, the universe, and everything. It is a specific story with specific lessons, rather than a universal explanation for all aspects of existence. Conclusion: We cannot conclude that \\"The Prodigal Son is an old story about life, the universe, and everything.\\" The story does have some significant life lessons, but connecting it to the broader phrase of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is an exaggeration and generalization that goes beyond the scope of the story."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His next show,Jamie's School Dinners, is about changing the food that students eat. Oliver saw that some schools in Britain were serving junk food--food that is easy to eat but unhealthy. Although it can be delicious, junk food is not very good for children. It is sometimes bad for their health, because it doesn't give them the energy they need at school. They sometimes can't think well or feel down, and they sometimes put on weight. Some of the junk food that Oliver wants to change is canned spaghetti, chicken nuggets, French fries, soda, and muffins. He encourages schools to serve fresh and health meats, vegetables and fruits. He helps the school cooks to make healthy dinners without junk food. People liked Oliver's idea of bringing quality food to schools. Thousands enjoyed his television show. But Oliver wanted them to do more than just watch. At hisFeed Me Betterwebsites, he collected over 270,000 signatures   from people. Oliver sent these signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \\"shocking\\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \\"performance\\" by the lawyers. \\"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\\" Wu said. \\"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients  to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \\"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\\", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. \\"It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal.

They tend to be drawn to intimacy, so they may dislike a rowdy bar as a date setting. Opt for a smaller, intimate location where it is easy to converse.  For example, book a corner table in a tiny, romantic restaurant. You can also try a first date at a quiet coffee shop. If you go out to a bar, make sure it's quiet. Bars with loud music and huge crowds are unlikely to win a cancer woman's favor. Some think Cancer women love traveling. A good way to plan a date is planning short trips. Take her away for the weekend on occasion to somewhere she has never been before. A Cancer woman will appreciate this gesture.  You do not need to spend a fortune on a trip. A day trip to a nearby city can be a great way to spend a Saturday with a Cancer woman. Remember that Cancer women prefer intimate settings. When planning activities for a day trip, look for locations that are quiet and low-key over loud bars and crowded restaurants. Some think Cancer women prefer it if their partner makes the first move. They are unlikely to initiate physical contact or the first kiss. If a cancer woman seems engaged with you, try brushing her hand, touching her arm, or leaning in for a kiss. If you're planning something like a birthday party for a Cancer woman, smaller is generally better. Cancer women have a few close relationships and prefer to spend time with small groups of people. Gather a Cancer woman's close friends for events rather than inviting, say, everyone from her office or casual acquaintances from school.  You can, for example, have a birthday party for your Cancer woman in your home. Invite a few of her closest friends and plan low-key activities like board games. If you take a Cancer woman out for her birthday, invite only a handful of friends and choose a quiet location. Those who believe in astrology find Cancer women appreciate sincerity in a partner more than their career, material possessions, or education. Romantic gestures should come from a place of sincerity. Rather than trying to impress her with an expensive date night, go for something personal for her. For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met.","output":"Some people think Cancer women like quiet and cozy places more than loud and crowded ones.

Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas.

Movie plot title: Went the Day Well? Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans.

Bismark Mensah, who came to America several months ago, was collecting carts   outside a Walmart in Federal Way. It was a part-time job for him. He earned 9.05 an hour in charge of getting carts out of the parking lot. He was used to finding stuff in carts that customers had somehow forgotten -- keys, credit cards, wallets. And he turned them into a customer service. But a particular item stood out. It was a white envelope with a clear window in the middle, and there was a lot of cash in it, around 20,000. Mensah turned them into customer services. Because of what he did that afternoon, Mensah is now the winner of Walmart's national 2013 \\"Integrity  in Action Award\\". Bismark Mensah says that since the story ran, he has become the model the youth in Ghana (his native country). He is now employed full-time at the Federal Way Walmart, earning 10.95 an hour, up from the 9.05 an hour he earned working part-time. Mensah, 33, no longer collects carts and such. He is in the backroom, dealing with inventory . \\"I want to learn everything about operating a store like Walmart store,\\" he says.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs  Question: \\"What types of cases were prohibited by PL 104-134?\\" Response: \\"Defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

News article: BOSTON (CN) – Showcasing the diversity of Howard Stern’s appeal, a woman suing the IRS says an agent who had been calling into the show inadvertently gave the shock jock and his listeners an earful of their conversation on a private tax matter.      Judith Barrigas of Sandwich, Massachusetts, filed the federal complaint Monday in Boston, nearly two years after her debut on satellite radio left her in a state of humiliation and anxiety.      She says it all started on May 19, 2015, when she called the IRS to discuss a private tax matter. During that 45-minute call with agent Jimmy Forsyth, Barrigas allegedly began receiving numerous text messages from unknown people because her call was being broadcast live on “The Howard Stern Show.”      In addition to her phone number, which Stern fans promptly began dialing up, Barrigas says other personal information she shared during the course of the call included her tax-return and -refund issues, and the details of a repayment plan for certain tax liabilities.      Stern’s program draws approximately 1.2 million listeners to SiriusXM every day.      The shock jock apparently got access to the call because the agent with whom Barrigas was speaking, Jimmy Forsythe, was on hold with Stern when he took the Barrigas call on another line.      “Mr. Stern and The Stern Show joked about the publication and broadcast of Mrs. Barrigas’s tax and personal information and conversation with the IRS’s Agent Forsythe and used the broadcast and the humiliation of Mrs. Barrigas as a source of amusement for their listeners,” the complaint states.      Barrigas says hundreds of thousands of people have heard her call already thanks to Stern, and that she received hundreds of phone calls about it in the days afterward, “leaving Mrs, Barrigas in a frantic, high anxiety state.”      Despite her efforts to close this Pandora’s box, according to the complaint, Stern left the episode up for weeks on his website. By now the call is all over the internet.      Barrigas says the IRS was apparently planning to ignore her complaint altogether until she not reported the incident to the consumer helpline run by local news outlet WCVB-TV.      “Only upon notice from WCVB did the IRS begin an investigation into the matter and place Agent Forsythe on administrative leave,” the complaint states.      Representatives for the IRS and Stern have not returned requests seeking comment.      Barrigas is represented by Sol Cohen of Cohen & Sales in Waltham. She seeks punitive damages, alleging invasion of privacy, emotional distress and other claims.      Like this: Like Loading... ||||| An IRS agent called in to the radio show and was put on hold. Then …      Donald Trump never did sue The New York Times for revealing he took a 916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns. He threatened, but to date, no lawsuit has come. That leaves some unanswered questions about the legality of a media outlet disclosing one's tax information, since there are many statutes that broadly guard the confidentiality of tax returns. Can Howard Stern fill the void?      On Monday, Stern was sued by a woman named Judith Barrigas, whose tax information was disseminated in the oddest way.      According to her complaint filed in Massachusetts federal court, she called the IRS's service center on May 19, 2015, to discuss how the tax agency had applied prior year liabilities to her tax refund. She got connected to Jimmy Forsythe, an IRS agent.      Before the two connected, Forsythe had called in to The Howard Stern Show using another phone line. While on hold, Forsythe took Barrigas' call and proceeded to spend 45 minutes with her discussing her tax case. Apparently, during this conversation, someone at Stern's show heard what was happening and decided to air the discussion live on satellite radio.      \\"While on the phone with Agent Forsythe, Mrs. Barrigas suddenly began to receive a barrage of text messages and phone calls from unknown callers/individuals,\\" states the complaint. \\"The text messages were informing Mrs. Barrigas that her personal information and phone number was being aired live on The Stern Show.\\"      The lawsuit says that the phone call in question can still be accessed on the internet, and after what happened, Forsythe was put on administrative leave. Barrigas claims the \\"outrageous violation\\" of her privacy has resulted in difficulty finding employment, anxiety, loss of sleep and irregular eating patterns.      She is suing the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act and for an unlawful disclosure of her tax return.      But she's also asserting negligence and an invasion of her privacy against Stern and his show.      \\"The defendants breached their duty of reasonable care by broadcasting the private phone conversation between Mrs. Barrigas and the IRS on May 19, 2015, and thereby publicly disseminating private tax return and identity information of Mrs. Barrigas’s to over one million people worldwide,\\" states the lawsuit demanding compensatory and punitive damages.      In Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Supreme Court protected a radio broadcaster who disclosed the contents of an illegally intercepted communication. That case turned on a media outlet's lawful obtainment of tapes and the First Amendment. Here, the IRS agent called in, but arguably there wasn't much that was newsworthy about Barrigas' tax situation. Plus, it all happened live.      Now Stern and the government under Trump are co-defendants in a suit over tax disclosures. THR will provide updates on this case as it develops. In the meantime, here's the full complaint. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A woman is suing radio host Howard Stern and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) after her tax information was broadcast on Stern's show.

Let me provide you with a detailed answer to that question: Certifications can undoubtedly help in career growth for several reasons: 1. Skill Enhancement: Certifications demonstrate that you have acquired specific skills in your field, which can be a deciding factor during hiring or promotion processes. Employers value individuals who pursue continuous learning and professional development. 2. Competitive Edge: A certification can set you apart from your peers in the job market. In a competitive job market, certifications show that you are committed to staying up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in your field. 3. Networking: Pursuing certifications through professional organizations often opens up networking opportunities with fellow professionals. These connections can aid in your career growth as you can learn from the experience and knowledge of others. 4. Increased Earning Potential: Many certifications are linked to higher salary levels as they are considered a mark of your expertise and skills. Employers may be more willing to offer competitive salaries to certified professionals. 5. Employer Recognition: Some organizations actively seek out certified professionals and may even include this requirement in their job descriptions. Holding a certification can help you secure job opportunities with such organizations. 6. Job Security: Certifications can contribute to job security because they show your dedication and motivation to be the best at your job. This dedication can make you an asset to your employer, which in turn, can make them less likely to let you go. 7. Personal Growth: Apart from benefiting your career, certifications can also help you grow personally. Acquiring new skills or expanding your existing skill set may boost your confidence, self-esteem, and sense of achievement. However, it's important to note that simply obtaining a certification does not guarantee career growth. To maximize the potential benefits of a certification, it is crucial to: - Choose the right certification program, one that aligns with your career goals and is recognized in your industry. - Continue learning and staying up-to-date with industry developments even after obtaining your certification. - Effectively market your certification on your resume, LinkedIn profile, and during interviews to showcase the value you bring to prospective employers. In conclusion, certifications can help in career growth as they can provide multiple benefits, such as enhancing your skillset, giving you a competitive edge, and increasing your earning potential. However, one should also remember that career growth does not solely rely on certifications, and factors such as experience, networking, and personal attributes also play crucial roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the days leading up to nursery school, talk to your child about what will happen at school. You can tell your child where they'll be going, what they'll be doing during the day, and what will be expected of them. Try to keep it as light and fun-sounding as possible, but let your child express their fears. Try to answer any questions they have honestly and openly. For example, you could say things like, \\"In a few weeks, you'll be going to nursery school. Nursery school is when you go to a place where there are other kids. You'll get to play and listen to stories. Mommy and Daddy won't be there, but you'll have another adult called a teacher looking after you, like when you go to daycare. Does that sound like fun?\\" If the first time your kid has ever been away from you or other family members is nursery school, it can make the process that much scarier. To help take some of the sting away, practice the separation by asking a friend to babysit for you.  Start with shorter periods away, such as 30 minutes, and work up to longer periods. Tell your child you're going to leave, but that you'll be back soon. When you come back, you're proving to your child that you'll do what you say. If your child doesn't stop crying the whole time you're gone after several sessions, they may not be ready to go to nursery school yet. Most schools have open houses where you and your child can see the school. Seeing the school ahead of time helps you prepare your child for going there. Plus, letting your child see the classroom can get them excited about going to school, as it will probably be bright and colorful with toys and books. Another way to help ease your child into nursery school is to have your child meet the teacher. That way, your child will be able to see how nice the teacher is, and they'll have a friendly, familiar face on the first day of school. While school is in session, trying take your kid by the school so he or she can see the other kids playing. Seeing the fun they're having will help your child be more comfortable with the idea of going to school. Whenever you're talking about school, talk about how fun and exciting it will be. If your child sees you're enthusiastic, they'll be enthusiastic, too. Keep the enthusiasm up even when you're taking your kid to school for the first time. If you're upset and anxious, it will rub off on your child, while if you stay excited, it will likely be easier on them the first time. Another way to encourage enthusiasm is to let your kid pick out school supplies in anticipation of school. Obviously, the school will have some required supplies, but letting your kid pick out their lunchbox, backpack, and even new school clothes can make them more excited. Another way to give your child choices is to let them pick out things for school in the morning. For instance, you can let them choose their outfit, as well as their snack or lunch.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Awnings do require regular cleaning, but mildew demands a different kind of cleaning solution and more elbow grease. Mildew is a type of fungus that’s similar to mold. On an awning, it will likely appear as gray or white spots, and will look like a powder. You can simply use a regular cleaner if your awning doesn’t have mildew. To get the best results from your cleaning efforts, start by hosing down the awing so it’s completely wet. This will make the cleaning solution easier to spread, and the mildew easier to remove. To remove mildew from a canvas awning, you'll need a cleaning solution made with 1 cup (237 ml) bleach, ¼ cup (59 ml) of mild liquid soap, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool water. If you need more cleaning solution, simply double or triple all the quantities.  Mild liquid soaps include laundry soaps that are designed for sensitive skin, babies, or delicate fabrics. Do not use chlorine bleach on canvas, as this can damage the fabric. For colored awnings, use a color safe bleach. It’s also a good idea to test a patch of the cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color fastness. Place some cleaning solution on a small patch of the top side of the awning and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing and checking for discoloration. Dip the clean cloth into the cleaning solution and spread the cleaner all over the awning. Re-dip the cloth as necessary so that cleaning solution reaches every inch of the fabric, otherwise you might miss some of the mildew. Once the entire surface of the awning has been soaked with cleaner, let it sit for about 15 minutes. This will give the cleaner time to soak into the fabric and kill the mildew. When the cleaning solution has had time to soak in, take the soft-bristled brush and scrub the top side of the fabric. Use a vigorous circular motion to generate suds. Go over every inch of the awning to scrub away all the mildew. If the cleaning solution starts to dry anywhere, re-soak the area before you scrub. After scrubbing mildew from the whole awning, rinse it well with clean water from the hose. Continue rinsing until all the soap and dirt have been washed off. You don’t want to leave any bleach residue on the fabric, or it could cause early deterioration. If there's any mildew left on the awning, repeat the soaking and scrubbing steps until it’s gone. Most awnings are designed to dry quickly after the rain, so it won’t take your awning long to air dry. If you cleaned your awning in place, simply let it dry on the frame. If you removed your awning, hang it to dry on a line before reinstalling it. Never dry canvas awnings in a dryer, as they may shrink. When you bought your awning, it would have been treated with a water- and stain-resistant coating to protect it from water and discoloration. But scrubbing it with bleach will have removed this coating, so you'll need to reapply it.  Look for a commercial-grade fabric guard that can be sprayed on. Once the awning is dry, spray the fabric guard onto the top side of the awning. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions. Some awning warranties will be voided if you use silicone sprays, so make sure you check the conditions of your warranty. For smaller awnings that you removed to clean, return the awning to its frame once it’s dry and after the water-resistant treatment has had time to dry.","output":"This article is about how to clean and treat awning fabric to remove mildew and maintain its water-resistance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Having agreed to share the profits from the invention with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell promised to split the U.S. profits generated from the acoustic telegraph with them. To ensure the success of their venture and to secure patent rights, Bell asked his associate George Brown in Ontario to apply for a patent in Britain. Their approach was strategic, as Bell's lawyers were instructed to file a patent application in the United States only after they had received confirmation from Britain. This was because, at the time, Britain would only issue patents for inventions that had not been patented in any other country. By promising to split the U.S. profits with his financiers Hubbard and Sanders, Bell effectively formed a partnership with them in order to carry out the development and eventual commercialization of the acoustic telegraph. This partnership laid the foundation for the eventual success and widespread adoption of the telephone, which stemmed from the same principles as the acoustic telegraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \\"the Kingmaker\\")... contains an answer for the question: What was one of Henry V's victories?, what is it ?

Angela is currently cleaning a car upholstery for Megan, because  Options: + Angela could really use some help.; + Megan could really use some help.;","output":"Megan could really use some help. Megan had been swamped with work lately, and her once lovely car had fallen victim to the chaos of her daily life. With her job becoming increasingly demanding, grabbing a quick snack on the way to and from her responsibilities became the norm. Coffee cups and fast food bags littered the car's floors, and even the once-pristine upholstery was showing its age under layers of dirt, grime, and spills. That's where Angela came in. Angela was Megan's best friend, and she couldn't stand seeing Megan so overwhelmed. One day, as Megan groaned about her car's state and the lack of time she had to clean it, Angela decided to step in. She went out of her way to gather all the necessary cleaning supplies and even bought a brand-new upholstery cleaner, determined to get Megan's car back to its former glory. On a sunny Saturday morning, Angela arrived at Megan's house, upholstery cleaner in hand, ready to tackle the mess. Megan protested, insisting she couldn't let Angela do this all by herself, but Angela simply smiled and assured her it was an act of friendship. They started by removing all the trash from the car, filling several bags with discarded food wrappers, coffee cups, water bottles, and various other items. Once the trash was cleared out, Angela surveyed the remaining work, her expression never faltering. She began by vacuuming up the loose dirt and dust from the car's interior, ensuring every crevice was reached. They then moved on to the upholstery, an area where the layers of grime had thoroughly set in. Angela readied the upholstery cleaner, confident that it would make a difference. They started by applying the cleaning solution, leaving it to set for a few minutes as they worked on stubborn stains, scrubbing and lifting the ground-in dirt. Angela knew a little elbow grease was needed to really get things looking clean. As they scrubbed, the once-bright fabric began to reemerge, revealing patterns and colors long since hidden under the grime. The next step was to use a damp cloth to wipe away the cleaning solution, making sure not to leave behind any soapy residue. As the car's upholstery began to dry, they could truly see the transformation. The vibrant colors had returned, and the once-absent patterns were now clear and crisp. As they looked over their handiwork, Megan couldn't help but get emotional. Tears filled her eyes as she thanked Angela for her incredible kindness. Angela, never one to make a big deal out of acts of generosity, simply wrapped her friend into a hug, insisting that it was nothing compared to the years of support they'd always shared. However, their work wasn't done just yet. To make sure the upholstery truly looked its best, they applied a fabric protectant to guard against future stains and damage. Angela joked that this would be Megan's \\"clean slate,\\" a chance to start fresh and keep her car a clean, welcoming space - a sanctuary from her hectic life outside its doors. As the day came to a close and Megan's car sparkled from the efforts of their labors, they stood back to admire their accomplishments. Angela knew the true thank-you was written all over Megan's face, in the grateful smile that showed just how much the act of cleaning her car together meant. For Angela, it was a labor of love, a chance to share in the struggles of her closest friend and offer a hand when needed the most.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,... Question: Why is there most likely support for Pres. Trump's tariffs? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"There is most likely support for President Trump's tariffs because some Senate Democrats, labor unions, and voters in certain states are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs due to foreign competition. These supporters believe that imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum could help protect domestic industries and jobs by making it more expensive for foreign competitors to sell their products in the U.S. market. This would, in turn, create a more level playing field for American manufacturers and could potentially lead to job growth in the steel and aluminum sectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: + Hard to understand; + very in a hurry; + that she was lazy; The answer is:","output":"After completing her assignment due tomorrow in a hurried manner, Riley is likely to experience a mix of emotions. The initial emotion she will most likely feel is relief, as she submitted her assignment before the deadline and can therefore avoid any potential penalties that might have resulted from missing the due date. However, because she had to rush through her assignment, Riley may also feel stressed and anxious about the quality and accuracy of her work. She may worry that the hurried pace of her efforts compromised her ability to think critically, articulate her ideas, and address all aspects of the assignment. This could potentially lead to her feeling less confident in her submission, as she may be aware that she did not have adequate time to polish and refine it. Furthermore, there's a possibility that Riley could feel a sense of guilt for procrastinating on her assignment. She might wonder if the outcome could have been better had she managed her time more efficiently, rather than waiting until the last minute. Realizing that her lack of proper time management has put her in a precarious situation may cause Riley to feel that she was acting lazy. Ultimately, this may lead to feelings of self-doubt about her work ethic and academic capabilities. In addition to these emotions, it's also possible that Riley could feel a sense of urgency to implement changes or improvements to her time management and study habits. She may recognize that by being more disciplined in her approach to assignments, she can avoid the stress and anxiety of last-minute work and potentially achieve stronger results in the future. In conclusion, Riley's emotions after completing her rushed assignment would likely be multifaceted and complex, with a sense of relief and accomplishment mingling with stress, anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. She might also experience an inner drive to grow and improve her study habits in order to prevent such occurrences from happening again in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are traveling alone, distribute your money through your luggage. Place most of it in your main suitcase or bag. Make a rough estimate of how much money you will spend on the journey, till you reach your destination. Place this money in a different wallet and carry this in your pocket. Spend from this pocket till you get to your destination. If you are travelling with someone, distribute the money among yourselves. Instead of wearing your jewels, you can put your jewels at the bottom of your suitcase or bag. DO NOT carry in your purse, just in case it is stolen; or in case you misplace your purse. In addition, if you are going to be frequently opening your purse for things like tickets and phone numbers, what if you accidently just drop them. Have you ever seen a mini backpack purse? It looks really fashionable and is very smart. Plus, It's really convenient to use. The best thing to do is to hang the mini backpack purse in the front, like a baby carrier. There are two big advantages to do this; one, your hands remain free to carry your luggage and other things; and two, your purse is always monitored, and is just under your nose!

Write a text based on \\"another serb army general wanted for war crimes to surrender to the hague his lawyer says\\" Text:","output":"Title: Serb Army General, Accused of War Crimes, to Surrender to The Hague, According to His Lawyer In a recent development in the ongoing quest for justice in the Balkan region, another former Serb Army General, accused of war crimes, is set to surrender himself to The Hague, as per the statements made by his lawyer. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has long sought the extradition of numerous individuals alleged to have been involved in human rights atrocities, war crimes, and genocide during the brutal conflicts that took place in the 1990s. The Serb Army General, whose name has not been disclosed due to legal matters, has been under indictment for his purported role in orchestrating and perpetrating numerous war crimes - including ethnic cleansing, forced deportations, and mass murders - against the Croat, Bosniak, and Albanian populations. His lawyer has maintained that the General is innocent and that his actions were taken strictly within the scope of his military duties. However, the General has now voluntarily decided to face The Hague tribunal to clear his name and uphold the dignity of the Serb Army. The conflicts in the Balkans, most notably in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo, left a long-lasting impact on the region and the world at large. The international community bore witness to brazen acts of ethnic cleansing, where entire villages and communities were obliterated. The scale of atrocities committed during these conflicts shocked the conscience of the world and left an indelible stain on humanity’s collective memory. It is estimated that over 100,000 people lost their lives during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. The ICTY was established in 1993 by the United Nations in response to these heinous acts to prosecute individuals responsible for war crimes committed during the conflicts in the Balkans. To date, the ICTY has indicted over 161 people, with many prominent political and military figures standing trial for their part in the atrocities, including former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadžić. The ongoing pursuit of justice has not waned, and the stories of the victims continue to drive the necessity for accountability. The surrender of this Serb Army General signifies the commitment of the international community to pursuing justice relentlessly and ensuring that those accused of war crimes face legal consequences. The ICTY and its judicial processes have played a pivotal role in delivering justice to the victims and their families, fostering reconciliation, and setting a precedence for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other similar initiatives worldwide. As the General prepares to surrender to the Tribunal, he and his legal team are expected to mount a vigorous defense. The ICTY will be tasked with the responsibility of diligently examining the evidence, evaluating the testimony of witnesses, and ensuring a fair and impartial trial. While the pursuit of justice is essential, it is equally critical to maintain the principles of due process and the rule of law in order to preserve the credibility of the Tribunal and give a fair chance to the accused to clear their name. This latest development represents not only a positive sign of progress in international justice but also reiterates the unwavering determination of the global community in pursuing accountability for war crimes, no matter how long ago they occurred. The healing process may be long, and the wounds deep, but the pursuit of justice and the staunch refusal to forget the atrocities of the past serve as reminders that the international community will not allow such acts to go unpunished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A simple piece of clothesline hangs between some environmentally friendly Americans and their neighbors. On one side stand those who see clothes dryers   as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: One of the reasons why supporters of clothes dryers are trying to ban clothesline drying is that   _  .

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music.  - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.  - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927  June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961.  - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928  April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971.  - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song.  - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.  - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917  June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.  - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally.  - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the \\"Poet Laureate of Jazz\\", while \\"Time\\" dubbed him the \\"James Joyce of Jive\\". Al Jarreau has called him \\"pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planetmaybe that's ever been\\".  - The Composer of Desafinado , Plays is the debut album by Antônio Carlos Jobim , released in 1963 . The album was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001 .    What is the relationship between 'the composer of desafinado plays' and 'bossa nova'? The answer is:","output":"The relationship between 'the composer of Desafinado Plays' and 'bossa nova' is that Antônio Carlos Jobim, the composer of the album 'Desafinado Plays', was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style. Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music that was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.

This same sort of simple informational advertising is still used.Examples are the roadside signs that tell travelers that they can buy fresh corn just down the road or that there is a restaurant in the next town. The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product.

Please answer the following question: Q: What substances affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts?    Choices:  - H2 blockers  - primeval drugs or drugs  - amphetamines  - psychoactive drugs or drugs  A: Answer:","output":"A: Psychoactive drugs or drugs Psychoactive substances, also known as psychoactive drugs, are compounds that can affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. These substances can alter specific neural processes, brain activities, or brain functions, which in turn impact individuals' mood, consciousness, perception, cognition, and behavior. There are several categories of psychoactive drugs: 1. Stimulants: These drugs, such as amphetamines, cocaine, and caffeine, are known to increase alertness, energy, and attention by acting on the central nervous system (CNS). They work by enhancing the release or blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin, which are associated with elevated mood and increased activity. 2. Depressants: These substances, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates, act on the CNS to slow down brain activity and promote relaxation and sedation. They work by increasing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby resulting in reduced anxiety, drowsiness, and muscle relaxation. 3. Hallucinogens: These drugs, including LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, alter perception, emotions, and thought processes, often by disrupting the release or reuptake of serotonin. They can induce hallucinations, distorted perceptions, and intense emotional reactions. 4. Opioids: Opioid drugs, such as morphine, heroin, and fentanyl, work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, mimicking the effects of endorphins, which are naturally produced pain-relieving substances. Opioids can cause analgesia, euphoria, and sedation but are also associated with a high potential for addiction and overdose. 5. Cannabinoids: These compounds, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) found in cannabis, act on the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. These drugs can cause relaxation, altered perception, and increased appetite but may also impair memory, coordination, and reaction time. In summary, psychoactive drugs are substances that can impact the brain and alter a person's mood, perception, and cognition. Some of these drugs include stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, opioids, and cannabinoids, each having distinct mechanisms of action on the brain's neural processes, thereby influencing how an individual feels, thinks, or acts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do not make decisions out of fear of your boyfriend's reaction. Decide what you need to do for yourself and your own sense of fulfillment.  Reassert your boundaries when necessary. If your boyfriend gives you a hard time about answering a text in front him, say something like, \\"We talked about this. It's important I have my space and you need to respect that.\\" Be ready to walk away from the relationship if things don't change. In cases of emotional abuse especially, it's important to get away from the situation. If you've concluded the relationship is emotionally abusive, end it. It's very important you not subject yourself to more bad treatment, and it's unlikely an abusive partner will ever change. Periods of normal behavior, in which your partner compromises and treats you well, are cyclical. Eventually, the abuse will occur again and periods of normalcy tend to get shorter as time goes by. If you end an obsessive or abusive relationship, it's normal to suffer feelings of low self worth in the aftermath. A good way to counteract such negative thoughts is through seeking out people who value you as a person. Seek the support of friends and family members who care about you and want to see you successful and happy.  Find your most supportive friends. Connect with people who are positive and care about who you are. Have people you can share your passions with. If you're a writer, for example, host a small workshop with your friends where you share one another's work.

Here's a detailed explanation: The scene is a field where people are training in the sport of hurling. Hurling is an outdoor team sport of ancient Gaelic and Irish origin. It involves two teams trying to score points by hitting a small ball called a sliotar with a wooden stick known as a hurley. Given the context, it is only logical to expect players to practice their fundamental skills in the sport. Option a) suggests that the people will engage in an unspecified round of throwing rather than participating in a hurling practice session. The concept of \\"other an throw the balls\\" does not make clear sense. Moreover, it does not accurately represent the sport of hurling. Option c) describes participants taking up archery and throwing it behind other people. This event does not align with the practice of hurling. Archery is a completely different sport that involves shooting arrows with a bow, and it does not correlate with the setup presented in the question. Option d) suggests that people throw strikes while running and throwing the ball. This option, although seemingly related to hurling, is not an accurate representation of the sport. Hurling does not involve throwing strikes per se, and the usage of such a term creates confusion around the practice activity. In contrast, option b) lines up with the scenario provided and describes an activity consistent with hurling practice. Throwing and catching the sliotar (ball) are essential skills for hurling; thus, players would logically throw a ball to other players in the field as part of their training session. This activity would help improve players' accuracy, timing, and coordination, preparing them for actual game situations. In conclusion, given the context of people training in hurling on a field, the most logical next event is option b), where players throw a ball to other players in the field to practice and enhance their fundamental skills in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice?  MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ;","output":"The review seems to lean towards a negative opinion of the movie.  The reviewer begins by comparing \\"hill,\\" presumably the movie's director or a leading figure in the movie, to reputable filmmakers Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich. By implying that Hill isn't quite at the level of these iconic directors, the reviewer subtly undermines his abilities or the movie's worth. While it may not be a direct or harsh criticism, the comparison insinuates that the movie being reviewed isn't as well-crafted as it could be if it was made by Don Siegel or Robert Aldrich. Next, the review mentions there being \\"no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair.\\" Presumably, this phrase is referring to a lack of emotional depth in the film. The use of the term \\"chest hair\\" appears to be a metaphor for machismo or bravado, which may be some of the surface-level qualities found in the movie. By saying that there is nothing beneath the chest hair, the reviewer critiques the movie for not having anything deeper, more profound, or emotionally resonant for the audience. In conclusion, while the review is not explicitly negative, its opinion of the movie can be inferred as negative based on the unfavorable comparison to other directors and the criticism of a lack of emotional depth. The reviewer's phrasing may be indirect, but the overall impression given is that the movie is not as great as it could be, and thus it leans more towards a negative opinion."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However, upon watching the movie, it became evident that the actual experience fell significantly short of my expectations. The story of \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" revolves around the journey of a young and ambitious artist struggling to find fame and acceptance in a ruthless and unforgiving world. On paper, this narrative appears to hold the potential for an emotionally charged and thought-provoking exploration of human desires and the nature of success. Regrettably, the screenplay and direction fail to deliver the meaningfulness and depth that the concept deserves, instead opting for heavy-handed melodrama and clichéd dialogues. In doing so, it reduces the film's potential for thoughtful exploration of the character's psyche and sense of self-worth. The lackluster cast further exacerbates the film's woes. Lamentably, the lead actor's performance is disappointingly one-dimensional, which ultimately fails to inspire any emotional connection with the character. The supporting cast, while competent in their roles, is unable to overcome the film's weak writing and direction. Consequently, the movie's pacing suffers, as it drags out scenes that should feel tense and revelatory. Additionally, the cinematography of \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" is far from inspired. The color palette is drab, and the visual compositions lack artistic flair. Similarly, the score is forgettable at best, barely managing to leave a semblance of a lasting impression. However, it is worth disclosing that \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" does offer fleeting glimpses of promise. At times, the story touches upon pertinent themes, like the costs of ambition and the fleeting nature of achievement. In these moments, the film almost succeeds in resonating emotionally. Sadly, these instances are far and few between and are quickly overshadowed by the many weaknesses that envelop the production. In summary, \\"Disillusioned Dreams\\" is a classic case of a film with captivating potential that fails to deliver due to its numerous setbacks – a weak screenplay, lackluster performances, and unremarkable cinematography. As a movie that many hoped to be an emotional and thought-provoking exploration of ambition, it is a regretful outcome. Ultimately, the film leaves us with a profound sense of disillusionment, albeit not the kind its creators intended."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize the following: Don't house the hedgehog under your stereo player or television. As a prey animal in the wild that depends largely on its sense of hearing, your hedgehog will find too much noise and activity very distressing. Ensure that noise, lighting and activity levels are low in its vicinity and move the cage if the noise levels increase for any reason. Hedgehogs can get used to noise if introduced gradually. Hedgehogs are prone to putting on weight, so exercise is a must for them. This means plenty of toys, along with its hedgehog wheel. Toys should be something they can chew, push, nuzzle and even tip over, as long as they cannot chew pieces off or swallow. Be sure their nails or feet can't get caught in any loose strings or small holes.  Possible toys include: rubber balls, old kids' toys, rubber figures, baby teething rings, empty toilet paper tubes cut in half lengthwise, cat balls or bird toys with bells inside, etc.  Let your hedgehog play in a larger playpen occasionally. You can purchase a large plastic tub or let it explore your bath (without water, of course). Hedgehogs are notoriously good at hiding ailments, so it is extremely necessary to be aware of your hedgehog. Keep track of any changes and call your vet to see if there's something that needs to be checked out.  If your hedgehog doesn't eat for one or two days, something is wrong and it needs veterinary attention. Hedgehogs that go for a few days without food are at risk of developing fatty liver disease, a life-threatening condition.  Watch out for scaly, dry skin around the quills: this could be a sign of mites, which can be debilitating if left unchecked. Wheezing or crackly respiration as well as discharge on the face or wrists are signs of respiratory infection, a common and serious condition in hedgehogs. Soft stools for more than a day, or diarrhea combined with listlessness or lack of appetite can be signs of a parasite infection or other illness. Hibernation, though occurring in the wild, is not safe for hedgehogs living in captivity. As mentioned above, if your hedgie feels cool on the belly, try to warm him by putting him under your shirt next to your skin. If he does not warm within an hour, bring him immediately to the veterinarian's. A hedgehog's familiarity with being held comes with being handled frequently.  Always be confident when handling a hedgehog: they are not as fragile as they seem. The general rule is at least 30 minutes a day of handling.  Approach your hedgie quietly and slowly. Pick it up by lifting it from underneath, then hold it cupped in both hands.  Make time for play. As well as handling your hedgehog, don't be afraid to join in with play. Your hedgehog will accept your involvement in play if you join in regularly. Clean the dishes and water bottle/bowl daily with hot water. Clean the wheel and spot-clean daily, changing bedding weekly or as needed. Some hedgies are cleaner than others, so you may need to bathe it more or less frequently.  Fill a sink with warm (not hot) water to the level of the hog's belly. Water should not get in their ears or nose. Add a mild oatmeal bath (such as Aveeno) or puppy bath to the water, and use a toothbrush to brush out their quills and feet. Rinse with warm water and snuggle in a clean, dry towel until your friend is dry. If she'll tolerate it, use a hair dryer on low - otherwise, stick with the towel. Never put a wet hedgie back in its cage. If they get too long and curl around, they can get ripped off while running on their wheel.  Clip your hog's nails with small manicure scissors, trimming off only the very tips. If bleeding occurs, dab a little cornstarch on the spot with a Q-tip. Don't use commercially available powders, which are apt to sting. Quilling is the hedgehog equivalent of our losing baby teeth or a snake shedding its skin. This begins to happen at six to eight weeks of age and can happen throughout their first year of life as the baby quills make way for adult quills. This is a normal process and not something to worry about unless there are signs of illness or discomfort present, or the quills are failing to grow back. Your hedgehog may be irritable during this process and less amenable to being held; you can try an oatmeal bath to ease their discomfort. It is only a phase.","output":"The text provides comprehensive information about taking care of a hedgehog. It's crucial to provide a calm, quiet environment, arrange for plenty of exercise with the right type of toys, and permit some free roam outside the cage now and then. Hedgehogs can hide illnesses, so vigilance is key. Signs of illness include changes in eating habits, dry or scaly skin, and respiratory issues. They are prone to several health conditions, like fatty liver disease or mite infestations, and need immediate veterinary attention when sick. Regular handling trains them to be comfortable with human contact. Hygiene needs include daily dish cleaning, weekly bedding changes, periodic baths, and nail trimming. Quilling, the process of shedding baby quills for adult ones, can happen during the first year and may cause temporary irritability. A proper caring routine, including play and handling, will make hedgehogs comfortable around their human caretakers. It's important to remember that a hedgehog's natural habitat should be respected by limiting areas with high noise or bright lighting, such as near televisions or stereo players."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: i. You will need to put oil in the bottom of your frying pan and heat it up over medium-low heat until the oil shimmers, too hot and your egg will burn.. ii. You will need to put oil in the bottom of your frying pan and heat it up over medium-high heat until the oil starts slightly smoking..","output":"The goal is to determine the best time to add an egg to the pan for frying. To accomplish this goal, I would recommend going with option i. You will need to put oil in the bottom of your frying pan and heat it up over medium-low heat until the oil shimmers. Here's a detailed explanation: Option i. (The Recommended method) 1. Choose the right pan: To fry an egg properly, use a non-stick or a well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan. The pan should have a flat bottom and low, slightly sloping sides. 2. Add the oil: Pour enough oil or fat (such as butter) to cover the bottom of the pan lightly. You can use vegetable oil, olive oil, or whatever oil you prefer. The oil helps prevent the egg from sticking and ensures even cooking. 3. Heat the oil: Put the pan on the stove and set it to medium-low heat. Wait for the oil to heat up slowly, which may take a few minutes. You want the heat to be just right, as too high heat can cause the egg to crisp up too quickly, while low heat might cause it to stick. 4. Check the oil temperature: When the oil starts to shimmer, it's ready for the egg. You can also check by dipping the tip of a wooden spoon or a chopstick into the oil; if it produces small bubbles around the wood, it's ready. 5. Crack the egg: Crack a fresh egg into a small bowl or ramekin. Removing any particles of shell and ensuring that both the yolk and white are intact. 6. Add the egg to the pan: Gently slide the egg from the bowl into the pan. You will hear a sizzle as the egg hits the pan, and the white will start to cook and turn opaque. 7. Cook the egg: Allow the egg to cook undisturbed for a few minutes until the whites are set and no longer translucent. You can also put a lid on the pan for about 1-2 minutes to help cook the top part of the egg. 8. Optional: If you prefer an over-easy or over-medium egg, gently flip the egg over using a spatula and cook it for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on your desired doneness for the yolk. 9. Remove the egg: Once the egg is cooked to your liking, use a spatula to gently slide under the egg and lift it from the pan, placing it onto a plate. 10. Season and serve: Season the fried egg with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately. Option ii. (Not recommended) Heating oil over medium-high heat until it slightly starts smoking is not advisable for frying eggs. At this temperature, the oil is too hot and would result in uneven cooking, with the edges burning and the egg white becoming tough. Such high heat would also make it challenging to control the cooking process, causing the egg yolk to cook too much or even break while flipping it. In conclusion, adding the egg to the pan when the oil shimmers over medium-low heat (Option i) is a more suitable method for frying eggs. This method provides optimal control over the cooking process, resulting in a perfectly fried egg with a tender white and a runny or slightly set yolk, depending on your preference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - hallway - light switch - candle - lamp - house Answer:","output":"A candle is the most suitable light source that does not require electricity among the given options. A candle is made up of a wick embedded in a wax column. When the wick is lit, the heat from the flame melts a portion of the wax, creating a liquid pool. The liquid wax is drawn up through the wick by capillary action, supplying more fuel to the flame. This process continues until either the wick or the wax is depleted, causing the flame to be extinguished. Candles have been used for centuries as a light source, long before the advent of electric lighting. They were an essential means of illumination in homes, churches, and public buildings. Besides providing light, candles have also been used for religious ceremonies, meditation, and creating a sense of ambiance in various settings. Candles come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and designs, catering to different needs and preferences. They can be made from different types of wax, such as beeswax, paraffin, or soy wax. Some candles have scented oils added to create pleasant fragrances when burned. Compared to the other options provided, a hallway, light switch, lamp, and house, a candle stands out as the only one that does not depend on electricity to provide light. A hallway is merely a space in a building, a light switch is a device used to control electric lights, and a lamp is an electric light fixture designed to provide illumination. A house is a larger structure that might contain various light sources, which usually require electricity. While candles are a reliable light source during power outages or in locations without electricity, they should be used with caution. It is essential to keep them away from flammable materials, place them on stable surfaces to prevent tipping, and not leave them unattended while burning. Moreover, candles can produce a small amount of indoor pollutants, such as soot and certain volatile organic compounds when burned. It is crucial to ensure proper ventilation and avoid extended use to minimize potential health risks. Today, candles coexist with other non-electric light sources, such as oil lamps, solar lamps, and battery-operated lanterns. Each option has its pros and cons, depending on the specific situation and preferences of the user. However, in terms of simplicity, affordability, and historical significance, candles remain an enduring and viable alternative to electric lighting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, what does threatening behavior cause in animals among the following options: - negative  - stress  - dog  - knife  - disease  - Movement  - influenza  - h2o Answer:","output":"Threatening behavior causes stress in animals. The fight-or-flight response is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. This response is triggered by the release of hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, that prepare an animal's body to either confront the potential threat or flee from it. Stress is a natural reaction to various challenging situations encountered by animals during their lives. It is an essential part of an animal's existence, allowing it to respond quickly and appropriately to danger. When an animal experiences a stressful situation, such as a confrontation with a predator or another animal, its body goes through several physiological and behavioral changes designed to maximize the chances of survival. These changes may include increased heart rate, heightened awareness, and a rush of energy, among other things. Experiencing stress in response to threatening behavior helps the animal to make quick decisions and take appropriate actions that could be life-saving. While stress is a normal and necessary part of an animal's life, prolonged or excessive exposure to stress can have negative consequences on an animal's health and well-being. If an animal constantly experiences threatening behavior or other stressors, its body's resources can become depleted, which can lead to a weakened immune system, increased susceptibility to disease, and, in severe cases, death. Therefore, among the options provided, threatening behavior causes stress in animals. This stress triggers the fight-or-flight response, which is an essential part of an animal's reaction to dangerous situations and improves their chances of survival. However, it is important to note that prolonged or excessive exposure to stress can have negative impacts on an animal's health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Question: -  Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals  What might be the last step of the process?

Background: Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 - 14 March 2014), originally known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 years between the 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard left from the early 1980s, and was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party. Benn inherited a peerage on his father's death (as 2nd Viscount Stansgate), which prevented his continuing as an MP. Context: Benn's father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.  In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn automatically became a peer, preventing him from sitting in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.  Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., who were going to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22 pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963. Question: What is peerage?. Whats the answer?","output":"Peerage is like a special club for important people in the United Kingdom. These people are given fancy titles and sometimes become members of a group called the House of Lords, which helps make the country's laws. When someone gets a peerage, it can be passed on to their children when they grow up. Tony Benn got one of these titles from his dad, but he didn't want it because it stopped him from being in another group called the House of Commons, where he liked to work. So, after some time, they changed the rules and let Tony give up his fancy title, and he went back to the House of Commons to continue his work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"Returning to Turkey, the reform process must continue, and the European Union should continue to encourage the process and progress. In more detail, Turkey has been undergoing a transformation for several years, attempting to modernize its political, social, and economic systems in the hope of aligning itself with the standards of the European Union (EU). This process of reform is crucial for Turkey because it aims to address various challenges within the country, including the need for a more robust democracy, improved human rights, and greater economic stability. The European Union, as a key partner and potential future member, has a significant role to play in supporting Turkey's reform process. Firstly, the EU has been providing financial assistance and technical expertise to Turkey, helping the country implement necessary changes in its laws and institutions. This support is essential, as it allows Turkey to meet the stringent criteria set by the EU for accession, which include adopting the acquis communautaire – the body of legislative instruments and frameworks that comprise the EU's legal order. Secondly, the EU has been actively engaging in political dialogue and cooperation with Turkey on a range of issues. This has included discussions about democratization, human rights, the judiciary, and public administration reform. By maintaining open channels of communication and cooperation, the European Union is not only helping Turkey achieve its reform goals but also fostering a sense of trust and a shared vision for the future. Moreover, the EU has been instrumental in promoting regional stability and prosperity in southeastern Europe. Turkey plays a vital role in this effort, given its geostrategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. By continuing to support Turkey's reform process, the European Union indirectly contributes to the stability and well-being of its broader neighborhood, thus serving the EU's strategic interests as well. In conclusion, it is imperative that the European Union continues to actively engage with Turkey and encourage its reform process. This support is in the mutual interest of both parties, with Turkey gaining access to the resources and opportunities offered by the EU, while the European Union benefits from a more stable, prosperous, and democratic partner on its southeastern border. As Turkey continues its ambitious program of transformation, it is essential that the European Union remains steadfast in its support, recognizing the vital role that Turkey's progress plays in promoting peace, stability, and economic development in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The illegal ivory trade has been a major problem in Africa for decades. Poachers  and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. \\"With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,\\" said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. \\"Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues.\\" At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a \\"zero-tolerance attitude\\" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished.

Its capital was the city of Palermo. On August 4, 2015, it was replaced by the Metropolitan City of Palermo.  - Luciano Leggio (6 January 1925  15 November 1993) was an Italian criminal and leading figure of the Sicilian Mafia. He was the head of the Corleonesi, the Mafia faction that originated in the town of Corleone. Some sources incorrectly spell his surname Liggio, a result of a misspelling in court documents in the 1960s.  - The Corleonesi are a faction within the Sicilian Mafia that dominated \\"Cosa Nostra\\" in the 1980s and the 1990s. The informal name \\"Corleonesi\\" was applied by the media and government because its most important leaders came from the town of Corleone, first Luciano Leggio and later Totò Riina, Bernardo Provenzano and Leoluca Bagarella, Riinas brother-in-law.   - Corleone (Sicilian: \\"Cunigghiuni\\" or \\"Curliuni\\") is a small town and \\"comune\\" of approximately 12,000 inhabitants in the Province of Palermo in Sicily, Italy.  - Bernardo Provenzano (31 January 1933  13 July 2016) was a member of the Sicilian Mafia (\\"Cosa Nostra\\") and was suspected of having been the head of the Corleonesi, a Mafia faction that originated in the town of Corleone, and de facto \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses) of the entire Sicilian Mafia until his arrest in 2006.  - Palermo (Sicilian: \\"Palermu\\", , from , \\"Panormos\\", , \\"Balarm\\"; Phoenician: , \\"Ziz\\") is a city of Southern Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Metropolitan City of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.  - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.  - Leoluca Bagarella (born February 3, 1942, Corleone) is an Italian criminal and member of the Sicilian Mafia. He is from the town of Corleone.

When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails  and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting  gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space?

A spectacular celestial event took place on Saturday night, capturing the attention of stargazers, photographers, and casual observers alike. \\"The colors were spectacular,\\" writes a CNN iReporter in Iceland: Iceland was treated to an enchanting show as the night sky was illuminated with vibrant colors, enchanting all those who took a moment to gaze upward. The celestial extravaganza was captured and shared by an excited and star-struck CNN iReporter, who described the incredible sight as \\"spectacular.\\" The Unforgettable Night in the Mainland U.S.: While Iceland might have been in awe of the brilliant colors, on the other side of the world, the United States was experiencing its own unique encounter with the lunar event. The perigee occurred at 11:34 p.m. ET in the mainland, adding a touch of enchantment and wonder to the night's proceedings. A Bigger and Brighter Full Moon: As a result of the perigee, the Earth's satellite delighted sky gazers with its glorious appearance. The full moon appeared about 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual, mesmerizing onlookers. This intensified lunar display occurred due to the moon's proximity to the Earth – just about 221,802 miles away – causing it to appear significantly larger and brighter than a regular full moon. The Significance of the Perigee Moon: A perigee moon, also known as the \\"Supermoon,\\" is a somewhat rare event in celestial terms. The moon's elliptical orbit brings it closer to our planet at certain points in time, allowing us to witness its larger-than-life appearance when it aligns with a full moon phase. While many may regard this event as just a pretty sight, its occurrence reminds us of the intricate workings of our solar system and the endless fascination it holds. Conclusion: The recent perigee moon served as a beautiful reminder of the incredible wonders our natural world has to offer. From the awe-inspiring colors reported by the CNN iReporter in Iceland to the mesmerizing size and brightness experienced in the mainland United States, the night sky was a canvas of cosmic beauty that captivated the attention of countless observers.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cost-of-attendance stipends show which sports colleges want to spend on This story has been revised to reflect the following correction: All Big East schools are offering stipends to men’s and women’s basketball players, but some are offering them to athletes in other sports. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on this point. One of the most significant changes in the history of college sports is quietly taking place this spring, as athletics departments planning budgets contend with new rules that allow schools to pay athletes thousands of dollars in stipends to cover the incidental costs of college. The new “cost-of-attendance” stipends — money for gas, groceries, travel home and other similar expenses incurred by college students — are optional, and based on school financial aid office estimates. They vary widely between schools, but generally fall in the range of 2,000 to 5,000. In and around Washington, how colleges are handling the stipends provides a microcosm of how this change is playing out across Division I, the financially disparate top tier of college athletics that includes wealthy powerhouses such as Texas and smaller institutions such as Howard. Many big schools in the so-called “power five conferences” are giving the extra spending money to all scholarship athletes, while some schools in smaller conferences are providing the stipends only to basketball players, or are declining to offer them altogether. In this region, Virginia and Maryland — both members of financially flush power conferences — are giving stipends to all scholarship athletes. Georgetown, George Washington and George Mason will give the stipends only to men’s and women’s basketball players. And Howard and American, the smallest local schools in Division I, are not adding the stipends for any of their athletes, although American Athletics Director Billy Walker said his school was “exploring our options.” “Everybody is a little apprehensive to see how this will play out,” Walker said. “I’m concerned that it will cost some schools so much to keep up that they have to drop other sports.” That concern was part of the reason this change is happening this year, and not four years ago. In 2011, the NCAA briefly allowed schools to offer these stipends, but more than 100 Division I schools objected, some citing concerns similar to Walker’s, and the rule was overturned. That reversal, in part, motivated leadership of the bigger conferences to push for last year’s change in the NCAA’s structure that, essentially, lets the power five conferences make some of their own rules. One of the first changes instituted was this new stipend. Virginia will give 3,180 to in-state undergraduate scholarship athletes, and between 3,470 and 4,450 for out-of-state students, depending on where they live, according to Jim Daves, assistant athletics director. Maryland financial aid officers have not finalized their estimates yet, said Senior Associate Athletics Director Marcus Wilson, but using last year’s numbers, the school would have awarded stipends ranging from about 3,200 to 3,800. The extra stipends will cost Maryland and Virginia an extra 700,000 to 1 million or so yearly, but neither school’s officials said they expected to have to cut elsewhere to come up with the money. Schools outside the power five conferences, who can’t count on guaranteed millions in football-related television revenue, are approaching the stipends with more trepidation. Athletic directors at George Washington and George Mason said they’d like to give the money to all athletes, but started with just basketball. Both schools are in the Atlantic 10, and said they voted along with their peers earlier this year to mandate schools give stipends to men’s and women’s basketball players. “You’d like to do it across the board, but that’s a whole other conversation,” said Brad Edwards, athletics director at George Mason, where the 28 men’s and women’s basketball scholarship players will each get stipends of about 3,600, adding about 100,000 to the athletic department’s budget. George Washington hasn’t finalized its stipend amount for next year, but Athletics Director Pat Nero thinks it will be about 3,000 per player, costing the school about 80,000 to 85,000. “Men’s and women’s basketball are the sports we emphasize most in our conference. We wanted to make sure we didn’t fall behind,” Nero said. “We just weren’t sure of the landscape nationally. We wanted to make sure this did not become a competitive disadvantage.” In response to questions, Georgetown Athletics Director Lee Reed emailed a written statement explaining the school’s decision to give stipends to just basketball players. Reed declined to disclose exactly how much Georgetown’s stipends will be, but the school’s financial aid office estimates the amount at about 2,600. “As college athletics has gone through this reformation period over the last several years, Georgetown has said all along that we would remain competitive nationally as we have throughout our rich history,” Reed wrote. To critics of amateurism such as economist Andy Schwarz, the ease with which schools added stipends undercuts the argument made by some schools in 2011 that such stipends could lead schools to eliminate unprofitable sports. “The rhetoric that you hear a business say before a fixed price changes is just that: rhetoric. The actions that you’re seeing now are more telling,” said Schwarz, who uses clinical economic terms when discussing college sports that would make some school officials cringe. “This is a great natural experiment. We’re getting to see change in an economic environment and see how firms react,” Schwarz said of the new stipends. “We’re learning a ton about the real preferences of schools with where they decide to put their money.” Will Hobson is a national sports reporter for the Washington Post. He has previously worked for newspapers in Tampa, Clearwater, Daytona Beach, and Panama City, Fla.

A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hit-man's assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.

Based on the given scenario, we are merely informed that a food vendor is standing on the sidewalk next to his food cart and observing a black woman passing by. This does not offer any relevant perspective or insights which could be used to ascertain the motives or the business objectives of the food vendor.  We cannot infer whether the food vendor desires fewer customers or if he wants to lose money from this situation. Normally, vendors would want to attract more customers to increase sales and consequently earn more money. However, without any context hinting towards either the vendor's dissatisfaction with his business, the quality of his products, his preferred customer base, profit and loss situation, or his business specific goals, jumping to the conclusion presented in the hypothesis would be presumptive. To make a fair and rational judgment regarding whether the hypothesis is true or false, we would need additional information involving the food vendor's behaviour, his actions towards his potential customers, comments about his financial standing, pricing policies, or his general attitudes towards the business he is operating.

The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.

In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto.

Here is a goal: To get your cat to stay off of the kitchen counters. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of getting your cat to stay off the kitchen counters, I would suggest the following method: Step 1: Remove temptations and make the counters less appealing Justification: Cats often jump on counters because they smell food or are curious about the items on them. Keeping the counters clean and free of food will make them less tempting and interesting for the cat. Step 2: Provide alternatives Justification: Offering alternative high spots, like a cat tree, will give the cat a more approved place to do their instinctual climbing and exploring. Make sure the alternative area is inviting and comfortable, so the cat would prefer it over the countertops. Step 3: Use deterrents Justification: Applying double-sided sticky tape or aluminum foil on the counter when you're not around can make the surface unappealing for the cat, discouraging them from jumping up. Always make sure to remove the deterrents when you're in the kitchen, to prevent accidents. Step 4: Train and reward positive behavior Justification: Consistently training and rewarding your cat when it stays off the counter will reinforce the desired behavior. Use positive reinforcement methods, such as treats or playtime, to reward your cat for staying off the kitchen counter. Step 5: Discourage counter surfing Justification: If you catch your cat on the counter, gently discourage them by picking them up and placing them in the alternative area you've provided. Be consistent in your response, so the cat learns that being on the counter isn't allowed. By implementing this method, you will address the underlying reasons for the cat's desire to jump on the counters, while also providing alternative spaces for them to explore and discouraging the undesired behavior.

I noticed that there was a lot of chaos when searching for UFO sighting reports, so I hope this site helps. I wanted to support those eyewitnesses who have tried to tell others about what they have seen, yet were laughed at by even closest of friends.                  More and more each day the governments of the world leak bits and pieces of UFO information to the public. They have a trickle down theory in hopes of slowly getting citizens use to the idea that we are not alone in universe and never have been. The truth is being leaked drop by drop until one day we look around and find ourselves neck high in it.

Photos taken April 2 and April 3 by a camera on the Curiosity rover were beamed millions of miles from Mars to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.      According to NASA, a bright spot appears in single images taken by the stereo camera's \\"right eye\\" camera, but the spot doesn't show up in images taken less than a second later by the left-eye camera.      In the two right-eye images, the spot is in different locations of the image frame, and, in both cases, at the ground surface level in front of a crater rim on the horizon, Justin Maki, a NASA imaging scientist said April 8 by email through a spokesman.      \\"One possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun,\\" Maki said in the statement. \\"When these images were taken each day, the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot, west-northwest from the rover, and relatively low in the sky.\\"      Another possibility is that the bright spots are sunlight reaching the camera's image sensor through a vent hole in the camera housing, which has happened before with Curiosity and other Mars rovers, the agency said.      Latest Houston News Video      (Story continues below ...)      \\"We think it's either a vent-hole light or a glinty rock,\\" Maki said in the emailed statement. Another possibility is that it's a cosmic ray striking the camera's detector, he added.      Before NASA offered a suggestion of what might be the source of the bright spots, bloggers and space enthusiasts started chiming in.      RELATED: The biggest hoaxes ever exposed      Scott C.

Waring noted that the light shines upward, as if from the ground, and is very flat across the bottom.      \\"This could indicate there there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do,\\" Waring wrote on his website. \\"This is not a glare from the sun, nor is it an artifact of the photo process.\\"      On Tuesday, Slate.com's Bad Astronomy blog suggested that a UFO conspiracy site might not be the best source of information for exploring serious planetary phenomena. A more serious source of this light, said blogger Phil Plait, is that \\"a subatomic particle smacked into the camera, leaving behind its trail of energy.\\"      HoustonChronicle.com: Vast ocean found on Saturn – could it sustain life?      Earlier this month, NASA announced that on April 2, the Curiosity rover drove the last 98 feet needed to arrive at \\"the Kimberley,\\" a spot where it can study rock clues about ancient environments that might have been favorable for life, according to a news release.      The Kimberley, where four different types of rock intersect, is named for a region of western Australia. The rover's stay there has been planned since early last year, the release said.      \\"This is the spot on the map we've been headed for, on a little rise that gives us a great view for context imaging of the outcrops at the Kimberley,\\" Melissa Rice of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said in the release.      Rice is the scientist in charge of planning several weeks of observations, sample-drilling and on-site laboratory analysis of the area's rocks.      Arrival at this location means Curiosity has driven 3.8 miles since August 2012, when it landed inside Mars' Gale Crater.      HoustonChronicle.com: Space station sidesteps space junk again      The Kimberley investigations are to be the most extensive since Curiosity spent the first half of 2013 in an area called Yellowknife Bay, the release said.      At Yellowknife Bay, the one-ton rover examined the first samples ever drilled from rocks on Mars. These samples showed signs of an ancient lakebed environment that provided the chemical ingredients and energy necessary for life, the release said.      At the Kimberley and, later, at outcrops on the slope of Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater, researchers plan to use Curiosity's science instruments to learn more about habitable past conditions and environmental changes.

A bright speck that appears to flare upward can just be made out, right at the rim of a rise.      A picture taken by the right navcam on the day before shows a similar bright speck, seen from a slightly different perspective. The only problem is that the navigation camera is a stereo system, and the left-hand navcam doesn't show the bright spots on either day.      That suggests that the \\"light\\" might be a bit of lost data that left blank spots only on the right-hand navcam pictures. And it suggests that people are looking at the pictures from Curiosity very, very closely. If there's a message from Mars flashing in any photos, you can bet somebody's going to see it.      We've asked NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to take a look at the pictures, and if we hear anything back, you'll find the update right here. Now, about that deer-cam UFO...      Update for 9 p.m. ET April 7: Doug Ellison, an imaging guru who happens to work at JPL, quickly told me in a Twitter update that the bright spot is due to a \\"cosmic ray hit\\" affecting the rover. (Later: The Surrey Space Center's Chris Bridges agrees.)      Update for 12:50 a.m. ET April 8: Here's a recap of the four pictures we're talking about:      Update for 3 p.m. ET April 8: JPL sent along a couple of potential explanations for the bright spot, and they don't include the cosmic ray scenario. Get the details here. |||||Summary:","output":"Scott Waring is a man who saw some UFOs and decided to create a website to help people share their UFO sightings. Recently, a camera on a rover, which is like a little robot car, on Mars took pictures that seemed to show a bright light coming from the planet's surface. People are wondering if this could be a sign of alien life, or if it might just be a reflection of sunlight or an issue with the camera. Scientists are studying the images to find out more about what this light could be."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Their influence disappeared and they just went to live in the city. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?  -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no.","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that \\"their influence waned, and they began to be absorbed into the general population,\\" which suggests that their power and impact diminished over time and they gradually became part of the larger, non-specific population group. This situation occurs when a previously prominent or influential group loses its distinctive identity, relevance, or authority, and its members assimilate into the broader society. This process can happen for various reasons, such as socio-political changes, cultural shifts, or technological advancements, among others. The hypothesis states that \\"their influence disappeared, and they just went to live in the city.\\" This statement presents a more concise and specific version of the premise, highlighting key aspects such as the complete disappearance of their influence and their eventual relocation to an urban setting. Given that both statements reference the decline of a group's influence and its subsequent integration into the larger population, it is clear that the premise entails the hypothesis. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis simplifies the premise by stating that their influence \\"disappeared\\" instead of \\"waned.\\" In the premise, it could imply a gradual decrease, while the hypothesis implies a more sudden or complete absence of influence. Furthermore, the hypothesis specifically mentions their relocation to \\"the city,\\" whereas the premise talks about being absorbed into the \\"general population\\" without specifying a location. Despite these differences in wording, the overall message aligns, stating that the group's influence diminished, and they integrated into the broader community. As a result, one can reasonably conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He bought a Tiger Moth in 1992 and realised he had flown it 10 times before. The airport access road in his hometown is being renamed after him. Article:","output":"Title: The Inspiring Life and Legacy of Great Grandfather Gordon Jones: A Tale of Bravery, Aviation, and A Tiger Moth A heartwarming story filled with the excitement of adventure, authentic camaraderie, and the rediscovery of an old friend has emerged from the life of great-grandfather Gordon Jones. Having flown with the Canadian Air Force as far back as 1941, Jones later purchased a Tiger Moth aircraft in 1992, leading to the delightful realization that he had flown the very same plane 10 times before. Fast forward to today, and the airport access road in his hometown is being renamed in his honor, a fitting tribute to a man who has spent a lifetime soaring above the skies. Gordon Jones' love affair with aviation began as a young man when he first took to the skies with the Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. It was 1941, and the world was in turmoil. Thousands of brave young men and women took risks for their countries, and Jones was no exception. As part of the Air Force, he displayed dedication, skill, and passion for his craft, quickly distinguishing himself among his peers. After serving his country valiantly, Jones returned home with a lasting affection for the sense of freedom and exhilaration that came with soaring through the clouds. However, he could never have anticipated the extraordinary turn of events that awaited him over four decades later. In 1992, the retired airman made a fascinating discovery; he purchased a Tiger Moth aircraft and, on closely examining its logbook, realized with astonishment that he had flown the very same plane a decade before. This chance reunion between a man and his aircraft reaffirmed Jones' passions for aviation and brought back a flood of memories from his time in service. The Tiger Moth itself is a legendary aircraft with a storied history. Highly versatile, agile and easy to handle, the aircraft have been widely used in military and civilian training as well as for sport and leisure. The rediscovery of this historic aircraft further solidified the connection between Jones and the extraordinary aircraft. Jones' dedication to aviation and his community continued long after his years of service. His influence has been felt greatly within his hometown, and the decision to rename the airport access road after him came as a fitting tribute to his lifelong endeavors. The renaming ceremony will not only immortalize his contributions to the aviation world but also highlight the profound impact he has had on those who shared his passion for flying. Inspirational figures like great-grandfather Gordon Jones are rare gems who remind us of the importance of pursuing one's passions and leaving a legacy for future generations. Few people can claim a connection with aviation as deep and meaningful as Jones', and his remarkable story serves as an embodiment of dedication and the timelessness of pursuing one's dreams. From flying with the Canadian Air Force during the Second World War to the serendipitous encounter with his beloved Tiger Moth, Gordon Jones' life has been a testament to the power of determination, commitment, and love for one's craft. His radiant spirit of adventure and thirst for freedom will continue to inspire and guide countless aviation enthusiasts, as well as serve as a poignant reminder that some bonds transcend time and circumstance. As the newly renamed airport access road beckons travelers and aviation enthusiasts alike, future generations will remember the inspiring tale of a brave airman and his love for the open skies. Great-grandfather Gordon Jones' legacy will soar for years to come, encapsulating the spirit of adventure, determination, and the joy of following one's dreams, no matter where they may lead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes The prompt describes an older man with a long white beard, glasses and a black fedora who is sitting in front of a white door. Adjacent to him is a portrait painting depicting him smoking. The description provides specific details about the man's appearance, including his experience of age indicated by the white beard, the glasses he wears and the black fedora on his head. The complexity of this visual image is deepened by the introduction of a portrait painting that features this man engaged in the act of smoking. This introduces a second, artistic depiction of the same man, creating a sort of parallel or mirror image to the real person. This second depiction not only confirms his identity but also presents a different aspect of him - as a smoker. The essence of the description is a man placed next to a representation of himself, in this case, in the form of a painted portrait. Therefore, it indeed means that \\"a person is next to his own portrait\\". The person (an older man with the details specified) and his portrait (a painting depiction of him smoking) are located next to each other, establishing a scene where the man exists alongside a piece of art that is a representation of himself.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What was the last name of the person who was bitten by a monkey?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","output":"Ensign Seymour. According to the given context, a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey which led to the decision to close down the Menagerie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No Hypothesis: turkey is an invader on this island","output":"Based on the information presented in the paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is true in the context that Turkey has played a significant role in the division of Cyprus, leading to the creation of the Turkish-Cypriot northern one-third of the island.  First, it is essential to understand the historical context surrounding the situation. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus in reaction to a coup d'etat orchestrated by the military regime in Greece, which sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. The invasion resulted in the division of the island. Up until today, a buffer zone known as the \\"Green Line\\" separates the two parts of Cyprus - the government-controlled southern region represents the Republic of Cyprus, while the northern region is predominantly Turkish-Cypriots, with the so-called \\"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\\" (TRNC). It is important to note that only Turkey officially recognizes TRNC, while the international community considers it to be occupied territory. Therefore, considering that Turkey's military intervention in 1974 caused the separation and division of the island, and Turkish troops remain in the northern part of Cyprus, the hypothesis \\"Turkey is an invader on this island\\" holds true. The Turkish occupation has had lasting impacts on the island and its population, contributing to the unresolved political status of the region. Numerous attempts to find a resolution have been made, including negotiations of reunification under a federal framework. However, agreements have yet to be reached, and the island remains divided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Qualified Person Responsible for Pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, is an individual named by a pharmaceutical company as the main person responsible for ensuring that the company (the product's Marketing Authorisation Holder or MAH) meets its legal obligations for the monitoring of the safety of a medicinal product on the market. Can we draw the following conclusion? The QPPV ensures a company is safe. Options are: - Yes - It's impossible to say - No","output":"The statement \\"The QPPV ensures a company is safe\\" is not entirely accurate, as it simplifies the role and responsibilities of a QPPV. It would be more appropriate to say that a QPPV is responsible for ensuring that a company meets its legal obligations in monitoring and maintaining the safety of the medicinal products it markets. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of this role, it's essential to delve into the responsibilities, the scope, and the importance of a QPPV in the pharmaceutical industry. The primary responsibility of a QPPV is to oversee the pharmacovigilance system of a pharmaceutical company, which in turn is dedicated to monitoring, evaluating, and minimizing risks associated with medicinal products. One of the key objectives of pharmacovigilance is to ensure that the benefits of the products outweigh the risks. The QPPV plays a vital part in the establishment and maintenance of this system by implementing procedures, training, and quality control measures. In addition to these responsibilities, a QPPV is also accountable for the following: 1. Overseeing expedited reporting, periodic safety updates, risk management plans, and signal detection activities for the company's products, ensuring that these meet regulatory requirements. 2. Ensuring that the company has in place a well-organized and effective pharmacovigilance system, with robust procedures and systems to collect, manage, and analyze safety information. 3. Managing the review and evaluation of safety data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and other sources to assess potential safety signals and identify any need for further evaluation or action. 4. Collaborating with various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals, and patients, to facilitate continuous and transparent communication on safety-related matters. 5. Keeping the company and relevant parties informed of changes in regulatory requirements, industry standards, and best practices in pharmacovigilance. While the QPPV is responsible for ensuring the safe use of medicinal products, they cannot guarantee the overall safety of the entire company, as their responsibility is specifically geared towards pharmacovigilance. A pharmaceutical company's overall safety involves various other aspects, such as manufacturing practices, employee safety, environmental considerations, and more. Based on this understanding, from the options provided, the most accurate choice would be \\"No,\\" as the statement simplifies the QPPV's role and does not accurately capture the responsibilities of a QPPV within a pharmaceutical company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"The claim that publicly funded universities should be open with their materials is rooted in a few core principles: transparency, accessibility, and the efficient use of public resources. As a major component of public investment in higher education, these institutions must ensure that they bring value to society and give citizens an opportunity to access knowledge, participate in research, and develop skills. Here is some evidence to support the claim: 1. Public accountability: Universities that receive public funding have a responsibility to the taxpayers who support them. They must provide transparent information on how their resources are being used and the outcomes being achieved. By making educational materials openly available, universities can demonstrate their commitment to accountability and ensure the efficient use of public funds. For example, a study from the Center for American Progress found that transparency in higher education could drive improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability for colleges and universities (Hess, 2009). 2. Equity and Access: Publicly funded institutions have a responsibility to make education accessible to all members of society. Many students who depend on financial aid or loans face significant barriers in affording textbooks and other learning materials. By making their educational content open, universities can help break down these barriers and promote greater access to higher education across diverse socio-economic groups. A report from the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) found that open educational resources (OER) could lead to cost savings for students and facilitate more equitable access to learning materials (Perry, 2021). 3. Collaboration and innovation: Open educational resources enable faculty to collaborate on teaching materials, creating a shared pool of expertise that can improve the quality of instruction and enhance research. Open access policies also facilitate the flow of knowledge, allowing researchers and other professionals to build upon previous findings and develop new ideas. A study published in Science found that open access research articles were more frequently cited and shared than those behind paywalls, suggesting a positive correlation between openness and scientific impact (Piwowar et al., 2018). 4. Economic benefits: Various studies have shown that free access to scientific and academic resources can generate economic benefits by promoting innovation and fostering economic growth. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, an investment in knowledge infrastructure, such as open-access scientific journals, can contribute significantly to economic growth and social welfare (WIPO, 2021). Additionally, a study from the Copenhagen Business School estimated that an open-science policy in the European Union could generate a return on investment between 1.3 - 2.0 times the initial costs in the long term (Munuera et al., 2018). 5. Global outreach: By promoting openness in their materials, publicly funded universities contribute to the global pursuit of knowledge. They create opportunities for students and researchers in low and middle-income countries to access high-quality learning resources and engage with cutting-edge research. A study conducted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) found that open educational resources can promote greater equity since they provide free access to educational materials in various languages, tailored to various learning needs (Cobo et al., 2017). In conclusion, there is substantial evidence supporting the claim that publicly funded universities should be open with their materials. By sharing educational content and research findings freely, public universities can enhance accountability, promote equity, facilitate innovation, generate economic benefits, and contribute to the global sharing of knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"The crew module is nestled between which two systems or modules?\\" is \\"The launch abort system and the service module\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"The crew module is nestled between which two systems or modules?\\" is \\"The launch abort system and the service module.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sadly it's becoming a regular occurrence for crews to be assaulted. My last time was a few days ago and the worst thing about it was watching my crew mate and several police officers curl up laughing. I'll set the scene. Imagine. If you will. A large rather expensive hotel. Then add to that image a rather drunk and buxom young lady who is lying on the floor in a drunken slumber after taking off a lot of her clothes. She was just in her underwear. We were called to look after her. On our arrival she was absolutely fine. Stood up, walked to the stretcher and lay down. Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts. Try as I might to give her a little bit of dignity she wasn't interested so we just made sure no one could see inside the ambulance. After a few minutes she calmed down so I put the blanket over her. Something I do for almost every patient. Without warning THWACK. she hit my in the face with her boob. Then. As I reeled from this waiting for my brain to catch up and make sense of everything, THWACK she did it again. Right round the face with a large breast!!

What is biological evolution by natural selection? What are some examples? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choices: (I) no. (II) yes.","output":"The theory of evolution by natural selection, also known as biological evolution by natural selection, is a scientific concept developed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. The two questions you asked have the same meaning, so the answer is (II) yes. To answer the question about the theory and provide some examples, let me break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understanding the theory Evolution by natural selection is a process that explains how species change over time through gradual genetic changes. It suggests that those individuals with traits best suited to their environment have a higher chance of surviving, reproducing, and passing on those favorable traits to their offspring. Step 2: Key principles of natural selection There are four main principles of natural selection: 1. Variation: Individuals within a population exhibit variations in their traits, such as size, color, shape, or behavior. 2. Inheritance: Some of these variations are inheritable, meaning they can be passed down from parent to offspring through genes. 3. Overproduction: Most species tend to produce more offspring than can survive, leading to competition for limited resources. 4. Differential survival and reproduction: Individuals with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to their offspring. Step 3: Providing examples Here are some examples of evolution by natural selection: 1. Peppered moths: Before the industrial revolution in England, the majority of peppered moths were light-colored, which allowed them to camouflage against lichen-covered trees. With the rise of pollution, the tree bark became darker, making the dark-colored moths better camouflaged and more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the dark-colored moths became more prevalent. 2. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria: When a bacterial population is exposed to antibiotics, the bacteria with genetic traits that make them resistant to the antibiotic are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass their resistance genes on to their offspring. Over time, this leads to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 3. Darwin's finches: On the Galápagos Islands, Darwin observed various species of finches, each with a differently shaped beak adapted to their specific food source. Finches with beaks better suited to their food source were more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous beak traits to their offspring. In conclusion, the theory of evolution by natural selection is a fundamental concept in biology that describes how species change and adapt over time due to environmental pressures and the inheritance of favorable traits."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter? , can you please find it?   Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US. A:","output":"The last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter is Wood.

She told no secrets; but a hint was sufficient; for Mrs Amy guarded her daughter as a pearl of great price, and at once devised a very simple means of escape from danger. Mr Laurie was going to Washington on Dan's behalf, and was delighted to take his family with him when the idea was carelessly suggested. So the conspiracy succeeded finely; and Mrs Jo went home, feeling more like a traitor than ever. She expected an explosion; but Dan took the news so quietly, it was plain that he cherished no hope; and Mrs Amy was sure her romantic sister had been mistaken. If she had seen Dan's face when Bess went to say good-bye, her maternal eye would have discovered far more than the unconscious girl did. Mrs Jo trembled lest he should betray himself; but he had learned self-control in a stern school, and would have got through the hard moment bravely, only, when he took both hands, saying heartily:  'Good-bye, Princess. If we don't meet again, remember your old friend Dan sometimes,' she, touched by his late danger and the wistful look he wore, answered with unusual warmth: 'How can I help it, when you make us all so proud of you?

A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well. Moved by her personal story and her beautiful singing voice, Tom is soon smitten with the young woman.

This feature makes it distinct from the other two common temperature scales, Celsius and Fahrenheit, which use arbitrary reference points taken from the freezing and boiling points of water, making them relative temperature scales. In the Kelvin scale, one unit of measure, or one kelvin, is equivalent to the same incremental change as one degree Celsius (1 K = 1 °C). However, the Kelvin scale sets its zero point at absolute zero, which is -273.15 degrees Celsius (-459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, one must simply add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature, so that: Temperature in kelvin (K) = Temperature in Celsius (°C) + 273.15 The Kelvin scale is widely used in scientific research and engineering areas, such as the study of thermodynamics, cryogenics, material science, and astronomy. The use of the Kelvin scale facilitates temperature calculations, promotes greater measurement consistency, and enables comparisons across various scientific fields and international borders. Furthermore, the Kelvin scale's foundation on absolute zero is essential for accurately describing the properties of materials subjected to extremely low temperatures. In summary, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin, symbolized by 'K.' This absolute temperature scale is an essential concept in a wide range of scientific disciplines and provides a useful, consistent method for quantifying and comparing temperature changes within different contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket.

The cute creature has been wrongly identified for 100 years, despite having been spotted in the wild, tucked into museum collections and even exhibited in zoos. But now scientists at the Smithsonian Institute have confirmed the loveable carnivorous mammal is a new species and have said it is 'an incredibly rare discovery in the 21st Century'. Eventually, the team discovered olinguitos living in an","output":"area called the Tandayapa Valley, situated within the Andean cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. This hidden habitat provided the perfect conditions for the elusive animal, offering dense vegetation, a variety of food sources, and limited human interference. The olinguito primarily feeds on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, which are abundant in the cloud forests. To identify the olinguito as a distinct species, researchers collected over 1,000 samples of DNA, photographs, and anatomical measurements, and compared them with other specimens housed in museums and zoos worldwide. This extensive analysis allowed the scientists to differentiate the olinguito from its close relative, the olingo, and conclusively confirm its status as a separate species. The discovery of the olinguito is significant not just because it represents a new species, but also because it highlights the importance of preserving the world's rapidly shrinking habitats and ecosystems. As the first new carnivore to be discovered in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years, the olinguito serves as a reminder that there are still countless species waiting to be discovered, but only if these fragile habitats continue to be protected and studied by conservationists and researchers. This unprecedented finding underscores the need for ongoing exploration and investment in scientific research to better understand our planet's diverse and unique wildlife, which could help towards preserving these precious ecosystems and ensuring the survival of species like the olinguito."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What percent of bannermen did the Han represent? Is \\"So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, it appears that the statement provided is accurate. The Han bannermen indeed constituted a significant portion of the bannermen during the Qing Dynasty in China. However, before delving into the percentages, let's briefly discuss the background of bannermen and the ethnic groups involved during the Qing era. The Eight Banners system was a critical military and administrative organization devised by the Manchus, who established the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The three principal ethnic groups in the Eight Banners were Manchus, Han, and Mongols, and they were categorized into separate banners. When the Qing Dynasty took control of China in 1644, they faced resistance from the remnants of the Ming Dynasty and other opposition forces. To consolidate their rule, the Qing rulers not only sought the loyalty of the Han Chinese, who were the majority population, but they also actively incorporated Han people into their military and administration by enlisting them as Han bannermen. As stated in the quote, \\"So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest.\\" This data indicates that by 1648, the Han bannermen indeed represented a significant majority, at 75% of the total bannermen population. Meanwhile, the original ruling ethnic group, the Manchus, constituted only 16%, and Mongol bannermen made up the remaining percentage. It's essential to note that this percentage might have varied over time, but the statement provided reflects the situation in 1648 specifically. The overwhelming presence of Han bannermen showcases the recruitment strategy of the Qing rulers to maintain control in a predominantly Han-populated China, by enlisting them into their military and administration systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: south african football coach missing top players Text:","output":"Title: South African Football Coach Struggles with Absence of Top Players In recent news, the South African football team has been facing significant challenges as their coach grapples with the absence of some of his top players. The national team, affectionately known as Bafana Bafana, has been put through an unavoidable hardship as the coach looks to form a winning team without his star players. The missing players' absence has left a gaping hole in the team, which the coaching staff is struggling to address. Several factors have contributed to this tricky situation. Firstly, some of the most talented players are out of the country, plying their trade for various clubs across Europe. This has widened the gap between local and international-based players, forcing the coach to dig deep into the talent pool to find suitable replacements. Injuries have also played their part in exacerbating the situation. Key players who have previously contributed to the team's success have fallen ill or sustained injuries, leading to their unfortunate withdrawal from the squad. This has left the coach with a daunting task of not only finding replacements but also nurturing their skills to match those of the first-team regulars. Moreover, scheduling conflicts have caused some players to be unavailable for national team duties. Domestic leagues and club commitments can, at times, interfere with a player's ability to participate in international matches. This conflict of interests leads to a difficult decision for players – choosing between their clubs and the national team. In some cases, club managers may be unwilling to let their players travel for international games due to the risk of injuries or fatigue. As the South African football coach faces this predicament, he has no choice but to adapt his tactics and work with the available talent. This calls for a significant shift in the team's playing strategy and formation. The coach needs to carefully assess the strengths and weaknesses of the remaining players and make the necessary adjustments in order to maximize their potential on the field. One possible solution may come in the form of youth development. The South African football system has been praised for its impressive youth development infrastructure. The coach could look to the younger generation of players to build a new, dynamic team that will eventually replace the current missing stars. This would require patience and careful nurturing of local talent, as well as investing in scouting to find potential future stars. Additionally, the coach must foster a strong sense of camaraderie and unity within the team to help compensate for the loss of its top players. Instilling a strong work ethic and commitment within the remaining players can help create a unified force on the pitch. This can be achieved by encouraging collaboration, trust, and open communication among the team members. In conclusion, the South African football coach faces an uphill battle to form a competitive team without his top players. It is crucial for the coach to adapt to these challenging circumstances by tapping into the available talent, nurturing young players, and fostering a strong team spirit. Doing so will not only help the team navigate through these difficult times but also build a solid foundation for future success. Only time will tell if these strategies can be effectively implemented, leading to a resurgence of Bafana Bafana on the global football stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They released their debut album, Swan Songs, on September 2, 2008, and their live CD/DVD Desperate Measures, on November 10, 2009. Their second studio album, American Tragedy, was released April 5, 2011. All of the band members use pseudonyms and wear their own unique mask, most of which are based on the common hockey goaltender design. Context: The band originated on June 3, 2005, as The Kids from a song titled \\"Hollywood\\" (Later released as \\"The Kids\\") that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Aron Erlichman (Deuce), and Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff) posted on the band's MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends George \\"Johnny 3 Tears\\" Ragan, Jordon \\"Charlie Scene\\" Terrell, Dylan \\"Funny Man\\" Alvarez, and Matthew \\"Da Kurlzz\\" Busek. In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band \\"Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band.\\" Phillips later left the group because of conflict with Erlichman.  The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and their first album, Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008, and reached No.22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009, with two bonus tracks. In April 2009, the band toured with American electronic musician Skrillex as \\"Sonny and the Blood Monkeys\\". On June 23, 2009, Hollywood Undead released Swan Songs B-Sides EP through iTunes.  The band released a CD/DVD set entitled Desperate Measures on November 10, 2009. The set includes a CD of previously unreleased six new songs, three of which are cover songs, as well a previously unreleased remix of \\"Everywhere I Go\\", and six live recordings of songs from Swan Songs, and a DVD of a full live performance by the band. In December 2009, the band won Best Crunk/Rock Rap Artist at the Rock on Request Awards. In its first week of release, Desperate Measures reached No. 29 on the Billboard 200. It also peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard's Rock Albums chart, No. 8 on the Alternative Albums chart, No. 5 on the Hard Rock albums chart, and No. 15 on the Digital Albums chart.

At a London music hall theatre, Richard Hannay is watching a demonstration of the superlative powers of recall of \\"Mr. Memory\\" (Wylie Watson) when shots are fired. In the ensuing panic, Hannay finds himself holding a seemingly frightened Annabella Smith, who talks him into taking her back to his flat. There, she tells him that she is a spy, being chased by assassins, and that she has uncovered a plot to steal vital British military information, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from one of his fingers. She mentions the \\"39 Steps\\", but does not explain its meaning. Later that night Smith, fatally stabbed, bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee. He finds a map of the Scottish Highlands clutched in her hand, showing the area around Killin, with a house or farm named \\"Alt-na-Shellach\\" circled. He sneaks out of his flat disguised as a milkman to avoid the assassins waiting outside. He then boards the Flying Scotsman express train to Scotland. He learns from a newspaper article (read by a pair of women's undergarment salesmen) that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt for Smith's murder. When he sees the police searching the train, he enters a compartment and kisses the sole occupant, Pamela, in a desperate attempt to hide his face and escape detection.

Joe Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner. He was the 20th and 26th head coach in the history of the Washington Redskins (1981-1992, 2004-2007). Well known for his long hours and work ethic, Gibbs constructed what Steve Sabol has called, \\"The most diverse dynasty in NFL history\\", building championship teams with many players who have had mediocre to average careers while playing for other NFL teams. During his first stint in the National Football League, he coached the Redskins for 12 seasons and led them to eight playoff appearances, four NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl titles. Although Gibbs helped craft a passing-oriented attack during his time in San Diego, his Redskins teams were known to incorporate a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack like the counter trey. By building a strong offensive line (known as \\"The Hogs\\") Gibbs was able to control the line of scrimmage, allowing workhorse running backs such as John Riggins, George Rogers, and Earnest Byner to power the ground game. Gibbs added a deep passing attack to this which complemented the ground game, utilizing agile receivers such as Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders. Gibbs' offense was aided during his tenure by aggressive defensive units under the direction of defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon.  Gibbs' system and offensive scheme were robust enough to be successful without a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback at the helm. The Redskins' Super Bowl victories were won featuring Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien--capable players who were very successful along with their strong supporting cast.  Gibbs is credited with inventing the single back, double or triple tight end set. He used it to neutralize Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, realizing that to successfully block him with a running back was impossible; an extra tight end and a tackle were required as well. The extra tight end provided additional protection for the quarterback. Gibbs was also credited for creating the Trips formation; stacking three wide receivers to one side. Gibbs incorporated the shifting and motions for which his offenses were known. The formations created mismatches and confusion for the opposing defenses that would then be exploited. He is also one of few coaches that utilized the H-back position prominently in his offense.","output":"This text is about Joe Jackson Gibbs, a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can some viruses do?\\" is \\"death\\", given that  some viruses can kill? Possible answers: i. Yes. ii. No. A:","output":"While \\"death\\" might be an accurate consequence of some viruses, it is not the most comprehensive or informative answer to the question \\"what can some viruses do?\\"  First, it is essential to understand what a virus is and its different effects on living organisms. Viruses are unique microorganisms that reside at the boundary between living and non-living entities. Unlike other pathogens, viruses are not capable of reproducing independently, instead, they must invade and hijack a host cell to multiply. In the process of replication, various outcomes can arise, depending on the type of virus and its interaction with the host. A more detailed answer would encompass the diverse nature of viruses and their various abilities, which include, but are not limited to: 1. Cause a range of diseases: While some viruses, such as Ebola and certain strains of influenza, can lead to severe illness and death, others cause milder ailments. For example, the common cold is caused by different viruses like rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, while stomach flu results from noroviruses. Some viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), may cause warts, increase the risk of certain cancers or even result in asymptomatic infections. 2. Trigger immune response: When a virus infects a host, the immune system responds by attempting to fight off the invasive pathogen. This process can have various effects on the host, including inflammation, fever, and the generation of specific antibodies, which provide immunity against future exposure to the virus. 3. Establish latency: Certain viruses, such as herpesviruses, can establish a latent or dormant infection in the host. This means that the virus remains hidden within the host's body without causing any symptoms, only to reactivate later, potentially leading to recurrent disease or transmission. 4. Integrate into the host DNA: Some viruses, known as retroviruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have the ability to integrate their genetic material into the host's DNA. This integration can disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to various diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the case of HIV. 5. Act as vectors: Viruses can sometimes serve as carriers for genetic material, introducing new genes or alleles into a host organism. This property has been harnessed in the field of gene therapy and genetic engineering, where modified viruses are used to deliver and integrate exogenous genes into targeted cells for various biomedical and experimental purposes. In summary, although \\"death\\" is one potential outcome of viral infection, it does not fully encapsulate the range of effects caused by viruses. A more accurate and detailed answer would include the various illnesses they can cause, their ability to elicit immune responses, establish latency, integrate into host DNA, and even their potential use as vectors in genetic engineering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less solar panels available happens, how will it affect air is circulated throughout body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case supposes that there is a reduction in the availability of solar panels. To understand whether this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process of air circulation throughout the body, let's first analyze both components - the air circulation process and the role of solar panels in the environment. The air circulation process in the body, as described in the given sequence, entails breathing in oxygen, which enters the lungs through the bronchial tubes. The oxygen then enters the bloodstream, circulates throughout the body, and is exchanged with carbon dioxide in body cells. The carbon dioxide is returned to the lungs via the bloodstream and is expelled through the nose and mouth. This process is crucial for maintaining life, as it ensures that human cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production and cellular metabolism. On the other hand, solar panels are devices that collect sunlight and convert it into electricity, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy supply. They are not directly involved in the biological process of air circulation in the human body. However, it is possible to consider potential indirect effects that may occur from a reduction in the availability of solar panels. If fewer solar panels are available, we may assume that the use of alternative, possibly less environmentally friendly energy sources, such as coal, oil, or natural gas, may increase. The burning of fossil fuels contributes to air pollution by releasing particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other harmful substances, as well as greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Air pollution can have a negative impact on human health, as it can irritate the respiratory system, exacerbate existing respiratory conditions, or even lead to the development of chronic lung disorders. Breathing in polluted air may cause a reduction in the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, as pollutants can damage lung tissue and cause inflammation. The overall air circulation throughout the body might be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in overall health and well-being. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes a reduction in solar panel availability does not directly affect the air circulation process in the human body. However, indirectly, the increased reliance on fossil fuels as an alternative energy source can contribute to air pollution, which can ultimately have an adverse impact on respiratory health and the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain? , can you please find it?   Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

(CNN) -- The battle continues over which court should try the son of deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. In the latest sign of a growing divide, the International Criminal Court on Friday rejected Libya's bid to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and asked the nation to hand him over. Libya has consistently challenged the ICC's demand to try Gadhafi, saying the Hague-based court does not have jurisdiction in the case. Gadhafi, who has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since his capture in 2011, faces charges of crimes against humanity linked to the uprising that ousted his father about two years ago.  OPTIONS: - CNN and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Gadhafi and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Hague and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - ICC and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - International Criminal Court and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Libya and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Libyan and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Moammar Gadhafi and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect. - Zintan and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect.","output":"- Libya and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture, with the court saying the nation is obligated to surrender the suspect.

In the given dialogue, the interaction between the two speakers, F and M, revolves around a particular request. F asks M to give a letter to Mary as soon as she arrives. M obliges and confirms that he will do so. From the conversation, it is clear that M is entrusted with the responsibility of delivering the letter to Mary personally when she comes.  The first option, \\"To see Mary,\\" may seem plausible at first glance since the man is expected to hand over the letter to her. However, it is not the primary action that the man is going to perform. Instead, he is supposed to give her the letter, indicating that his primary objective is the delivery of the letter, not just to see Mary. The second option, \\"To give a letter to Mary,\\" accurately captures the essence of the conversation. F explicitly asks M to hand the letter to Mary, and M agrees to the request. Thus, it is evident that the man's primary intention is to give the letter to Mary as soon as she appears. The third option, \\"To post the letter,\\" does not align with the dialogue. F requests M to give the letter to Mary when she comes, not to post it. Consequently, mailing the letter is not the assigned task for the man in this interaction.

Is it true that does i am number 4 have a sequel?","output":"As of now, there is no official sequel to the 2011 movie, \\"I Am Number Four.\\" The film was adapted from the science fiction novel of the same name written by Pittacus Lore, which is a pseudonym for authors James Frey and Jobie Hughes. The novel is the first in the Lorien Legacies series, which consists of seven books, indicating that there is potential for more movies based on the subsequent novels in the series. However, no sequel has been made or announced. The reason for the lack of a sequel is largely due to the underwhelming performance of \\"I Am Number Four\\" at the box office, as mentioned by screenwriter Marti Noxon in the 2011 statement to Collider.com. The film, produced by DreamWorks Pictures, was not a significant commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. As a result, the producers and studio decided not to greenlight a sequel. While there are no plans for an official film sequel, the story continues in the Lorien Legacies book series. The books, in order of release, are as follows: 1. I Am Number Four (2010) 2. The Power of Six (2011) 3. The Rise of Nine (2012) 4. The Fall of Five (2013) 5. The Revenge of Seven (2014) 6. The Fate of Ten (2015) 7.

I nearly lost my #%u00a5 when I found out there was a Yard House open in Vegas! This one is a perfect addition to the Linq area sandwiched between the Quad and Casino.  If you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians.  Their menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location.  It looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome.  Not sure where to start? My food recommendations are: -Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing. -Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course. -Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good! -French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum. (PS- if you or someone in your group is getting an entree, you save about a 1.50 by adding the soup as a side instead of ordering a la carte.) -Gardein wings: One of the reasons I really enjoy Yard House is that it's vegan and vegetarian friendly. It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings. They are perfect, from bite sized goodness to having a meaty texture that will satisfy and possibly fool some carnivores. -BBQ chicken pizza: Who doesn't love pizza in a bar? This one is top notch. Is this review positive or negative? Choose from: (1). negative. (2). positive. Answer:","output":"(2). positive. This review is positive because the writer talks about their enjoyable experiences at the Yard House.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work \\"The Republic\\". Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the \\"proper\\" distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called \\"reparative justice\\") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who wrote \\"The Republic\\"? 2. What was his nationality? 3. What was his job or occupation, what he is known for? 4.

Which country declared war on Japan - the day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki?","output":"The country that declared war on Japan the day before the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki is the Soviet Union. The end of World War II is largely marked by two pivotal events: the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States, and the invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union.  On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. However, an event of equal significance took place between these two attacks. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. After Germany's surrender in May 1945, the Allies shifted their focus to the Pacific Theater. The Soviet Union had been asked by the other Allies to join the Pacific War and they had agreed during the Yalta Conference that they would intervene on the Allies' side against Japan three months after Germany's surrender. Thus, the Soviet Union declared war to meet the terms agreed upon at the Yalta Conference. It should be noted that this was happening while the Potsdam Conference (which Japan was not a party to) was underway, where the Allies (including the Soviet Union) at Potsdam called on Japan to surrender unconditionally. After its declaration of war, the Soviet Union launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, sometimes known as the Battle of Manchuria. The campaign was one of the largest of the Soviet–Japanese War and ended in a decisive victory for the Soviet Union, Mongolia and China. The twin shocks of the Soviet Union entering the war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki pushed Japan toward surrender. While the debate continues about which event had a bigger influence on Japan's decision to surrender, the fact remains that these two events brought about the end of World War II. The Japanese government officially announced its surrender on August 15, 1945, and the formal signing of surrender documents took place aboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945.  The entry of the Soviet Union into the Pacific War against Japan and the atomic bombings played crucial roles in ending the most devastating conflict in human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When a teacher asks a student to leave the class, the feelings one experiences can vary depending on the individual student's personality, the circumstances behind being asked to leave, and the overall class dynamics. Common emotions experienced in such a situation include: 1. Embarrassment: It's only natural to feel embarrassed when singled out in front of others, as it highlights that the student has done something wrong or unacceptable. Embarrassment often arises from a perceived loss of dignity or a slight to one's reputation. 2. Shame: Similar to embarrassment, shame occurs when one internalizes negative feelings about their actions or behavior. In this case, the student might feel genuine remorse for their conduct in class and might reflect on their actions to avoid future similar situations. 3. Anger or frustration: Some students might react with anger or frustration, particularly if they feel the teacher's request to leave the class is undeserved or unjust. This could lead to feelings of resentment toward the teacher or even the entire school environment. 4. Fear or anxiety: Being asked to leave the class can make a student feel uneasy about what consequences may follow, such as parental involvement, loss of privileges, or a negative impact on their academic record. Fear or anxiety may also arise if the student is unsure of how to navigate the situation or deal with the repercussions. 5. Relief: In some cases, a student may feel relief at being asked to leave the class. They could be struggling with class material, dealing with personal issues, or simply feeling overwhelmed, and the opportunity to step outside momentarily might offer some peace and clarity. 6. Isolation: When a student is asked to leave a class, it can create a sense of separation from the rest of the group. This feeling of isolation may be particularly strong for individuals who have difficulty connecting with their peers or who are already struggling with feelings of loneliness. It is essential to remember that the emotions listed are dependent on the circumstances and individual temperament. Each student's experience will differ, and it's crucial to recognize and empathize with a student's feelings when asked to leave a class. Open communication between the student, teacher, and, if necessary, parents and other supportive figures may help resolve the situation and reduce the negative impact of being asked to leave the class."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Article: Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in Scotland in 1850. He had to end his college studies because his health was poor. He began to travel, looking for a place that was good for his health. And he wrote about his travels. Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe  on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond. In between the two stories about David Belfour came another surprising book, the \\"thriller\\" called The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson died in Samoa in 1894, and he is buried there. Question: Stevenson settled in Samoa because   _  .

Context: On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively. Historian Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.

Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are financial behemoths and political sacred cows - escaping  Which topic is this article about? Options are: (a). World; (b). Sports; (c). Business; (d). Science/Tech;","output":"This article is about: (c). Business.  Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, is one of the leading mortgage companies in the United States. Together with Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, they hold a significant share of the mortgage market. These two financial behemoths are key players in the business world, especially in the housing finance sector. The article in question seems to deal with accounting issues that have been discovered at Fannie Mae, which could potentially affect the company's financial performance and business standing. The mention of lagging reform efforts in Congress also indicates that the topic is related to business and finance regulation. Hence, it falls under the category of Business. To understand better, let's delve deeper into the background of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and their significance in the business world, along with the potential implications of the mentioned accounting artifices. 1. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that help provide liquidity to the US mortgage market. They purchase home loans from banks and other lenders, package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and sell them to investors. By doing so, they ensure that banks have the necessary funds to continue lending to homebuyers. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the US housing market, which has immense impact on the nation's economy. 2. Political influence and involvement: Being government-sponsored entities, they are subject to political considerations as well. Their strong lobbying efforts and influence on policymakers make them a significant force in the world of business and finance. 3. The impact of accounting discrepancies: The article refers to \\"Fannie Mae's newly discovered accounting artifices,\\" which suggests that there have been some questionable accounting practices discovered within the company. The impact of these accounting issues could have wide-ranging implications, including potential financial penalties, legal action, or regulatory changes that could affect Fannie Mae's business operations, financial performance, and investor relations. The fact that this development is mentioned as something that could give \\"lagging reform efforts in Congress some impetus,\\" suggests a possibility of renewed calls for regulatory changes related to mortgage giants, which can further impact the business and financial landscape. In summary, given the focus on Fannie Mae's accounting practices and the potential implications for regulatory reforms and the company's overall business operations, it is clear that the topic of this article belongs to the category of Business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that. Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent. Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent.

How do you make bait to put inside a homemade soda can wasp trap?","output":"Alright, let me explain how to make bait for a homemade soda can wasp trap, step by step! 1. First, we will need a sweet liquid to attract the wasps. You can use any sugary drink like soda, fruit juice, or even sugar water. If you are using sugar water, mix 1 part sugar with 1 part water. Stir it until all the sugar dissolves. 2. Now, let's add a pinch of protein to make it more attractive to the wasps. You can use tiny bits of meat, like lunch meat or hotdog, or even pet food. Add a little bit of this protein into your sweet liquid to make the perfect bait. 3. To create the trap, take an empty soda can and rinse it out well so that it's clean. Next, cut a small hole in the side of the can, near the top. Make sure this hole is big enough for wasps to enter but not so big that they can easily fly out. 4. Pour your bait (the sweet liquid with protein) into the soda can, filling it about halfway. 5. Set your soda can trap up in a place where you have seen wasps, like near their nest or your picnic area. Make sure it's a safe place where kids and pets won't touch it. 6. Wait patiently! The wasps should soon be attracted to the lovely bait inside your soda can. They'll go inside to get to the bait, but have a hard time finding the hole to come back out. Eventually, they'll get trapped inside. Remember to check and empty the trap often, so that it stays effective in catching the wasps. And don't forget to be careful when handling the trap, as the wasps inside may still be able to sting you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? , can you please find it?   A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","output":"The full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I is Philip the Good. He was a significant patron of the arts, especially illuminated manuscripts, and his extensive library helped establish the manuscript industry in the Lowlands, laying the foundation for the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.

Take some guitar wax or polish and gently rub it into the guitar with a rag.  Here is my step-by-step reasoning: 1. Identify the type of polish: Guitar wax or polish is specifically designed for use on guitars and contains the right formulation to enhance the guitar's appearance. Piano wax or polish is designed for pianos and may not be suitable for a guitar's finish. 2. Get a suitable rag: Find a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or rag to apply the polish. This will prevent any damage or scratches to the guitar's surface. 3. Test the polish: Before applying the guitar wax or polish to the entire guitar, test a small amount on a discrete area like the back of the guitar to ensure it doesn't harm the guitar's finish. 4. Apply the polish: If the test area looks good and the finish isn't damaged, gently apply the guitar wax or polish to the entire surface of the guitar using the soft rag. Use small, circular motions to spread the product evenly. 5. Remove excess polish: After allowing the wax or polish to sit on the guitar for the recommended time, gently remove any excess product with a clean, dry section of the rag. This will prevent any build-up or residue on the guitar's surface. 6. Buff the guitar: Once the excess polish has been removed, use another clean, dry section of the rag to buff the guitar's surface. This process will enhance the guitar's shine. By following these steps, the wooden guitar will have an increased shine and look better overall.

Bowe Bergdahl has described in his own words the brutal conditions he endured as a Taliban prisoner for five years, a time during which he said he was kept in constant isolation. Bergdahl also claims he attempted to escape about a dozen times including once where he was able to evade his captors for nine days before being recaptured.      Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      Bergdahl walked away from his unit's outpost in eastern Afghanistan in June, 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban until last May when his freedom was secured in a controversial prisoner swap for five former Taliban leaders being detained at Guantanamo.      On Wednesday the Army charged Bergdahl with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy; he could face life in prison for the latter charge.      Bergdahl’s account of his captivity was included in a statement provided to reporters by his attorney Eugene Fidell, who told ABC News it details “the really atrocious conditions in which he was held” and the worsening treatment after his escape attempts. “I think those are important facts that decision makers will take into account when they figure out how this case should be disposed of,” said Fidell.      “I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light, and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening behind the door I was held behind,\\" wrote Bergdahl in the single-spaced two-page statement.      He said that in the first three months of his captivity after his two escape attempts “I was chained to a bed spread-eagle and blindfolded.” He remained constantly blindfolded except for the few times a day when he was allowed to eat and use the latrine.      As his muscles atrophied and it became difficult for him to walk his captors allowed him to sit chained on the bed. He eventually developed open wounds on his ankles “that looked like the staph infection I had had earlier that year.”      Voice Of Jihad Website/AP video      He also began to develop what he called a “growing internal sickness\\" that made it difficult for him to eat for the rest of his captivity and led to a dramatic weight loss.      After a year of captivity he was placed in a cage with his hands in chains except for the few times when he would wash or change clothes. For a year his feet were chained to the cage every night though that ended “because of the acute pain my feet and legs where [sic] in.” He claims that pain had developed into a “freezing numbness that continues to the present, as both feet have neuropathy.”      He would spend the rest of his captivity in the cage, but unshackled only because it was placed over plumbing that allowed him to relieve himself.      His captors would routinely play mind games with him telling him he would be executed one day, “told I would leave the next day, and the next day told I would be there for 30 years.”      Bergdahl claims he attempted to escape from his captors about a dozen times, the first one taking place just hours after he was captured in 2009 in eastern Afghanistan.      Taken to a village, he claims a Taliban fighter began punching him each time he evaded his questions. Blindfolded with a blanket over his head “I believed I had a chance to run for it and did.” But he was soon brought down by a large group of men who repeatedly punched him including one who used the butt stock of a broken AK-47.      He twice was able to escape beyond the buildings where he was being held. The first time during his first week in captivity when he escaped for 10 to 15 minutes “and after recapturing me and putting chains back on they took turns beating me with a length of thick robber [sic] hose.” Bergdahl said the escape attempt led to his being taken to a more secured compound.      His most daring escape occurred at the end of his first year of captivity when he was able to evade his captors for nine days. “Without food and only putrid water to drink, my body failed on top of a short mountain close to evening.”      He was recaptured a short time later by a large Taliban search group that proceeded to beat him severely. “One tried to rip my beard and hair out, but from what I could sense they where [sic} more worried about getting me out of that area as quickly as possible.” ||||| Washington (CNN) House Speaker John Boehner said Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" after the U.S. military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, but emphasized in an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release.      Bergdahl's attorney also released a statement on Wednesday, outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two-page letter from Bergdahl describing the torture he endured, which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage.      Shortly after the charges were announced, Bergdahl's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to Milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier.      \\"In light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity Sgt. Bergdahl endured, the purpose of his leaving his unit, and his behavior while a prisoner, it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court-martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits,\\" attorney Eugene R. Fidell writes in the letter.      The statement includes a two-page accounting from Bergdahl of his time in captivity, in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed, then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage.      Bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment, and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected.      \\"My body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year,\\" he said.      Bergdahl was frequently beaten, at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose, and forced to watch Taliban videos, he said. He had no concept of time, and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family.      \\"I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door I was held behind,\\" he wrote.      Bergdahl tried a dozen times to escape, he wrote.      In his interview with Bash, Boehner said \\"like any American, you're innocent until proven guilty.\\"      \\"And these charges are coming. There will be a trial,\\" Boehner said in an interview taped Wednesday to air Sunday on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\"      Boehner said the \\"more troubling part\\" of Bergdahl saga is the fact that the U.S. government traded five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release, and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield. He expressed concerns about other detainees held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, which President Barack Obama is working to close, \\"ending up back on the battlefield and threatening Americans here and abroad.\\"      Obama \\"violated the law\\" in failing to alert Congress before the prisoner swap occurred, Boehner added.      \\"And I still believe that's the more troubling part of this,\\" he said. \\"We've made clear in the past that we won't negotiate with terrorists, and but yet here we did.\\"      Military officials announced Wednesday afternoon they would charge Bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.      Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years. For that, he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison, and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank, Army Col. Daniel King said as he announced the charges.      Bergdahl faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate, King said. Then, he could face court martial proceedings.      The decision comes nearly a year after Bergdahl returned to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange and since the Army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009.      The Army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture in December. Until now, it has been in the hands of Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who made the decision to charge Bergdahl. Several U.S. military officials CNN has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected.      Ahead of Wednesday's announcement, officials said Milley only had a few choices. Though the sense had been that Bergdahl must be held accountable for his actions, there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years Bergdahl was held by the Taliban.

But the circumstances of Bergdahl's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear.      King said he couldn't offer those details on Wednesday, and that they're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against Bergdahl.      Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, called the charges an \\"important step\\" on Wednesday.      \\"This is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl,\\" he said in a statement. \\"I am confident that the Department of the Army will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\\"      Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, meanwhile, lambasted the \\"unevenness\\" of Obama's swap of five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl.      \\"I wouldn't have done this trade for a Medal of Honor winner,\\" he told CNN. \\"No military member should expect their country to turn over five Taliban commanders to get their release. Nobody should expect that. It's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it's just the illogical nature of the swap.\\"      Some members of Bergdahl's platoon have criticized him, labeling Bergdahl a deserter.      \\"I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,\\" former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon when he went missing on June 30, 2009, told CNN last year. \\"Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.\\"      Bergdahl was freed in May when President Barack Obama agreed to swap five Taliban prisoners who had been detained in Guantanamo Bay to secure Bergdahl's freedom, sending those detainees to Qatar.      Obama announced Bergdahl's release to fanfare in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the Army sergeant's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl. His hometown of Hailey, Idaho, had planned a parade to celebrate Bergdahl's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release.      After returning to the United States, Bergdahl had been on active duty at an administrative job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. There, the Army assigned Bergdahl a \\"sponsor\\" to help him adjust to life in his new post. Upon returning, Bergdahl refused to meet with his parents -- and months later, Army officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face.      The five figures the United States exchanged to secure Bergdahl's release were Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Nori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime and had been detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda.      The detainee swap for Bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the Taliban. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban for five years, described the really harsh conditions of his captivity. He shared that he was kept in constant isolation, in constant darkness or light, chained and blindfolded, and faced frequent beatings. He said he attempted to escape about twelve times and once managed to avoid capture for nine days.  Bergdahl had previously walked away from his Army outpost in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later freed in 2014 in a controversial prisoner exchange where the US released five Taliban leaders. But, after his return, the Army charged him with desertion and misbehavior. If found guilty, he might face life in prison.  His attorney has provided his account to decision makers as part of his defense case. He hopes that knowing how Bergdahl was treated will impact the decision about his charges.  Also, Bergdahl's health significantly declined during his captivity because of malnutrition and infections from his chains. He was regularly threatened with execution and was continuously played mind games with, being told variously that he would go home, stay for 30 years, or be killed.  The US government's decision to trade five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release has raised concerns as reports suggest one of those fighters has returned to battle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What sort of function are ribozymes capable of?  A: Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Ribozymes are unique RNA molecules possessing catalytic capabilities that allow them to carry out a variety of functions within the cell. Unlike most RNA molecules that function as messengers and templates in protein synthesis, ribozymes are able to perform enzymatic reactions typically reserved for proteins. The discovery of ribozymes has shed light on RNA's versatile nature and its potential for prebiotic life, as well as importance in the evolution of cells. Some of the primary functions of ribozymes include the following: 1. Catalyzing critical cellular processes: Ribozymes play an essential role in many crucial cellular processes, including the synthesis and modification of other RNA molecules. For example, the ribosome, which synthesizes proteins, is made up of a large ribonucleoprotein complex containing ribozymes that facilitate peptide bond formation between amino acids. 2. RNA splicing: Introns, the non-coding regions of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecules, need to be removed before the mRNA is translated into proteins. Ribozymes, such as the Group I and Group II introns, can catalyze their splicing reactions, excising themselves and ligating the adjacent exons together. The spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex, also contains ribozymes responsible for conducting the splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. 3. tRNA processing: One of the foundational participants in the protein synthesis process is transfer RNA (tRNA). Some ribozymes are involved in tRNA maturation, including the removal of the 5' leader sequences and the addition of the essential \\"CCA\\" sequence at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule. 4. RNA replication: In some RNA viruses, ribozymes can participate in RNA replication, mainly by catalyzing the cleavage of precursor RNA molecules and facilitating new RNA strand synthesis. 5. Gene regulation: Ribozymes can also be involved in gene regulation through processes like RNA interference (RNAi). Here, small regulatory RNA molecules guide ribonucleoprotein complexes, which contain ribozymes, to bind and cleave target messenger RNAs, thus modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. 6. Catalytic aptamers: Certain ribozymes, called catalytic aptamers, are capable of binding and catalyzing reactions on small molecules, such as cofactors, metal ions, and metabolites. Some examples include the glmS ribozyme, which functions in the regulation of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthesis, and the hammerhead ribozyme, which is involved in the processing of certain viral RNAs. In summary, ribozymes are multifunctional RNA molecules capable of catalyzing various biological reactions. They play a critical role in many cellular processes such as RNA splicing, tRNA processing, RNA replication, and gene regulation. The versatility and significance of ribozymes have broadened our understanding of RNA's central role in cellular biology and evolution, making them a fascinating area of study."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you live in a temperate or warm climate, nearly all plant nurseries in your area should sell jacaranda seedlings. If you need help locating a jacaranda plant, or if a nursery has different options to choose from, ask the sales staff for assistance. If there isn’t a plant nursery in your area, you can also visit the Garden section of large retail stores. Retailers like WalMart and Home Depot will stock a large variety of plants, and will likely carry jacaranda seedlings. If you don’t live near a nursery or garden center, there may not be a way for you to purchase a jacaranda seedling in person. In this case, you can find and order a jacaranda online. Check major online plant retailers, such as Annie’s Annuals, Fast Growing Trees, or Nursery Live. Certain retailers will provide a seedling—with others, you may need to order a packet of seeds. Although jacarandas commonly grow in temperate or humid climates, they can survive in cooler areas as well—even regions that receive light frosts. Jacaranda trees grow best in zone 10 in the hardiness scale, which includes warmer climates. If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask if you can take a cutting of their plant. A cutting is segment taken from a branch; the cutting itself should be at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, but can be as long as you would like. Place the jacaranda cutting in water until small roots begin to emerge. Then, plant the cutting in a small pot filled with rich soil, water regularly, and let the tree grow. Jacaranda seedlings also tend to spring up around the base of mature jacaranda trees. If you can safely and legally dig up one of these seedlings, you can transplant it into a planter and so begin growing your own tree.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What are some causes of a small lump in my earlobe? A small lump in the earlobe can be caused by several factors, which may include the following: 1. Epidermoid cyst: Also called a sebaceous cyst, an epidermoid cyst is a common, benign (non-cancerous) lump filled with dead skin cells and keratin. It appears under the skin and is usually painless, but may become painful if infected. 2. Pimple or acne: Blocked hair follicles can result in the formation of a pimple or a small, red, and sometimes painful lump. 3. Trauma or injury: A minor injury or trauma to the earlobe can cause a small lump or swelling. 4. Keloid: A keloid is an overgrown scar that occurs when the body overproduces collagen, forming a smooth, hard, raised lump after an injury. 5. Infection: Bacterial or fungal infections can cause small lumps in the earlobe. Infections may be painful or accompanied by discharge. 6. Piercings: A lump near an ear piercing could be due to an irritation or infection from the jewelry or improper healing. 7. Lipoma: A lipoma is a soft, fatty growth that occurs just below the skin, forming a rounded lump. Lipomas are benign and usually painless. 8. Benign or cancerous growth: Although rare, a small lump in the earlobe could be a result of a benign or cancerous growth. Question 2: Why do I have a lump in my neck? A lump in the neck can be caused by various factors, some of which include: 1. Lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes are the most common cause of neck lumps. Lymph nodes can become enlarged for several reasons, such as infections, inflammation, or cancer. 2. Thyroid disorders: An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) can cause a lump in your neck. Thyroid disorders that can lead to a goiter include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or thyroid nodules. 3. Cysts: Cysts in the neck area can develop as a result of trapped cells, fluid, or other substances. Thyroglossal duct cysts and branchial cleft cysts are examples of neck cysts. 4. Lipoma: A lipoma is a soft, fatty growth that occurs just below the skin, forming a rounded lump. Lipomas can develop anywhere on the body, including the neck. 5. Infections: Bacterial or viral infections can cause neck lumps. Infections in oral tissues, such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or dental abscesses, can lead to swollen lymph nodes in the neck area. 6. Cancer: Although rare, a lump in your neck could be caused by cancer, such as thyroid cancer, lymphoma, or cancer that has spread from another part of the body. Comparing the two questions, it is clear that they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically asking about the causes of a small lump in the earlobe, whereas Question 2 is concerned with the causes of a lump in the neck area. While some potential reasons for the lumps may overlap, such as infection or lipomas, the specific causes and associated conditions for each location are different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness.  - Matthew Richard \\"Matt\\" Stone (born May 26, 1971) is an American actor, animator, writer, director, producer, singer, and songwriter. He is known for co-creating \\"South Park\\" (1997present) along with his creative partner Trey Parker, as well as co-writing the Tony Award-winning musical \\"The Book of Mormon\\" (2011).

The Musical\\" (1993).  - A punishment is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authorityin contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal lawas a response and deterrent to a particular action or behaviour that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the lawand respect for rule of lawunder which the social group is governed. Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion.   - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Alfred Griner \`\` Alferd '' Packer ( January 21 , 1842 -- April 23 , 1907 ) was an American prospector who confessed to cannibalism during the winter of 1874 . He and 5 other men attempted to travel through the high mountains of Colorado during the peak of a harsh winter . When only Alfred reached civilization , he claimed that the others had killed each other for food , and confessed to having lived off the flesh of his companions during his snowbound state and to having used it to survive his trek out of the mountains two months later . After his story was called into question , he hid from justice for 9 years before being tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death . Packer won a retrial and was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison for manslaughter . A biopic of his life , The Legend of Alfred Packer , was made in 1980 . A more comedic take entitled Cannibal ! The Musical was made in 1993 .  - Sexual cannibalism is when a female cannibalizes her mate prior to, during, or after copulation. It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most arachnid orders, as well as several insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression.  - The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States. Because European settlement in the U.S. expanded westward after its founding, the meaning of the West has evolved over time. Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier.  - Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The expression \\"cannibalism\\" has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism.  - Dian Bachar (born October 26, 1970 in Denver, Colorado) is an American actor most notable for his roles in various films by or starring his friends Trey Parker and Matt Stone, such as \\"Cannibal!

Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until they are brought to trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. Besides their use for punishing civil crimes, jails and prisons are frequently used by authoritarian regimes.  - \\"Classical Gas\\" is an instrumental musical piece composed and originally performed by Mason Williams with instrumental backing by members of the Wrecking Crew. Originally released in 1968 on the album \\"The Mason Williams Phonograph Record\\", it has been re-recorded and re-released numerous times since by Williams. One later version served as the title track of a 1987 album by Williams and the band Mannheim Steamroller.  - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census.  - Cannibal! The Musical (originally known as Alferd Packer: The Musical) is a 1993 American independent black comedy musical film directed, written, produced, co-scored by and starring Trey Parker while studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder, before reaching fame with \\"South Park\\" alongside his friend Matt Stone who also stars in and produced the film. It is loosely based on the true story of Alferd Packer and the sordid details of the trip from Utah to Colorado that left his five fellow travelers dead and partially eaten. Trey Parker (credited as Juan Schwartz) stars as Alferd Packer, with frequent collaborators Stone, Dian Bachar, and others playing the supporting roles.  - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.  - South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the television network, Comedy Central. The show revolves around four boysStan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormickand their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"South Park\\" uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom.

Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\"      Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed.      Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny.      If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest   for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\"      When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video.  After reading the above, is \\"Watching a car drive\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are three examples of density given in the article?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Watching a car drive\\" is not one of the examples of density given in the article. The three examples of density-related phenomena mentioned in the article are: 1. Helium balloons rising: This occurs because helium is less dense than air. When a balloon is filled with helium, the overall density of the balloon becomes less than the surrounding air. Due to this difference in density, the balloon experiences a buoyant force, causing it to rise. 2. Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream: Density differences in ocean water, which are primarily influenced by temperature and salinity, create pressure gradients. These gradients drive the movement of water, forming currents like the Gulf Stream. Warmer, less dense water tends to flow toward colder, denser regions, while colder, denser water sinks and moves beneath the warmer water layers. 3. Floating or sinking of objects in water: This is determined by relative densities of the objects and water. If an object has a lower density than water, it will experience a buoyant force greater than its own weight, causing it to float. On the other hand, if an object has a higher density than water, the buoyant force will be less than its weight, causing it to sink. The video mentioned in the article is another example involving the interaction between vegetable oil and water. Since vegetable oil has a lower density than water, it floats on top of water, creating a visually appealing demonstration of density differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll. Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen. But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone. And as in so much of Syria's war, it has been that way for months and will probably go on so, as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up: the fight for a small hill called OPTIONS: - Aleppo. - CNN. - Handarat. - ISIS. - Syrian.","output":"The appropriate next sentence for the given paragraph would be: Handarat. Here's why: The paragraph discusses the horrors in Aleppo that have been largely forgotten due to the world's focus shifting towards ISIS. It also mentions that the fight against this forgotten crisis will persist because the outcome is vital. This implies that the ensuing sentence should name or detail a specific locus of such fight. Among the options given, ISIS and CNN aren't apt since ISIS is something else the world is focusing on, not the forgotten crisis, while CNN is merely the publisher. The place under discussion is Aleppo, so repeating it doesn't add new information. 'Syrian' might seem like a contender, but it doesn't specifically add depth to where the conflict is occurring, which we can presume the concluding sentence should discuss. Given the context, Handarat, which is a strategic location near Aleppo and an actual point of conflict during the Syrian civil war, is the optimal choice to bridge the discorso, providing precise information and moving the narrative forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in a plant - The light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide - The plant uses nutrients in the soil - The plant uses carbon dioxide in the air to produce glucose - The plant uses the glucose to give itself energy - Oxygen is released as a by product.  Question: suppose more light energy absorbed happens, how will it affect more sugar produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll in a plant, it can lead to an increase in the production of glucose, or sugar, through the process of photosynthesis. This is because the additional light energy provides the plant with a greater capacity to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis is, however, not a direct linear one because at a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis plateaus as it becomes limited by other factors like carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and nutrients. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the use of carbon dioxide to produce glucose, the increased absorption of light energy will likely have a positive effect on the process. As the plant absorbs more light energy, it has more energy available to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose. This enhanced rate of photosynthesis, in turn, increases the overall efficiency and productivity of the conversion process, leading to the production of more sugar for the plant's energy needs. However, as mentioned earlier, the rate of photosynthesis depends on various factors, including the availability of carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide concentration in the vicinity of the plant does not increase or is not sufficient to match the increased light energy absorbed, the plant may not be able to optimize the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose even if it has enough energy to do so. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of increased light energy absorption can lead to more sugar produced in a plant, but this effect might be limited by other factors like carbon dioxide availability, temperature, and nutrients. To optimize sugar production in response to increased light energy absorption, a balanced supply of all these necessary ingredients is essential for the plant to achieve its full potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I also know that it hasn't always been easy for you and Mom, and that as excited as you both are about that new puppy, it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about why I decided to take our family on this _  When I was a young man, I thought life was all about me--about how I'd make my way in the world, become successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my world with all your curiosity and mischief and those smiles that never fail to fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't count for much unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential--schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college--even if their parents aren't rich. And I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with dignity. I want us to push the boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and inventions that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and region, gender and religion that keep us from seeing the best in each...

Robin Williams was sober but was struggling with depression, anxiety and the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died, his widow said Thursday. The diagnosis of the progressive illness was \\"an additional fear and burden in his life,\\" a person familiar with Williams' family told CNN on Thursday. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home Monday from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. While fans and friends have looked for answers to why the 63-year-old comedy icon would take his own life, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a written statement about Williams' health that he had kept a secret. \\"Since his passing, all of us who loved Robin have found some solace in the tremendous outpouring of affection and admiration for him from the millions of people whose lives he touched,\\" Schneider said. \\"His greatest legacy, besides his three children, is the joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles. \\"Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly. \\"It is our hope in the wake of Robin's tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid.\\" Williams had been active as an actor in the last year of his life, performing in a CBS sitcom that was canceled this year and acting in four films that have yet to hit theaters. It is not clear whether the early-stage Parkinson's disease affected his ability to work. \\"Friends and family can usually detect changes in the Parkinson's patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions,\\" according to the National Parkinson Foundation. \\"During this initial phase of the disease, a patient usually experiences mild symptoms.  These symptoms may inconvenience the day-to-day tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease. Typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs.\\" Parkinson's disease \\"causes certain brain cells to die,\\" according to the website of the National Institutes of Health.  It is more likely to affect men than women and most often develops after age 50. Williams used exercise and cycling to manage his stress and depression, and the prospect that the illness would prevent him from doing that was extremely upsetting, adding to the depression, the person familiar with his family said. What is Parkinson's disease? Fellow actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's and established the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said Thursday that he was unaware of his friend's condition. \\"Stunned to learn Robin had PD. Pretty sure his support for our Fdn predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace,\\" Fox tweeted. Investigators believe Williams used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late Sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon Monday, according to Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd. Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss \\"the note or a note\\" later. The coroner's investigation \\"revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression,\\" Boyd said. He spent time in a treatment facility in July, a time when his wife and representative have said he was battling depression. Media reports at the time speculated that Williams had resumed drinking alcohol, but the statement from his wife appears to dispute those reports. Williams entered rehab because of drug and alcohol addiction at least twice previously. \\"Robin spent so much of his life helping others,\\" his wife said.

The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law.  - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced.

Goffredo and Eustazio are told by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword.

Write an article based on this summary: The Paris attacks have once again revealed the West's bewilderment as to why it is under attack.","output":"Title: Why is the West Under Attack? A Simple Explanation of the Paris Attacks Once upon a time, there were many countries in the world. Some of these countries were in a place called the West. One day, something bad happened in the city of Paris, which is in a country called France, in the West. Many people were hurt, and some even lost their lives. This made everyone very sad. People couldn't understand why this had happened and wondered why it took place in the West. To help us understand why the West is under attack, let's first talk about what the West is. The \\"West\\" is a way of describing some countries that are in Europe and North America. These countries are often called \\"western\\" because when you look at a map of the world, they are on the left side or the \\"west\\" side. These countries include places like France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.  There are different reasons why some people might want to cause harm in the West. Many times, these people feel angry about the choices that countries in the West make. This could be because of the way western countries run their governments, treat other people around the world, or even choose what is right and wrong. Some of the people who are unhappy with the West blame them for the problems in their own countries. These problems might include things like not having enough food, not being able to find a good job, or feeling like their voices aren't being heard. To express their anger and frustration, these people sometimes decide to hurt others. In the case of the Paris attacks, a group of individuals who were very mad at the West planned and carried out the attacks. They wanted to hurt the people in Paris to show their anger and let everyone know that they didn't like the choices that the West was making. Now, it's important to remember that not everyone who is unhappy with the West will choose to hurt other people. There are many ways to share your feelings or try to make changes without causing harm. For example, people can form groups to talk and discuss their problems or use their voices to say what they think is right. We also need to remember that the West is made up of many people who come from different places, believe in different things, and have different opinions. It's not fair to blame all the people who live in the West for the choices their governments make or the actions of a few individuals. In the end, understanding why the West is under attack is not easy, nor is it the same for everyone. We need to listen carefully to what people are saying and learn from their feelings and ideas. By doing so, we can work together to find ways to improve the world and make sure everybody is living happily and peacefully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up: \\"And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?\\" Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say.

News article: Insurers Weigh In on Health Care Law The health insurance industry is urging the Supreme Court to decide as quickly as it can whether the federal health care law is, in fact, constitutional and to consider what other parts of the law should be struck down if the individual mandate does not pass muster. America’s Health Insurance Plans, a Washington, D.C., trade group, filed its supporting brief on Tuesday about the case. The group represents the nation’s health insurance companies, many of which oppose crucial provisions of the Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Obama last year. The group argued that insurers need to know as soon as possible if the new law will be upheld. because businesses need to “make and implement numerous critical decisions now to ensure their ability to comply as requirements come into effect in the coming years.” Many of the law’s most sweeping provisions go into effect in 2014. The Obama administration says the law is constitutional and has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case quickly. Several lower courts have issued differing opinions on the law, which was challenged in court by many states. Right now, the insurers say they don’t know if the whole law will be struck down or just parts of it or whether all of the legislation will be deemed constitutional. “All of this paralyzing uncertainty—among health plans, employers, government regulators and others — underscores the vital need for a prompt and conclusive resolution of the constitutional challenge to the individual mandate. AHIP therefore respectfully urges the court to grant review of that issue and to resolve it this term,” the insurers say. The insurers also say that without the individual mandate, which would require people to buy insurance, the law is essentially unworkable. They point out that there are concerns over adverse selection, where only the people who think they need coverage buy insurance, and cite numerous examples of failed efforts by the states. “All of that evidence underscores the very real likelihood that implementation of ACA’s market reforms in the absence of the individual mandate would confound the legislation’s central goal of increasing the availability of affordable health care coverage. Congress, moreover, enacted the individual mandate in conjunction with its market reforms because it was acutely aware of the widespread difficulties that had arisen from the efforts of states to implement similar insurance market reforms without the economic counterbalance of an individual mandate,” the insurers say. Is the individual mandate constitutional? If the Supreme Court strikes it down, should the rest of the health care law be allowed to stand? Should everyone be required to have health insurance? This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the position taken by America's Health Insurance Plans on the overall federal health legislation. It is not asking the court to consider striking down the law altogether, but seeking consideration as to whether other pieces of the law should be overturned if the individual mandate is ruled unconstitutional.

Summarize this article: It was \\"planned and operated\\" from late 2011 - including the build-up to London 2012 - and continued through the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics until August 2015. An investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says Russia's sports ministry \\"directed, controlled and oversaw\\" manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes. It says Russian athletes benefited from what the report called the \\"Disappearing Positive Methodology\\", whereby positive doping samples would go missing. International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach described the commission's findings as a \\"shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games\\" and pledged to enforce the \\"toughest sanctions available\\" against those implicated. The IOC will decide on Tuesday about any \\"provisional measures and sanctions\\" for the Rio Olympics, which start on 5 August. A mind-blowing level of corruption within both Russian sport and government that goes right to the field of play The commission, led by Canadian law professor and sports lawyer Dr Richard McLaren, looked into allegations made by the former head of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. Grigory Rodchenkov claimed he doped dozens of athletes before the 2014 Winter Olympics, which were held in Sochi, Russia. Rodchenkov - described by the Kremlin as a \\"scandalous\\" former official - also alleged he had been helped by the Russian secret service, the FSB. He claimed they had worked out how to open and reseal supposedly tamper-proof bottles that were used for storing urine samples so the contents could be replaced with \\"clean\\" urine. McLaren sent a random amount of stored samples from \\"protected Russian athletes\\" at Sochi 2014 to an anti-doping laboratory in London to see if they had scratch marks around the necks of the bottles that would indicate they had been manipulated. McLaren said \\"100% of the bottles had been scratched\\" but added that would \\"not have been visible to the untrained eye\\". He said he had \\"unwavering confidence\\" in all of his findings. The damning report does not make any recommendations, but will fuel calls for a complete ban on Russia from the 2016 Summer Olympics. Wada has recommended the IOC \\"decline entries, for Rio 2016, of all athletes\\" submitted by the Russian Olympic Committee and the Russian Paralympic Committee. Russian government officials should also be banned from this summer's Games, it said. Wada president Sir Craig Reedie called the \\"scope and scale\\" of the findings a \\"real horror story\\". President Vladimir Putin made the Sochi Games a showcase event and spent more than 50bn (£37.7bn) staging them. On Monday, Putin said officials named in the McLaren report would be suspended, pending a thorough investigation. But a statement released by the Kremlin criticised the report as \\"accusations against Russian athletes\\" based on the the testimony of \\"a person with a scandalous reputation\\". It also warned of a \\"dangerous recurrence of interference of politics in sport\\". Putin has asked Wada to provide \\"more complete, objective, evidence-based information\\" to Russian investigators. BBC sports editor Dan Roan: \\"How could all this have gone on under the noses of the IOC and Wada for years, in a Wada-accredited lab? Why did it take a whistleblower to unearth the corruption? And will this scandal split the Olympic movement beyond repair?\\" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway: \\"It's a lot worse than people were expecting. I've read through some of the report and 580 positive tests were covered up across 30 different sports. We are into the world of James Bond-style espionage.\\" United States Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart: \\"The McLaren Report has concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, a mind-blowing level of corruption within both Russian sport and government that goes right to the field of play… and most importantly, our hearts go out to athletes from all over the world who were robbed of their Olympic dreams.\\" British Olympic 400m silver medallist Roger Black on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It's about as bad as it could possibly be. I'm not naive, I know certain people will take drugs, but I've always said this is a minority of people. The problem now, when you're looking at a Russian athlete, is you won't be thinking that.\\" Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"I think that a level of institutionalised doping, of institutionalised cheating and fraud to sport, which has done such damage to every sport globally has to be punished strongly. Unfortunately there will be some innocent athletes from Russia that will suffer from that ban.\\" British European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It's just awful. You feel sorry for any clean athletes in Russia who have put their hearts and souls into qualifying for the Olympics. At the same time, so many are in this system that a strong message needs to be sent out.\\" Lord Coe, president of the IAAF, athletics' world governing body: \\"The institutionalised and systematic doping in Russian athletics is the reason the IAAF suspended, and then upheld the suspension of, Russia Athletics Federation's membership and consequently the exclusion of their athletes from international competition.\\" UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead: \\"Now is the time for the entire sporting community to come together to find a way forward and ensure the right processes, legislation and safeguards are in place to protect the rights of all athletes to clean, fair and honest competition.\\" International Paralympic Committee president Sir Philip Craven: \\"We are truly shocked, appalled and deeply saddened at the extent of the state-sponsored doping programme implemented in Russia ahead of Sochi 2014. The findings of the McLaren Report mark a very dark day for sport.\\" UK sports minister Tracey Crouch: \\"Professor McLaren's report has exposed the extreme lengths some will go to in order to cheat. This shocking report is a wake-up call to the sporting world.\\" Bill Sweeney, British Olympic Association chief, and Ben Hawes, chair of the BOA Athletes' Commission (joint statement): \\"This report realises the worst fears of clean athletes everywhere.\\" Gary Anderson, coach of the British bobsleigh team, told BBC Radio 4's PM: \\"At Sochi, we were beaten to a medal by two Russian sleds. The revelations are greater than we anticipated so there's a lot more questions to be asked.\\" The report said Russia's \\"Disappearing Positive Methodology\\" worked when analysis could be done at the Moscow laboratory. But at an international event - such as London 2012, the Athletics World Championships of 2013, or the Swimming World Championships of 2015 - Russia had to adapt its methods. The report found: It was \\"inconceivable\\" that Russia's sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, was not aware of the doping cover-up scheme, according to the report. Mutko has been in position since 2008. He is a member of the executive committee of football's world governing body, Fifa, and chairs the organising committee of the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia. The report claimed Mutko personally intervened to cover up a doping case of \\"at least\\" one overseas football player in the Russian league and that 11 positive tests by Russia footballers disappeared. However, it was Mutko's deputy, Yuri Nagornykh, who was advised of \\"every positive analytical finding\\" from the Moscow laboratory from 2011 onwards - in \\"total violation\\" of Wada rules - and decided who to protect. Media playback is not supported on this device The commission was set up to look into Rodchenkov's claims that he doped dozens of athletes, including at least 15 medallists, in the build-up to Sochi. He claims this was the result of an elaborate and orchestrated plot with the Russian government, which exploited its host status to subvert the drug-testing programme. The country's government has repeatedly denied the claims. Rodchenkov, now in hiding in the US, also alleges he doped athletes before the 2012 Olympics in London, the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow and the 2015 World Swimming Championships in Kazan. Yes. The country's track and field athletes are barred from competing in Rio after the body that governs world athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations, voted in June to maintain a global competition ban on the All-Russia Athletic Federation (Araf). Araf hopes to overturn the suspension and will find out by Thursday if its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport has been successful. Whatever happens, a small number of Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be allowed to compete at the Rio Games under the flag of the IOC.","output":"A report commissioned for the World Anti-Doping Agency has discovered that between 2011 and 2015, the Russian Sports Ministry directed and controlled an \\"unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and the Olympic Games.\\" Overseen by Canadian law professor, Dr Richard McLaren, the investigation discovered a massive level of corruption both in Russian sport and the government, which has since led to the International Olympic Committee to consider banning the entire Russian team from the Summer Olympics.

Pitcairn Island selects its first woman mayor in its 214-year history after its former mayor - a convicted rapist - was sacked last week.","output":"This event is about the appointment of the first female mayor on Pitcairn Island, a significant moment in the island's 214-year history. Pitcairn Island is a small British Overseas Territory located in the South Pacific Ocean. It has a population of around 50 people, which makes it the least populous national jurisdiction in the world. The former mayor of Pitcairn, who was convicted for rape, was dismissed from his position last week. This made way for the election of the first female mayor in the island's long history, showcasing an essential development in the region's political sphere. Although the island has relatively low levels of political activity due to its small population, the appointment of a female mayor signals a critical milestone for gender equality on Pitcairn Island. The event highlights the progress towards empowering women and providing them with opportunities to lead and represent their community. Historically, like in many other parts of the world, women on Pitcairn Island have faced various kinds of discrimination, which limited their opportunities in various aspects, including politics. However, the election of the first woman mayor signifies a shift in societal attitudes and represents the growing recognition of women's rights and capabilities. Furthermore, this event sheds light on the importance of addressing issues related to sexual assault and the enforcement of the law, even in remote and small communities such as Pitcairn Island. The dismissal of the former mayor due to his criminal conviction underscores the community's commitment to upholding justice, irrespective of individuals' political standing. This historical event on Pitcairn Island exemplifies the growing global trend towards gender equality and the increased involvement of women in decision-making processes. The appointment of the first female mayor supports the broader movement advocating for equal representation for women in political leadership positions. It also brings attention to the potential impact of positive role models, particularly for young girls and women, on the island. In conclusion, the selection of the first woman mayor on Pitcairn Island is a significant development in the island's political landscape. It symbolizes the increasing recognition of women's rights, capabilities, and contributions to society, reflecting broader global trends toward gender equality. This appointment, combined with the dismissal of the former mayor due to his criminal conviction, highlights the importance of upholding the rule of law and addressing social issues such as sexual assault in all communities, regardless of their size or location. Ultimately, this event demonstrates the potential for positive change and increased representation for women in positions of power and influence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No flooding , though the water came within a foot or two of becoming dangerous . The ravine is an unplanned detention pond of sorts . More than one friend of mine has a home that filled with flood waters . Question: What might be happening that we are having severe flooding in our area ?","output":"There could be several reasons behind the severe flooding in your area. Some of the main factors include: 1. Climate change: Rising global temperatures can result in more intense storms, heavier rainfall, and increased snowmelt, which may lead to flooding. Climate change can also cause sea levels to rise, contributing to more frequent coastal flooding. 2. Urbanization: As more land is developed with impermeable surfaces like roads, parking lots, and buildings, less water can be absorbed into the soil. This increases the amount of runoff during storms, and the stormwater drainage systems can become overloaded, leading to flooding. 3. Deforestation: The removal of trees and vegetation can reduce the land's ability to absorb and store water. In turn, this results in increased surface runoff and higher likelihood of flooding, particularly in areas with steep slopes. 4. Poor land management: Inappropriate land use practices, such as farming on steep hillsides or building homes in flood-prone areas, can contribute to flooding. Additionally, inadequate maintenance of stormwater management infrastructure, like clogged drainage systems, can also lead to flooding. 5. Changes in river systems: Natural factors, such as erosion, sedimentation, or a change in river channel geometry, can lead to increased flood risk. Human activities, like constructing dams, levees, or floodwalls, can also alter river systems and potentially exacerbate flooding if not appropriately designed and maintained. 6. Extreme weather events: Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy rainfall, can cause significant flooding. These events can overwhelm drainage systems and lead to flash floods, river floods, and coastal floods. 7. Soil saturation: Prolonged periods of rainfall can cause soil to become saturated, reducing its capacity to absorb more water. When additional rain falls, it has nowhere to go, resulting in an increased risk of flooding. 8. Snowmelt and ice jams: In colder climates, rapid snowmelt or ice jams in rivers can cause a sudden release of water, leading to flooding. 9. Tidal and storm surges: Coastal areas can experience flooding due to tidal surges and storm surges during powerful storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters. This can be exacerbated by sea-level rise resulting from climate change, as mentioned earlier. To address these issues, several measures can be implemented: 1. Implementing stricter land use regulations and zoning policies to avoid development in flood-prone areas. 2.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person Thespis declines to flirt with? , can you please find it?   Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth.  Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.  They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.  Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence.  Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.  Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need. Answer:","output":"The name of the person Thespis declines to flirt with is Nicemis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Show genuine interest in them, and she'll appreciate the effort. You don't have to fake enthusiasm, or even fully understand what she's talking about. Just make an effort to follow her explanations. Don't take the relationship for granted. Set aside time to give each other your full attention, and put in the effort to make it feel special. Does she stop to pet dogs on the street? Did she call something you did cute in conversation? Make a mental note of these moments, and she'll probably tell you everything you can do to make her smile without even knowing it. \\"Sexy\\" and \\"gorgeous\\" can be great in the right context, but people need recognition on other levels as well. Make sure your girlfriend knows you appreciate her intellect and skill. Every relationship is different. Remember to think of what your girlfriend enjoys, instead of repeating what worked on your last significant other. Sometimes, you have to let your girlfriend be mad, or sad, or whatever it is she's feeling. If she's going through a rough emotional time, don't tell her that everything's okay or that she just needs to cheer up.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: John doesn't understand triangles, but that's why he's taking the class on what? Possible A: trigonometry, music room, mathematics, music shop, algebra  Why is \\"trigonometry\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Trigonometry\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most relevant subject when it comes to the study of triangles. In the context of the question, John has difficulty with triangles, so he would be more likely to take a class related to understanding triangles, their properties, and the relationships between their angles and sides. Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals specifically with these aspects of triangles, making it the most logical and reasonable choice among the possible answers listed. As for the other options: - A music room and music shop are unrelated to the study of triangles, as these options pertain to music and not mathematics or geometry. - Algebra is a branch of mathematics, but it is not focused on triangles and their properties. It mainly deals with operations and relationships between mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations. - Mathematics is a broader field that encompasses various branches, including trigonometry. However, among all the possible answers provided, trigonometry is the most specific and relevant topic in relation to the study of triangles. Hence, \\"trigonometry\\" is the answer that best aligns with human common sense in this context due to its direct association with the study and understanding of triangles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
