Context: In the middle of 1984 a Brazilian company called Prológica, which made its own versions of 8 bits US computers, brought to the Brazilian market a new equipment for its personal computer series called \\"CP\\" (shorten of Personal Computer in Portuguese). Hypothesis: Prológica violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to Brazilian markets.","output":"From the provided context, we can generate a hypothesized argument that Prológica may have violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to the Brazilian market. However, we must acknowledge that this hypothesis is only based on the limited information available, and drawing a definite conclusion would require thorough research and analysis of existing copyright and intellectual property laws, the specific technologies used by Prológica and how they relate to the US computers in question, as well as any potential licensing or agreements made between Prológica and the original creators of the US computers. Let's break down this hypothesis into several factors that could support or debunk it for a better understanding: 1. Copyright and intellectual property laws: When investigating potential copyright violations, it is crucial to consider the laws governing such issues in both the United States and Brazil. If Prológica had manufactured exact replicas or substantially similar versions of the US computers that infringed upon specific copyrights or patents held by US companies, the hypothesis could carry merit. 2. Technological similarities: In order to warrant a violation claim, the technologies employed in Prológica's \\"CP\\" series would need to be examined closely to identify any likeness to the US computers that go beyond fundamental design aspects inherent to personal computers in general. A careful analysis could reveal whether the similarities were unintentional or rather a deliberate attempt to replicate proprietary technologies. 3. Licensing agreements: It is possible that Prológica had entered into licensing agreements with the original creators of the US computers, allowing them to legally manufacture and distribute their 8-bit personal computers in Brazil. If such an agreement was in place, then the hypothesis loses its foundation. 4. Market factors: The economic climate, consumer demand, and competitive landscape of the Brazilian market in 1984 would also offer insights into why Prológica chose to introduce its versions of US computers into the market. It may be an essential context for understanding whether their actions were driven by a desire to exploit a market opportunity or to deliberately violate existing US computer copyrights. In summary, the hypothesis that Prológica violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to the Brazilian market is an interesting proposition that warrants further investigation. To validate or debunk this hypothesis, a detailed examination of the factors listed above, as well as any additional information relevant to the situation, should be conducted."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Many planners and advisors require that their clients have an investment portfolio of at least a minimum value, sometimes 100,000 or more. This means it could be hard to find an advisor willing to work with you if your portfolio isn't well established. In that case, look for an advisor interested in helping smaller investors. How do financial planners help? Planners are professionals whose job is to invest your money for you, ensure that your money is safe, and guide you in your financial decisions. They draw from a wealth of experience at allocating resources. Most importantly, they have a financial stake in your success: the more money you make under their tutelage, the more money they make. The herd instinct, alluded to earlier, is the idea that just because a lot of other people are doing something, you should, too.  Many successful investors have made moves that the majority thought were unwise at the time.  That doesn't mean, however, that you should never seek investment advice from other people. Just be wise about choosing the people you listen to. Friends or family members with a successful background in investing can offer worthwhile advice, as can professional advisors who charge a flat fee (rather than a commission) for their help. Invest in smart opportunities when other people are scared. In 2008 as the housing crisis hit, the stock market shed thousands of points in a matter of months. A smart investor who bought stocks as the market bottomed out enjoyed a strong return when stocks rebounded. This reminds us to buy low and sell high. It takes courage to buy investments when they are becoming cheaper (in a falling market) and sell those investments when they are looking better and better (a rising market). It seems counter-intuitive, but it's how the world's most successful investors made their money. Your life and conditions in the market change all the time, so your investment strategy should change with them. Never be so committed to a stock or bond that you can't see it for what it's worth.  While money and prestige may be important, never lose track of the truly important, non-material things in life: your family, friends, health, and happiness.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5d/Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg/v4-460px-Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/5/5d/Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg/aid1319046-v4-728px-Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  For example, if you are very young and saving for retirement, it may be appropriate to have most of your portfolio invested in stocks or stock funds. This is because you would have a longer time horizon in which to recover from any big market crashes or declines, and you would be able to benefit from the long-term trend of markets moving higher. If you are just about to retire, however, having much less of your portfolio in stocks, and a large portion in bonds and/or cash equivalents is wise. This is because you will need the money in the short-term, and as a result you do not want to risk losing the money in a stock market crash right before you need it.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start.

Hello, little friends! In this article, we are going to find out which company was second best in the market in August of 1997. It was a long time ago, so we will try to make this journey fun and exciting for you! In the year 1997, many companies were trying to become number one. It's like a race where everyone wants to run the fastest and win the prize. The business world is like a big game, and the companies are the players. One of the most successful companies at that time was Apple. You probably know Apple, right? They make the iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks that many people use today. But in 1997, Apple was not yet as big as it is today. So, they were not the number one company. Now, let's find out who was the second-best company in August 1997. To know that, we need to look at a list called the 'stock market.' This list tells us how well companies are doing by looking at how much their special papers, called 'stocks,' are worth. The more the stocks are worth, the better the company is doing in the game! So, in August 1997, the company that was second best in the market was called Microsoft. Yes, that's the company that makes Windows, which is what many computers use to work. Microsoft was like the 'runner-up' in the game, almost winning the race. Microsoft is a very important company even today, helping many people use computers, play games, and do work-related stuff. In August 1997, they were second-best, but they kept working hard, and they are still a significant player in the big game of business. I hope you enjoyed knowing about the company that was second best in the market in August 1997.

Anyone taking a ride in a time machine back to the London of 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne would find a dramatically different country to the UK's modern capital. The OPTIONS: - Agatha Christie's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - CNN's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - London's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - Queen Elizabeth II's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - St. Martin's Theatre's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - The Mousetrap's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - UK's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work.","output":"London of the 1950s was a time of post-war frugality, contrasts, and change. Fast forward to today, and the city has come a long way in terms of progress, technology, and economic development. One aspect of this transformation can be seen in the wages of the people. The UK's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. The rise in salaries and improved working conditions is just one example of how the quality of life in London has changed since Queen Elizabeth II's ascension to the throne. In the 1950s, London was still recovering from the devastation of World War II. Many families were living in inadequate housing, rationing was still a reality for some goods, and the economic downturn continued to impact the job market. In comparison, the modern city has grown into a prosperous metropolis, recognized as one of the world's leading financial and cultural centers. The introduction of the minimum wage has had a significant impact on the lives of workers in the UK. Established in 1998, the minimum wage has provided a basic level of income for those working in low-paying jobs, ensuring that they can meet their daily living expenses. This has contributed to a reduction in income inequality and has helped to lift many people out of poverty. Technological advancements have also played a significant role in transforming London since the 1950s. The prominence of communication technology, such as mobile phones and the internet, has made staying connected with friends, family, and professional contacts easier and more efficient. This widespread use of technology has enhanced productivity, entertainment, and learning opportunities throughout the city and beyond. The evolution of healthcare in London is another area that has seen considerable progress. While the National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948, the quality and range of healthcare services have expanded significantly since the 1950s. The UK now enjoys one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world, with a heavy focus on preventative measures and improved access to healthcare for all citizens. Overall, London has transformed substantially since Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne in 1952. The city has emerged from the challenges of post-war recovery to become a thriving global capital, with advancements in wages, technology, healthcare, and more. Comparing the city's past to its present reveals a remarkable journey of progress, demonstrating the resilience and innovation of its people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of 'bodymind,' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term \\"bodymind\\", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.  Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114-119) a view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication.  Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) - the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior - is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. \\"It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback).\\" (Oxford 1988: 116) Does the book detail any other important topics?","output":"Yes, the book also talks about something called \\"Concepts of Determinism.\\" It includes things that all people have in common, no matter where they're from or what time they live in. These things can help us understand how people think and behave. The book also talks about the idea of \\"threshold,\\" which is helpful for researchers who study how and why people do certain things, including how they act in relationships. This way of thinking helps make studying people's behaviors more organized and easier to understand."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Salustios Emesalainen Translate this to English?","output":"Salustios Emesalainen appears to be a name, and since names typically don't have direct translations, some context is needed to provide a detailed and long answer. However, we can analyze the two components of this name: 1. Salustios: This might be a variation of the name \\"Salustius,\\" which is a Latin name. It is derived from the Roman cognomen \\"Sallustius\\". Sallustius is a name often associated with the Roman historian and politician Gaius Sallustius Crispus, known simply as Sallust. He was known for his works on the history of Rome, primarily focused on the fall of the Roman Republic. In English, the name would still be rendered as \\"Salustios\\" or \\"Sallustius\\", maintaining its Latin origin. 2. Emesalainen: This part of the name appears to have Finnish roots. \\"Emesalainen\\" could be a last name derived from the word \\"Emesa\\" and the Finnish suffix \\"-lainen\\", which usually denotes an association with a place, in this case, Emesa. Therefore, Emesalainen might mean \\"person from Emesa.\\" It's worth mentioning that Emesa was an ancient city in the Roman province of Syria; this city is now known as Homs in modern-day Syria. So, Salustios Emesalainen could be assumed to be a name referring to a person with Latin and Finnish connections, possibly meaning \\"Salustios from Emesa.\\" Like any name, the meaning can vary depending on cultural and historical context, but this analysis provides an approximate understanding of the name in English."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Understanding the English sentence: \\"A man has been taken away and the alert has now been lifted.\\" This sentence implies a situation where a person has been removed or apprehended, and a previously existing state of alert has been resolved or removed.  2. Understanding the Hindi sentence: \\"उन्होंने इसे पास रखा जब हमने उन्हें पहले रन पर अतीत में ला दिया, वे बस वैसे ही करते रहे जैसे वे करते हैं और अंत में हमें निष्पक्ष और चौकोर मारते हैं।\\". This sentence doesn't seem to correspond to the English sentence, it seems to be discussing something related to a sporting event, potentially cricket (as suggested by the word 'run').  3. Comparing the English and Hindi sentences: Given the meaning of the English sentence and the Hindi one, they do not match. The English sentence discusses a situation where a man has been removed and an alert has been lifted whereas the Hindi sentence talks about a sports event. 4. Determining the label: Since the English sentence and the Hindi sentence are not translations of each other, the label generated is 'No'.  Therefore, comparing the two sentences, it is clear that the 'Hindi' sentence is not a translation of the 'English' sentence and thus the generated label would be 'No'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1]  Now, I have a new situation: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.  Answer this question please: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly? The answer to this question is:","output":"Iceland will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador. This is due to the fact that higher latitudes, such as those closer to the poles, are expected to experience more pronounced and rapid climate change impacts. As stated in your background information, climate change effects are felt more quickly and drastically in higher latitudes, which is where Iceland is situated. The Arctic region, in particular, is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average. This is known as Arctic amplification, caused by factors such as the decreasing ice cover, which reduces the Earth's ability to reflect sunlight back into space, and the increasing exposure of darker ocean and land surfaces, which absorb more sunlight and contribute to further warming. As a result, countries in higher latitudes like Iceland bear the brunt of the changing climate, experiencing melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and disruption of ecosystems. In contrast, Ecuador is located near the Equator and, although not immune to climate change impacts, it might experience them at a relatively slower rate compared to Iceland. However, it is important to note that each country will face different climate change-related problems: while Iceland might see a significant loss of ice cover and rising sea levels, Ecuador could experience changes in precipitation patterns, increased risk of droughts, and threats to biodiversity. In conclusion, Iceland, being situated at a higher latitude, will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador, which is located near the Equator. Each country will face distinct challenges related to climate change, and both will need to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies to address these issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even seen-everything New Yorkers may do a double-take this week, however, when they encounter street teams with hot dog carts stocked with vibrators.      On Wednesday and Thursday, Trojan Vibrations, a line of sexual enhancement devices, will hand out 10,000 free vibrators from two hot dog carts identified as pleasure carts. Along with the brand’s logo, the carts will feature sayings like “Getcha vibes here!” and “Relish the moment.”      Trojan plans to distribute 5,000 each of the Tri-Phoria device, which retails for 40, and the Pulse, which retails for 30, for a total retail value of 350,000. It goes without saying, surely, but Trojan asserts this is the biggest handout of vibrators ever.      The promotion begins Wednesday morning with a live commercial by Howard Stern on his show on Sirius XM Radio. The carts will roam Manhattan for two days, with their locations updated on the Trojan Vibrations Facebook page.      In what Bruce Weiss, vice president for marketing at Trojan, called “almost like a gateway product,” Trojan introduced a vibrating ring in 2005 that was included in some packages of condoms for an “improved condom experience.”      The brand began selling a small vibrator, the Mini, in 2009, and the larger Tri-Phoria in 2010. The strategy throughout for Trojan, a Church & Dwight brand, has been to challenge the stigmas associated with the products.      The company has advertised aggressively, even during prime time on some cable networks. In 2011, Trojan spent 10.5 million advertising its Vibrations line, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.      Today, the Trojan devices are carried in retailers that were not on the radar for sex-toy shoppers a decade ago, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid.      So new are the devices to mainstream retailers that growth in that channel has been phenomenal. In the 52 weeks that ended July 8, revenue for sexual enhancement devices sold in drugstores and mass retailers grew 23.2 percent over the year before, to 16.1 million, according to the Symphony IRI Group, whose totals do not include Walmart. Trojan, which accounts for 66.2 percent of the category at such retailers, grew even more over the year, by 40.2 percent.      According to studies financed by Trojan and published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 52.5 percent of women and 44.8 percent of men have used vibrators. Contrary to perceptions that they are used nearly exclusively by the unaccompanied, 40.9 percent of women and 40.5 percent of men report having used them with sexual partners.      “What we’re doing is taking something like a hot dog cart that is so everyday and so mainstream,” Mr. Weiss said, “and we’re showing people that vibrators are mainstream.”      Two commercials for the newest Trojan Vibrations product, Twister, which retails for 60, promote it as a spark for couples. One begins with a woman on the telephone with a friend.      “All I did was mention it might be a Trojan Twister night and things totally changed,” she says, as her husband passes by first with a load of folded laundry, and then with an iron and ironing board.      “Come on, lazybones, shoe sale today,” he says at one point. Later, he pats the couch beside him with one hand, the remote in the other. “Big game?” he says. “Heck no, let’s watch ‘Desperate Bride Makeovers.’ ”      The campaign is by Colangelo Synergy Marketing in Darien, Conn., part of the Omnicom Group.      Carol Queen, curator of the Antique Vibrator Museum and a staff sexologist for Good Vibrations, a sexual products retailer founded in 1977, credits the new Trojan ads with “pretty seamlessly integrating men into the campaign.”      As both a sales strategy and to more accurately reflect how the devices are used, “a company needs to overcome this notion that vibrators are problematic for couples because men don’t like women to use them,” Ms. Queen said.      Rather than seeing the growing availability of the devices at mass retailers as a threat to specialty retailers like Good Vibrations, Ms. Queen said, “what’s fabulous about the way that Trojan has entered the marketplace is that a rising tide lifts all boats.”      Some consumers who buy their first device as an impulse buy at a mass retailer are apt to eventually be drawn to boutiques like Good Vibrations, which along with Trojan devices has a wide selection of other brands — and knowledgeable staff members.      “Going to a sexuality store like Good Vibrations or many others, you have trained people who can answer your questions and help you choose,” Ms. Queen said. “What most customers are probably not doing is getting the greeter at Walmart to come with them to the vibrator aisle and asking them, ‘Which one should I get?’ ”      Claire Cavanah, co-owner of Babeland, a sexual products shop with locations in Seattle and New York, lauded the plan by Trojan to distribute free devices.      “It sounds fantastic and I’m just delighted that there is a company that has the resources and the sex-positivity to do it,” Ms. Cavanah said.      At the annual BlogHer conference that began Aug. 2, Trojan Vibrations gave out 4,000 devices, meaning that the brand is on pace to give away more than 14,000 of the products in August, with a total retail value of 540,000. Mr. Weiss, of Trojan, said the brand gave out a few hundred of the devices from trucks around New York last summer, and wanted to have more impact this year.      “People were clamoring for the vibrators, and we thought that by giving out more vibrators, it would have more buzz, so to speak,” Mr. Weiss said. ||||| PRINCETON, N.J., Aug. 7, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- August just got a whole lot hotter as the makers of Trojan™ Vibrations bring pleasure to the streets with a massive giveaway of 10,000 Trojan™ vibrators – the largest-ever vibrator giveaway of its kind.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Earlier this week, I wrapped up   a 5-day trip in San Francisco. I woke up a few hours before sunrise, drove through the darkness and out of the city, hiked for 30 minutes to the top of a hill overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and snapped  this photo. As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson. When I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \\"Just take photos as you do other things.\\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \\"I'd like to do some street photography,\\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing. My mistake was that I assumed that because I wanted to take photos, I would end up getting a desirable result. How often do you do this in your own life? We go to the gym to \\"work out\\" without trying to become better at something specific. We wish that we were more creative, but never work on a particular project. When you commit to a task, however, then the next step is obvious. You want to take a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunrise? Next step: find a good spot. You've found a good spot?

Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, later called simply Rehab with Dr. Drew, is a reality television show that aired on the cable network VH1 in which many of the episodes chronicle a group of well-known people as they are treated for alcohol and drug addiction by Dr. Drew Pinsky and his staff at the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California. The first five seasons of the series, on which Pinsky also serves as executive producer, cast celebrities struggling with addiction, with the first season premiering on January 10, 2008, and the fifth airing in 2011. The sixth season, which filmed in early 2012, featured non-celebrities as treatment subjects, and the series name shortened to Rehab with Dr. Drew. Season 6 premiered on September 16, 2012. Sierra, Binzer, and Carey agreed to enter a transitional sober living home in the season finale. All three, as well as Laurer and Foxworth, would eventually relapse; some re-entered treatment. VH1 aired a reunion special detailing the patients' lives since filming. Although Conaway was able to maintain sobriety from alcohol and cocaine, he continued to abuse analgesics for his back pain, and would re-enter treatment in the show's second season. Binzer also appeared in several episodes of the second season for his relapses, as well as the Sober House spin-off series. Laurer was hospitalized in December 2008 and was reportedly going back to rehab. She later was found dead in her house on April 20, 2016.  Nielsen and Rodriguez have reportedly maintained their sobriety. Pinsky has said on numerous occasions that Nielsen has quit drinking and also gave up smoking. Nielsen has also appeared on his radio shows to talk about her sobriety. In 2009, she appeared as a panel speaker to another group at the Pasadena Recovery Center, in which she anticipated the upcoming two-year mark of her sobriety that July, as seen in a third-season episode of the series, which aired in February 2010. Sierra has tested \\"clean and sober\\" for a year and a half following a court-ordered year of treatment at the Pasadena Recovery Center, She also appeared with Nielsen in the aforementioned third-season episode, marking her 18 months of sobriety.  The status of Baldwin's sobriety is unknown. As of May 2009, Foxworth is reportedly sober and gave birth to a son. Carey relapsed and returned to porn, starring in and directing a parody film called Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw, a decision which Pinsky said saddened him. Regarding her sobriety, Pinsky commented in a January 2010 TV Guide story, \\"She puts together, like, six weeks at a time of sobriety, then drifts away. We're trying to get her to stay with it once and for all.\\" What happened to the people who releasped","output":"Many of the individuals who relapsed after appearing on \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\\" faced various challenges and consequences. Here is a summary of what happened to some of them: 1. Jessica Sierra - After relapsing, she entered a court-ordered year of treatment at the Pasadena Recovery Center. She eventually tested \\"clean and sober\\" for a year and a half. 2. Jeff Conaway - Despite maintaining sobriety from alcohol and cocaine, he continued abusing analgesics for back pain and re-entered treatment in the show's second season. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2011 from pneumonia and encephalopathy, which were related to his long-term drug use. 3. Seth Binzer - He appeared in several episodes of the second season for his relapses and the Sober House spin-off series. However, his current sobriety status is unclear. 4. Jaimee Foxworth - As of May 2009, she was reportedly sober and gave birth to a son. 5. Mary Carey - She relapsed and returned to the adult film industry, starring in and directing a parody film called \\"Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw.\\" Her sobriety has been inconsistent, with periods of six weeks of sobriety followed by drifting away from treatment. 6. Joanie Laurer (Chyna) - She was hospitalized in December 2008 and reportedly went back to rehab. Tragically, she was found dead in her house on April 20, 2016, due to an overdose of prescription drugs and alcohol. 7. Daniel Baldwin - The status of his sobriety is unknown. It is important to note that addiction recovery is a challenging and ongoing process for many individuals. Relapse is not uncommon, and it can be a part of the journey for those seeking to maintain long-term sobriety. Support from friends, family, and healthcare professionals may play a crucial role in assisting these individuals with their recovery efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Puerto Rico is designated in its constitution as the \\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\". The Constitution of Puerto Rico which became effective in 1952 adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as \\"Free Associated State\\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic. The island is under the jurisdiction of the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which has led to doubts about the finality of the Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico. In addition, all people born in Puerto Rico become citizens of the U.S. at birth (under provisions of the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917), but citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for president nor for full members of either house of Congress. Statehood would grant island residents full voting rights at the Federal level. The Puerto Rico Democracy Act (H.R. 2499) was approved on April 29, 2010, by the United States House of Representatives 223–169, but was not approved by the Senate before the end of the 111th Congress.

Each question seeks different information about PAN cards. 1. \\"What is PAN CARD for?\\" This question specifically asks for the purpose or use of a PAN card. In response to this question, one would provide a detailed explanation of why PAN cards exist and how they are utilized. For example: A PAN (Permanent Account Number) Card is a unique, 10-character alphanumeric identifier that serves as an important identity proof and is issued to Indian citizens by the Indian Income Tax Department. The primary purpose of a PAN card is to monitor and track financial transactions subject to tax. It simplifies tax compliance for the Indian government by linking every financial transaction to a particular individual or entity, thereby combating tax evasion and encouraging transparency. 2. \\"What is a PAN card?\\" This question is more broad and asks for a general understanding or definition of a PAN card. In response to this question, one would describe what a PAN card is and briefly mention the main functions or roles it plays. For example: A PAN (Permanent Account Number) Card is an identity card issued to Indian citizens by the Indian Income Tax Department. It features a unique, 10-character alphanumeric code that simplifies tax compliance for the Indian government by linking every financial transaction to an individual or entity. PAN cards are used for a variety of financial activities, such as filing tax returns, verifying identity for bank accounts, and conducting certain transactions above a specific threshold.

What is the best way to: To prepare the colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking","output":"Preparing the colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking can be a fun and creative activity. To make the perfect rainbow cookies, it is essential to prepare the dough correctly to achieve the vibrant colors and delicious taste. Here is a step-by-step guide on the best way to prepare colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking: 1. Gather the needed ingredients: - 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour - 1 ½ cups granulated sugar - 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature - 2 large eggs - 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract - 1 teaspoon lemon zest - 2 teaspoons baking powder - ¼ teaspoon salt - Food coloring (gel-based for best results) in a variety of rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) 2. Begin by combining the dry ingredients. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside for later use. 3. Cream the butter and sugar together. In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This should take approximately 3-4 minutes. 4. Gradually add in the wet ingredients. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, into the butter mixture. Make sure to mix well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and lemon zest, mixing until they are well incorporated. 5. Slowly combine the dry and wet mixtures. Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet butter mixture, mixing at a low speed until the dough is combined. 6. Divide the dough evenly into separate bowls. Determine how many colors you want for your rainbow cookies. Divide the dough evenly into the same number of small bowls based on the number of colors you have chosen. For a typical rainbow, you will need seven colors and seven small bowls. 7. Add food coloring to each bowl. Using gel-based food coloring, color each portion of dough with a different color. Start with small amounts of food coloring and mix until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color. 8. Cover and chill the colored dough. Cover each bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour or until the dough is firm enough to handle. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll and shape the cookies. 9. Prepare the cookies for baking. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 10. Shape the colored dough into small balls. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Take one piece from each colored dough and roll them into small, even-sized balls, approximately 1-inch in diameter. 11. Combine the colored dough balls. Gently press and roll the colored balls of dough together to form one large ball, making sure not to mix the colors too much to maintain the rainbow effect. Then, slightly flatten the ball with the palm of your hand. 12. Place the cookies on the baking sheet. Arrange the dough balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet as they will expand during baking. 13. Bake the cookies. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are slightly golden and the cookies are set. Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Now your colored rainbow cookie dough is ready for cooking. Enjoy the vibrant and delicious rainbow cookies with family and friends!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Chris Pleasance. Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford has released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic. He also announced plans to be out the clinic on June 31 so he can launch his reelection campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Ford has been at the Greenestone facility, in Ontario, since checking himself in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera. Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who was filmed last year smoking crack cocaine, has been picture enjoying a swim at his GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario. Ford said today that he plans to be back at home on July 1 when he will launch his reelection campaign (pictured at Toronto town hall in November 2013) Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confesses he has been missing his family. The only time he has seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he adds that he is anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledges that it is his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. 'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.' Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs. 'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.' The picture is the first time Ford has been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing. a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs. On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier. calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it. reminded him of 'football camp'. A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online. In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV. She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room, although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship. Glum: Ford kept his head down as he took the paths at the center last month, which is just north of Toronto. Reflection: He kept his head down as he walked along the path at GreeneStone Clinic in Ontario. He's. is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking,. but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post. Ford previously declared that 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminded him. of 'football camp'. Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the. self-imposed exile. 'It. reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I. went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am. learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Luxury: Ford previously claimed that his rehab was costing 100,000 - and said it was worth every cent. Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says. He. joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There. will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter. He. said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the. morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city. pub. During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000. Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans. He has not said how long he will remain there. Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades. The. same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail. published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the. illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone. On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.' Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.' Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as 100,000. 'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Toronto's former mayor Rob Ford, who was filmed smoking crack cocaine, had checked himself into the GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario after another drunken rant was caught on camera.

Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Ini semua POYO..kari dhal sambal..janji laa..hahaha..kbye..\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the provided review, it seems to contain negative sentiment, with words such as \\"POYO\\" which is colloquial Malaysian slang signifying disapproval or disbelief in something, suggesting that the reviewer is not impressed or satisfied. Given the lack of any positive comments and the overall tone of the review, it would be reasonable to infer that the star rating would be low. However, it is important to note that assigning a precise star-rating based on solely on a written review that doesn't include an explicit rating can be somewhat subjective and varies depending on particular rating guidelines used by different platforms. In general, a ★-rating (the lowest possible) tends to be assigned for experiences that were highly unsatisfactory across the board, with very few if any redeeming qualities. As such, if the reviewer was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, a ★-rating would be plausible. On the other hand, if there were other aspects of the experience that were not mentioned in the review but were nonetheless satisfactory, the actual rating might be somewhat higher. While this answer provides an educated guess based on the information available, the best way to determine the star rating would be for the reviewer to explicitly provide it. Therefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to assume that the reviewer might rate the experience as ★ due to their apparent dissatisfaction, but this should be confirmed by the reviewer themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hint: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.

Taylor had some extra time and decided they would give their mother a ride.  Given the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\", is \\"annoyed by Taylor\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"annoyed by Taylor\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would others feel as a result?\\" when referring to Taylor giving their mother a ride. The given scenario of Taylor offering a ride to their mother is generally seen as a positive and caring action, and not one that would generate a negative emotion such as annoyance.  There could be multiple reactions from others, based on their relationship with Taylor and their current situation or perspective. Some possible responses could include: 1. Appreciative: Family members, friends, and onlookers could potentially feel appreciative of Taylor for their act of kindness. Helping a family member like this demonstrates care and respect, which people are likely to find endearing and heartwarming. 2. Inspired: Others might feel inspired to perform their own acts of kindness or take on a more active role in supporting their loved ones after witnessing Taylor's thoughtful gesture. 3. Grateful: Taylor's mother, in particular, would likely feel grateful for the ride and for having a considerate, helpful child. This expression of love and support could strengthen their bond and improve their relationship. 4. Relieved: If Taylor's mother had been struggling to find a mode of transportation, others who were aware of her predicament may feel relieved that she now has a reliable way to get around. While it is plausible that certain individuals might have a negative reaction, it is important to note that the given scenario is primarily a positive one rooted in goodwill. To offer additional context, one could argue that maybe someone who wanted to give Taylor's mother a ride themselves or who has a contentious relationship with Taylor might feel annoyed, but such a response would not be a direct result of the act of offering a ride itself. In general, Taylor's decision to give their mother a ride would most likely generate positive emotions in others rather than annoyance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease? from the following article ?  Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms. As the third has not bloomed, Glendon is out of luck.

Produced in the UK between 1961 and 1962, what was the first UK Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas????","output":"The first UK Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas, produced between 1961 and 1962, was the ground-breaking show called \\"Supercar.\\" This science fiction television series was a pioneer in the world of children's entertainment at the time, employing innovative techniques that would forever change the course of television production. Gerry Anderson, a British television and film producer, created \\"Supercar\\" together with his then-wife, Sylvia Anderson, for British production company AP Films (later rebranded as Century 21 Productions). The series was part of a genre known as \\"Supermarionation,\\" which was a type of puppetry developed by the Andersons. The unique marionette system incorporated solenoid motors and thin wires, enabling the puppets to have more realistic mouth and facial movements in sync with the pre-recorded dialogue. \\"Supercar\\" was a children's TV series consisting of 39 episodes over two seasons, and it followed the thrilling adventures of test pilot Mike Mercury and his state-of-the-art flying automobile, the Supercar. The Supercar was an impressive invention, capable of flying through the air, taking off vertically, traveling underwater, and possessing a never-before-seen level of technology. Set in the fictional Black Rock Laboratory, the series featured various other characters alongside Mike Mercury. Professor Popkiss was the brilliant inventor of the Supercar, Dr. Beaker was the quirky scientist and co-inventor, Mitch the Monkey served as comic relief, and ten-year-old Jimmy Gibson was a fan-favorite. The Supercar team traversed the globe in their adventures, combating criminals, rescuing people from dangerous situations, and exploring the unknown. The success of \\"Supercar\\" paved the way for many other Gerry Anderson productions, such as \\"Fireball XL5,\\" \\"Stingray,\\" \\"Thunderbirds,\\" \\"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons,\\" \\"Joe 90,\\" and \\"Terrahawks.\\" These series showcased the capabilities of the Supermarionation technique, continually refining and improving the puppetry, storytelling, and special effects. \\"Supercar\\" was a milestone in children's television and an essential building block for the Anderson team. As the first Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas, it introduced the Supermarionation technique to the international market and proved that children's television programs could be intriguing, visually captivating, and innovative. Not only did it inspire other filmmakers and television producers, but it also left a lasting impression on generations of viewers, who continue to cherish the ingenuity and creativity displayed in the series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Find humor in the moment.","output":"Title: Embracing Uncertainty: Strategies for Thriving in a Constantly Changing World Introduction In today's rapidly evolving world, uncertainty has become a constant. New technologies, shifting social norms, and unforeseen challenges make it impossible to predict what the future holds. The ability to adapt, especially during times of uncertainty, is a crucial skill for everyone—in both their personal and professional lives. In this article, we will discuss practical strategies to help you embrace uncertainty and thrive in an ever-changing environment. 1. Admit That You Don't Know Step one in embracing uncertainty is acknowledging that you do not have all the answers. Too often, individuals feel pressured to maintain an illusion of expertise, ultimately hindering their ability to learn and grow. Be open to asking questions and seeking help; admitting you don't know something shows both humility and a willingness to learn. Embracing this mindset promotes personal and professional growth, fostering a foundation of adaptability and resilience. 2. Stay Active Even When Things Are Changing During periods of uncertainty, it can be tempting to simply \\"wait and see\\" how things unfold. However, remaining stagnant can only worsen the situation. Instead, be proactive in facing change head-on by staying active, engaged, and continually learning. This can take the form of pursuing further education, seeking training opportunities, or simply engaging in activities that stretch your comfort zone. Staying active allows you to seize control of your life and make adjustments as needed. 3. Make a Change to Your Surroundings Our physical environment can greatly affect our level of adaptability and resilience. When the world seems unpredictable, introducing small changes to your surroundings can encourage a more adaptable mindset. This may involve rearranging your workspace, picking up a new hobby, or even exploring a different neighborhood. By consciously engaging with change in your daily life, you nurture the ability to cope with larger, more significant changes as they come. 4. Find Humor in the Moment Humor is a powerful tool for navigating uncertainty. When faced with change or new challenges, seeking out and embracing humor can help you cope more effectively. Laughter not only reduces stress hormones but also boosts endorphins, improving mental well-being and strengthening social bonds. Identify situations where humor can be applied without offending anyone or compromising professionalism. Once you can laugh at the ups and downs life throws your way, you will find it much easier to bend with the winds of change. Conclusion Life is fundamentally unpredictable, and uncertainty is inevitable. By admitting that you don't know everything, remaining active and engaged, modifying your surroundings, and finding humor in challenging situations, you can better cope with and even embrace the perpetual changes we all face. As you apply these strategies and develop the skills necessary to adapt, you'll be well-equipped to thrive and find success in our ever-changing world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.  I am facing a new situation today: John was studying the species in African Savannah. He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species would be less active at night, elands or wild boars?

Here is a goal: how do you empty a plastic pool? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available choices: (A). fold it on one end.. (B). flip it over..","output":"To empty a plastic pool, let's examine the two options and justify each step: (A) Fold it on one end: 1. Folding the pool on one end would require gathering the flexible sides and lifting them upwards, which could be difficult depending on the size and shape of the pool. If there is water in the pool, this step may also be challenging due to the weight of the water. 2. As the pool is lifted, the water will start to pour out from the raised end. However, this might not be efficient in removing all the water, as some can still remain trapped in the lower end. 3. Once the majority of the water has been emptied, you would need to adjust the pool again to get rid of the remaining water. This might require additional time and effort. (B) Flip it over: 1. Flipping the pool over requires less effort than folding, especially if the pool's shape and size allow for easy maneuvering. Depending on the weight of the water inside, this step might still be challenging, but more manageable than folding. 2. Once the pool is flipped, gravity will do the work and push most, if not all, of the water out of the pool. This will allow for a more efficient and fast emptying process. 3. After the water is emptied, some residual water may still be present on the surface of the pool. You can easily wipe it off with a cloth or let it air dry. Considering the steps involved in each method, option (B) flipping the pool over makes more sense to accomplish the goal of emptying the plastic pool. The reasons include the easier maneuvering required to flip rather than fold, the efficiency of removing most of the water using gravity, and less required effort overall."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The water was eroding the area under the deck faster than the porch, because the","output":"deck was constructed with poor drainage planning, causing water to accumulate and stagnate beneath it, which in turn amplified the erosion process. Unlike the porch, which had been built with adequate slope and gutter systems to channel water away from its foundation, the deck lacked essential water management features, thus exacerbating the deterioration of the underlying soil. Moreover, the materials used in the construction of the deck - primarily wood and metal fasteners - were more susceptible to water damage, including rot and rust, as compared to the porch's stronger, more durable construction materials such as concrete or brick. Over time, the constant exposure to moisture accelerated the weakening and eventual failure of the deck's support structures, compounding the damage caused by the eroding soil below. Additionally, the location and landscaping of the two structures played a role in the rate of water-induced erosion. The deck was situated in an area of the property where runoff from the roof, yard, and adjacent hardscape surfaces was more likely to pool and infiltrate the soil beneath it. The porous nature of the soil in that specific area, combined with the lack of proper vegetation or ground cover, facilitated rapid water absorption and soil displacement. Conversely, the porch was built on a more stable and well-draining substrate, and the surrounding landscaping featured strategically planted trees and plants, which helped to mitigate erosion and keep the area under the porch drier. Another factor contributing to the faster erosion under the deck was the differing maintenance practices applied to both structures. The porch, being a more frequently utilized living space, regularly underwent inspections and minor repair work, ensuring its drainage systems remained clear of debris and its structure maintained its integrity. On the other hand, the deck, being less visible and less frequently maintained, gradually succumbed to minor leaks, clogging gutters, and wood decay, all of which contributed to the continuous moisture buildup and soil erosion beneath. Finally, the overall design differences between the porch and the deck played a role in the rate of erosion. The porch's closed, elevated, and well-ventilated structure allowed for better air circulation, faster evaporation of moisture, and less direct contact between its foundation and the wet soil below. In contrast, the open design of the deck created an environment in which air circulation was limited, and the wooden support structures were in direct contact with the moist, eroding soil, further escalating the rate of damage over time. In conclusion, the water eroded the area under the deck faster than the porch due to a combination of factors including poor drainage planning, less durable construction materials, the location and landscaping of the structures, differing maintenance practices, and the overall design of the two structures. Addressing these factors through proper construction, landscaping, and routine maintenance can help to prevent such erosion issues in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Let Sikh Americans serve in the U.S. military By Simran Jeet Singh, G.B. Singh, Published: August 5 at 4:45 pm One year ago today, a white supremacist walked into a Sikh place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and opened fire on the congregation. The largest single act of hate-based violence in recent American history captured the attention of Americans across the country and cast the spotlight on a minority community that has been disproportionately targeted by this type of violence. Sikhs have been in America for over a century now and have contributed to this nation in various ways, from education and medicine to public service and law enforcement. However, Sikh Americans who maintain their turbans and beards are still presumptively barred from serving in the military. There have been rare exceptions to the prohibition but what is needed is widespread change. Changing this discriminatory policy would help cultivate a national military that better represents the richness and diversity of the American experience. Changing this policy would also send a powerful message to those who narrowly define what it means to be American and engage in hate violence against those they perceive to be “the other.” A close look at the reasons used to justify the ban of the Sikh articles of faith demonstrates that these arguments are flawed. One of the more common arguments is that Sikhs are unable to wear helmets and protective masks over their turbans and beards, and therefore, they bring unnecessary risk to themselves and their peers. This claim is outdated and patently untrue – Sikhs have a long tradition of military service and have not had a problem placing helmets over their turbans and uncut hair. Moreover, it has been years since the military developed protective masks that safely protect people with facial hair. This argument may have been relevant in the early twentieth century when the policy was first implemented. At that time gas masks were unable to sufficiently protect soldiers with facial hair. However, this issue has been resolved and no longer justifies excluding Sikh Americans from military service. Some proponents of the ban cite the risk of disunity that would come with modernizing appearance regulations. However, over the past decade, the Army has granted exemptions to three turbaned Sikh Americans, two of whom have been deployed to Afghanistan and demonstrated exceptional service in the battlefield – Major Kamaljit Singh Kalsi and Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan. Last year Major Kalsi received a Bronze Star Medal, the fourth highest combat award in the Armed Forces, for saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. This honor, along with the centuries-long tradition of Sikhs serving in the military, illustrates that the turban and beard do not inhibit soldiers from performing their duties alongside their compatriots. The service of these three Sikh Americans also proves that diversity has a place within the military. Certainly there is value in maintaining a shared uniform and discipline for all soldiers, but accounting for and adapting to religiously mandated articles of faith has only served to strengthen the Armed Forces. The Sikh tradition appreciates the importance of maintaining common identifying features and the notion of uniformity is often invoked to understand the distinctive physical identity of Sikhs across the globe. In practice, Sikh soldiers conform the color and style of their religious articles to military dress codes, and groom and tie their beards in a neat and conservative manner, in full compliance with safety requirements. The service of these three turbaned Sikhs has demonstrated that accounting for religious articles of faith will not undermine esprit de corps in the military. Rather, opening up to diversity will help us focus squarely on whether a soldier can do his or her job. The presumptive ban on religious articles of faith adversely affects Sikh Americans in other ways as well. In addition to its discriminatory nature, this policy also perpetuates the alienation of religious minorities in this country. Until Sikh Americans are allowed to serve in the military, the general public will continue to see them as outsiders and aliens rather than fully integrated participants in American society. Repealing the ban against turbaned Sikhs will go a long way in preventing future hate violence such as school bullying, workplace discrimination, or mass shootings like the one we witnessed a year ago in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Modern society has come to increasingly accept and embrace diversity. Last September, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law AB1964, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, the strongest and most comprehensive equal employment legislation in the country. Among other issues, this act forbids segregation of individuals who wear religious articles, such as facial hair or head coverings. The U.S. Armed Forces should be ahead of these changes rather than behind them. The hate-motivated shooting in Oak Creek did not happen in a vacuum. Our nation maintains a number of problematic policies that unintentionally influence many of our misguided perceptions. The presumptive ban barring Sikhs from the Armed Forces is one of these policies, and it is time for the military to reverse this ban. The image of a military that reflects the full diversity of patriotic and contributing Americans would go a long way in preventing future hate-inspired atrocities like the one we saw last year in Wisconsin. Simran Jeet Singh is a Sikh American, social activist, and scholar completing his PhD in the Department of Religion at Columbia University. G.B. Singh is a veteran of the US Army (Retired Colonel). He served in the Army while maintaining his turban and beard from 1979 to 2007. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the issue of Sikh Americans being largely barred from serving in the U.S. military due to their turban and beard, which are an essential part of their religious identity.

I have a SUUUUPPPPEEEERRR long driveway, so I usually drive my truck to the end to check my mail, and on this particular day, I was out in my yard playing with Roxie, I saw the mailman drive by through my fence, and so we walked back to the house, I grabbed my keys, and off we went. This wasn't too long ago, maybe May, so it's hot, typical North Carolina weather, maybe 92 and some change, so my windows are down, because I drive a 13 year old black truck, so it's hot as hell, and it makes it hard to breathe. The AC works, it just takes time to kick in, and number 5 (my highest AC setting) does not work. As I'm driving down, I'm going maybe 5 miles an hour. I'm petting Roxie with my right hand when I feel her jerk out of my reach and I hear a bush rustle, I look to the passenger side, slam on brakes (because the last thing I want is to hurt my baby) and put the truck in park. Sure enough, my mom and her Chihuahua were out in the front yard, and Roxie, being her playful self jumped out and ran. She scared the absolute shit out of me, so now when I drive with her in the car, the window stays shut or cracked. Lesson learned.

Meredith, feeling very much an outsider during the Christmas holidays with Everett's family, opts to stay at the local inn instead of with the family and asks her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her for support. Everett finds himself attracted to the more outgoing Julie. Meredith desperately tries to fit in, but her strained attempt to play charades and a clumsy effort to engage the family in a dinner table discussion about nature versus nurture and sexual orientation prove to be disastrous and their father, Kelly Stone (Craig T. Nelson), the most understanding of the family, blows up at her. Distraught, Meredith attempts to drive off but crashes the car, and Everett's brother Ben (Luke Wilson) comes to comfort her. The two end up at a local bar where, after several drinks, Meredith begins to enjoy herself. She invites Amy's high school flame and local paramedic, Brad Stevenson (Paul Schneider), to the Stones' for Christmas breakfast. The following morning, when she awakens in Ben's bed, she incorrectly assumes their night of revelry ended with the two having sex together. Christmas proves to be a day of accusations, recriminations, self-discoveries, and attempts to mend fences.

To learn to ride the   a). unicycle is easy.; b). bicycle is easy.;","output":"I would like to learn to ride a bicycle rather than a unicycle. To learn to ride a bicycle is easy. Riding a bicycle offers various benefits, making it an attractive skill to acquire. For instance, cycling is an excellent way to stay fit and healthy since it works multiple muscle groups and improves cardiovascular endurance. Additionally, biking is an environmentally friendly method of transportation, as it contributes to reducing one's carbon footprint. Furthermore, it is also a cost-effective means of travel, with lower maintenance costs compared to motor vehicles. Learning to ride a bicycle is generally easier than learning to ride a unicycle, thanks to its design and the more widespread availability of learning resources. The bicycle's two wheels ensure greater stability, and the handlebars allow better control over balance and direction. Moreover, many people worldwide have experience riding bicycles and can offer valuable advice or guidance for beginners. To begin learning to ride a bicycle, follow these steps: 1. Choose a suitable bike: Ensure that your bicycle is the appropriate size for your height and offers a comfortable seating position. Familiarize yourself with its components, such as the brake levers, gear shifters, seat height adjustment, and tire pressure. 2. Find a flat, quiet area to practice: Locate a spacious area with low foot and vehicle traffic, like a park or an empty parking lot. 3. Prepare to ride: Wear a helmet for safety, and consider using additional protective gear such as knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves. 4. Work on your balance: Start by straddling the bike with both feet flat on the ground. Hold the handlebars firmly while practicing pushing off and lifting your feet onto the pedals without wobbling too much. 5. Begin pedaling: Once you feel comfortable with your balance, push off with one foot and start pedaling slowly. Keep your weight centered over the bike and look straight ahead, not at the ground. 6. Practice steering and turning: As you become more comfortable pedaling, gradually incorporate gentle turns, making sure to lean slightly into the direction you are turning. 7. Learn to brake: Familiarize yourself with the brake levers on your bicycle. Practice gently squeezing the brakes while riding at a manageable speed, ensuring that you maintain control of the bike and come to a smooth stop. 8. Build confidence and skill: Continue practicing your riding skills by increasing the difficulty, such as tackling small inclines or trying out various road or path surfaces. 9. Observe traffic rules: Once you're confident in your abilities, learn the traffic rules and regulations for cyclists in your region before venturing into busier areas or sharing the road with motor vehicles. In comparison, unicycling involves balancing on a single wheel, necessitating more advanced balance and coordination skills. While unicycling can be an exciting and unique challenge, most people find learning to ride a bicycle significantly easier and more practical for daily use. So, learning to ride a bicycle is not only advantageous but also highly accessible and enjoyable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minn. town plans to privatize policing The central Minnesota town of Foley tried having its own police department and contracting with the county sheriff's department for law enforcement. Now, in an effort to save money, the city with a population of 2,600 is making a controversial move few others have done: Starting in January, it plans to employ a private security company to patrol its streets. Foley is believed to be the first town in Minnesota to replace its police force with private guards, according to the Minnesota attorney general's office. Nationwide, other cities have supplemented their traditional police with contracted officers, said John Firman, director of research for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Firman said an entirely private security force is a new approach, and his organization hasn't gotten many calls from communities considering the idea. But as cities across the USA struggle with the economic downturn, more will look at innovative ways of providing public safety, Firman said. \\"For the first time in our history … police are no longer immune from budget cuts,\\" he said. In Minnesota, 59 police departments have been dissolved or combined with other departments since 2000, according to the League of Minnesota Cities. Since it disbanded its police department in 2003, Foley has contracted with the Benton County Sheriff's Office to have three deputies patrol the city, providing coverage for about 17 hours a day. This year, the city paid 24,694 a month for the contract. After cuts in state aid and uncertainty about future funding, the Foley City Council started looking at options to save money on policing. The city decided to contract with General Security Services Corp. to provide 24-hour coverage starting in January for about 16,000 a month. GSSC has been in operation for 65 years, Vice President Jackson Hall said. The company has 3,800 employees securing 244 federal courthouses in 44 states. Bill Leoni, director of northern regions, said the company has had a number of contracts with cities to provide specific services. Foley is the first city that GSSC will provide a \\"full spectrum\\" of services, he said. Leoni said GSSC security officers go through extensive training comparable to police officers. They will carry firearms for their own protection and not to enforce laws, he said. The security officers will provide routine patrols and preventive work, things police don't always have time to do anymore, Leoni said. \\"They will provide a highly visible presence,\\" he said. State and county officials say they have questions about how the security officers will operate and what the impact will be. In an Oct. 25 letter, Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson warned that the city is opening itself up to \\"financial exposure.\\" She cited the potential for lawsuits for false imprisonment as one example. Swanson wrote that private security employees may carry a firearm but can use it only in self-defense. Private guards do not have the authority to make arrests other than citizens' arrests, cannot pursue fleeing suspects, make DWI arrests or even traffic stops. There's also the issue of whether self-incriminating statements or evidence taken from a suspect by a security officer could be used in court, she wrote. The IACP doesn't take a position on different policing models, but it does advise cities to plan ahead and not make rushed decisions, Firman said. What appears to be an immediate cost-saving measure may not save any money in the long run, he said. \\"What's driving it is the money, but what we're concerned about is the money doesn't hide the principal issues, which are officer safety and public safety,\\" Firman said. Minnesota Sheriff's Association Executive Director James Franklin said the move raises basic questions on who pays for public safety. Because sheriff's departments are responsible for law enforcement throughout a county, Foley residents will have the benefit of deputies who will respond to emergencies and investigate crimes. Since cities use more police services than rural residents, it's a question of who should be paying for those services, Franklin said. \\"Are the rest of the taxpayers subsidizing the city of Foley?\\" Franklin said. \\"That's for the taxpayers to decide.\\" Petrie and Marohn report for the St. Cloud (Minn.)

Title: The Jewel of the Nile Movie plot: This sequel to 1984's rip-snorting romantic-adventure, Romancing the Stone, is a moderately entertaining tale that pales by comparison to its predecessor. Romance novelist Kathleen Turner and retired soldier-of-fortune Michael Douglas return as a now-complacent couple. Bored with life on a yacht, they find excitement thrust upon them when she accepts a speaking engagement in the Middle East. Once there, she is abducted and finds herself involved with the \\"jewel\\" everyone is chasing. Douglas teams up once more with Danny DeVito to rescue his love. Less charming and more predictable than the original, this suffers for one simple reason: the characters have nowhere to go. In the original story we watched Turner blossom from timid storyteller to lusty adventuress. In this flick she is too much like all the other action adventure babes we've seen before. --Rochelle O'Gorman A:","output":"Douglas teams up with Danny DeVito to rescue his love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Some years ago on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boy decided to go for a swim in the lake behind his house. He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator   was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war   between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them. Luckily, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were seriously scarred by the terrible attack of the animal. And on his arms, were deep scars where his mother's fingernails dug into his arms in her effort to pull the son she loved. The newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted the legs. And then, he said to the reporter, \\"Look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mum wouldn't let go.\\" Question: From the passage we can infer    _  .

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  There is a lot of rain or a dam breaks - Water levels of a river or lake get higher - Water builds up on the ground - Water covers streets - Water gets deep in some places - Water goes into houses and other buildings - The rain stops or the dam is repaired - Water flows into streams Answer:","output":"The final step in the process would be \\"Water flows into streams\\".  Justification:  1. First, there's excessive rain or a dam breaks, causing a surge of water.  2. As a result, the water levels of a river or lake rise. 3. With nowhere else to go, water builds up on the ground. 4. Further, the water starts covering streets, indicating that flooding has started. 5. As the situation worsens, water deepens in some places. 6. Then, water enters into houses and other buildings, causing significant damage. 7. Thereafter, the rain stops or the dam is repaired. This suggests a stop in the surge of new water into the flooded area. 8. Finally, the existing water begins to recede and flows into streams, which indicates the beginning of the end of the flood situation.  Therefore, the last step given is \\"Water flows into streams\\", which depicts the starting of the recovery process after the flood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"Asian man in suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway.\\" if \\"The Asian man is on the train for business\\"?","output":"It is possible to conclude that \\"an Asian man in a suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway\\" if \\"the Asian man is on the train for business,\\" although a few assumptions might still need to be made. Here, I will provide a detailed explanation of how this conclusion could be reached, and the factors that could possibly affect this deduction. First, let's break down the information provided: 1. The man is Asian: This information establishes the ethnicity of the individual in question. 2. The man is in a suit and glasses: This detail might suggest that the person is dressed for a professional setting or business environment. 3. The man is taking a nap: This piece of information indicates that the individual is tired or perhaps trying to utilize some spare time to rest. 4. The location is by the doors in a subway: This statement provides context of where the scene is taking place – in a public transportation system, specifically near the doors of a subway train. 5. The man is on the train for business: This additional piece of information gives us a possible purpose behind the individual's use of public transportation – for business-related reasons. Now that we have the information, we can attempt to connect the dots and make some educated assumptions in order to reach the conclusion that \\"an Asian man in a suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway.\\" The man's attire (suit and glasses) may lead us to believe that he is professionally employed or engaged in business activities. Furthermore, since it was explicitly mentioned that the man is on the train for business, we can safely assume that he is using the subway for commuting to or from work or another business-related destination. Considering that the man is taking a nap, it might be inferred that he could be tired from a long day at work, or perhaps he is attempting to catch up on some sleep during his daily commute. This could be due to a busy professional lifestyle, or it might just be that the man is taking advantage of a moment of downtime in his day. Finally, taking into account that the man is resting by the doors, it's plausible that he found this spot to be the most suitable or convenient for a brief moment of rest. This location could provide the man with a more comfortable or convenient resting spot compared to other seating options available within the subway train. In light of this analysis, it seems reasonable to draw the conclusion that \\"an Asian man in a suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway\\" if \\"the Asian man is on the train for business.\\" However, it is essential to recognize that this conclusion is based on interpretations and assumptions made from the information provided. There could be other factors or details that were not given, which might alter the conclusion or lead to a different outcome altogether."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - bid - concentrate - winning - count - remember  The rationale to choose \\"remember\\" as the answer is that:","output":"The correct answer is \\"remember.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"remember\\" as the answer is that the children cannot recall the original rules of the card games they play. This inability leads them to create their own rules as they are unable to remember the rules that have already been established.  Here's a brief overview of the other choices and why they don't fit the context: 1. Bid: Bidding is a specific action in some card games, like Bridge or Spades, where players state how many tricks or rounds they think they can win. Since the original statement says the children make their own rules and doesn't mention anything about bidding, this choice is not the answer. 2. Concentrate: Concentrating is the ability to focus attention on a particular task or activity. While concentration might be an issue for some children, it's not directly relevant to the given statement, which is about their inability to follow the original rules. 3. Winning: Winning refers to the act of succeeding or being victorious in a game. This isn't the right answer because the statement doesn't mention anything about the children's ability to win the game or their concern about winning; it's related to their inability to remember the rules. 4. Count: In some card games, counting is a skill that involves keeping track of cards that have been played or estimating the possible value of other players' hands. While this skill is essential in specific games, it's not the reason why the children create their own rules as stated in the question. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"remember\\" because it's the only choice that aligns with the context of the statement: the children are unable to recall the original rules, so they make up their own rules while playing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

Kubichek's men, a notorious gang of hitmen, gun runners, and money launderers, are aware of Flynn's every move. The deeper Flynn delves, the more he realizes the terrifying extent of Kubichek's dark empire. Act 1: Set in a gritty urban cityscape, Flynn is seen working on numerous cases, using his unorthodox methods and extensive network of contacts to crack each one. He is contacted by a mysterious and wealthy client to investigate an encrypted flash drive supposedly containing evidence of corrupt law enforcement officers working for Kubichek. Intrigued and motivated by the opportunity to expose the treacherous corruption within the system, Flynn accepts the case. Act 2: As Flynn investigates, he decrypts the flash drive and discovers not only names of corrupt officers but also incriminating information on Kubichek's illegal operations. Flynn begins to take down individual officers, causing a series of events that attracts Kubichek's attention and ire. To protect his empire, Kubichek targets Flynn by putting a hit on him, as well as using his corrupt officers to frame and discredit the private investigator. Flynn, realizing the grave danger he's in, recruits some of his contacts and allies for help, including an ex-cop with inside knowledge on Kubichek's operations, a gifted hacker, and a former mob enforcer seeking redemption. Act 3: Cornered by Kubichek's men, Flynn and his ragtag team devise an elaborate plan to outwit the criminal mastermind and his henchmen, with the intention to expose Kubichek to the authorities and bring down his empire, while clearing Flynn's name. In a thrilling sequence of events, Flynn and his team use their specific set of skills to trap, deceive, and capture Kubichek's men and delve deeper into the villain's lair. As the plot unfolds and tensions rise, several unexpected betrayals occur within Flynn's team, and Flynn is forced to face Kubichek on his own. Act 4: In an intense, action-packed climax, Flynn confronts Kubichek, leading to a brutal hand-to-hand fight in which Flynn ultimately emerges victorious. Having collected enough evidence and backed by some trustworthy law enforcement officers, Flynn exposes Kubichek's extensive criminal empire and the corrupt officers he employed, putting an end to his reign of terror. The film ends with Flynn's good name restored and the promise of new beginnings on the horizon.

Write a summary based on this article: At almost 11 a.m., it's still fairly quiet at the Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida even during the peak of the college spring break season.      It's raining and the pool deck is mostly empty. The whole hotel seems to be stumbling towards its figurative coffee pot. But the highrise hotel on the beach is about to get a very distinctive wake-up call.      Since 2012, the party-hearty highrise in Panama City Beach has been getting things started at the crack of 11 a.m. during spring break, blasting the song \\"Circle of Life\\" from the soundtrack to Disney's \\"The Lion King,\\" through its loudspeakers on the pool deck.      As the music plays, spring breakers from their balconies in the hotel raise their hands in the air, shouting along with the lyrics and occasionally holding imaginary lion cubs in the air, reenacting the scene from the movie.      The song was released in 1994, making it about as old as your average college spring breaker.      \\"For these kids, this would have been one of their first Disney movies,\\" said the hotel's director of marketing Philip Colvin. \\"We thought it would be kind of neat to play something from their childhood and see how they react to it.      \\"We were overwhelmed by how they reacted to it. We've done all sorts of songs as a wake-up song and none of them had the reaction that this one did.\\"      Colvin said the song has become a huge hit among spring breakers.      \\"It started as just a funny idea to see what would happen,\\" Colvin said. \\"It's kind of a tradition now. Now if we don't do it or talk about not doing it, people get upset with us.\\"      Though the song has been a staple at the Holiday Inn spring break experience since 2012, it's only recently gained widespread notoriety.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why is it surprising that Maisy still has the coat on ?","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant evidence in the passage In the passage, it is mentioned that Maisy received a new coat, and she put it on and said, \\"raaah I'm a coat monster\\" and refused to take it off. Step 2: Determine the context of the situation The passage notes that at the time when Maisy is wearing the coat, it is not very cold. Step 3: Analyze the evidence and context to form a justification Given that it is not very cold, people typically would not wear a coat, especially one designed for colder weather like a duffle coat. The fact that Maisy still has the coat on implies that she likes it so much that she is ignoring the typical conditions under which a coat would be worn. Step 4: Provide a supporting statement for the answer It is surprising that Maisy still has the coat on because it is not very cold, which makes it unnecessary and potentially uncomfortable to wear a coat during such weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Requires too much strength for toddlers Product review: The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen \\"reward\\" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required. A:","output":"The provided review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product, especially if you are intending to purchase the toy for a toddler, for a few reasons. Firstly, the problem of the toy requiring too much strength has been clearly highlighted in the review. Toddlers in general do not have great physical strength, and toys that are difficult to operate can cause more frustration than enjoyment. A key role of toys in a child's early development is promoting fine motor skills improvement, so if a toy is too difficult to manipulate, it may not be suitable for age-appropriate growth and development. In this case, the complaint that the springs on the toy are too tight, making it difficult for babies and toddlers to operate, would be a significant deterrent. Secondly, while the presence of dinosaur characters instead of the usual ones might bring some novelty, this unique aspect is overshadowed by the functionality issue. The primary look and theme of the toy are secondary to the comfort and usability for a toddler. If the child is unable to engage with the toy due to its stiffness, then even the most interesting characters wouldn't enhance the appeal of the toy. Thirdly, the comparison made with other pop-up boxes, which the reviewer mentions are usually designed to \\"reward\\" the child with less strength needed, also decreases the chances of buying the product. This indicates that there are alternative toys on the market that are more suitable for toddlers.  In conclusion, the overall effect of this review would likely discourage potential buyers, specifically those who intend to buy for toddlers, based on the highlighted concerns regarding its operation and the availability of better-suited alternatives in the market."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (nee Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted 29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon \\"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\\" The advice was unanimous. \\"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,\\" House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be \\"a nice conclusion\\" to his career.  Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.  Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford to tell him that \\"smoking gun\\" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, \\"Al Haig asked to come over and see me,\\" Ford later said, \\"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.'\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Who is Ford and why did he become the Vice President?  Ford, or Gerald Ford, was an American politician who became the Vice President of the United States after the previous Vice President, Spiro Agnew, resigned due to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering.

Sentence 1: uh-huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there Sentence 2: Our system could use some work to be more efficient.  Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand why, we must first analyze each sentence separately and identify the main ideas they convey. Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there\\" This sentence acknowledges that the speaker believes the subject being discussed has a \\"great system\\" or an effective process in place. The use of \\"uh-huh\\" conveys a casual agreement or understanding, while the term \\"worked out\\" implies that the system has been carefully developed and implemented. Sentence 2: \\"Our system could use some work to be more efficient.\\" In contrast, this sentence highlights that the main idea is that the speaker's system requires improvement in order to become more efficient. The phrase \\"could use some work\\" indicates that there is room for adjustments and development to ensure optimal functioning. By comparing the two sentences, it becomes evident that they express different points of view on the matter in question. Sentence 1 acknowledges a well-designed and effective system, while Sentence 2 suggests that the current system requires improvements and optimization. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Instead, they present differing perspectives on the efficiency and functionality of the system in question. In essence, the first sentence is a positive perspective with an assumption of efficiency, while the second offers a more critical and realistic viewpoint, admitting the need for enhancements and optimization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the sentence \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\" The question aims to find the number range of currently living bird species across the world. The response to this question accurately gives a numerical range, which is between 9,800 and 10,050 species. This range hints at the fact that there is not a universal agreement on the exact number, thus there’s variation, which in this case addressed as a \\"taxonomic viewpoint\\". It implies that the classification of bird species, which is a scientific endeavor undertaken by taxonomists, can involve some level of disagreement, leading to variations in the exact number of known species. Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and microorganisms of the world. This field uses various investigative procedures that can lead to differing conclusions and subsequently the classification of a species. Therefore, because new species can be discovered, and existing species can be reclassified, the exact number of bird species may vary. For example, what one taxonomist may classify as a single species, another might classify as two different species.  Further, as more research is conducted, and with advances in genetic sequencing, taxonomists may further divide existing species into additional ones, or alternatively, lump what were thought to be separate species together. This is particularly true in areas with high biodiversity where new species are often being discovered. It is also exacerbated by the existence of cryptic species - groups of species which look nearly identical to the naked eye, but are genetically distinct. Moreover, sometimes due to environmental changes, some species might become extinct, which also affects the total count. Conversely, there could also be instances of new species emerging which have not yet been discovered or officially recorded - again affecting the precise number. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.\\" does indeed provide a valid and comprehensive answer to \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\" It reveals the expected uncertainty in the exact count due to several factors, including varying taxonomic interpretations and the dynamic nature of biological species in the face of changing environments."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity.

Q: Passage: The sun set over Framheim on 21 April, not to reappear for four months. Amundsen was mindful of the boredom and loss of morale that had blighted the Belgica expedition's winter in the ice, and although there was no possibility of sledging he ensured that the shore party kept busy. One urgent task was to improve the sledges, which had not worked well during the depot journeys. In addition to those chosen specifically for the expedition, Amundsen had brought along several sledges from Sverdrup's 1898–1902 Fram expedition, which he now thought would be better suited to the task ahead.  Bjaaland reduced the weight of these older sledges by almost a third by planing down the timber, and also constructed three sledges of his own from some spare hickory wood. The adapted sledges were to be used to cross the Barrier, while Bjaaland's new set would be used in the final stages of the journey, across the polar plateau itself.  Johansen prepared the sledging rations (42,000 biscuits, 1,320 tins of pemmican and about 220 pounds (100 kg) of chocolate), while other men worked on improving the boots, cooking equipment, goggles, skis and tents. To combat the dangers of scurvy, twice a day the men ate seal meat that had been collected and frozen in quantities before the onset of winter. The cook, Lindstrøm, supplemented the vitamin C intake with bottled cloudberries and blueberries, and provided wholemeal bread made with fresh yeast, rich in B vitamins.While Amundsen was confident in his men and equipment, he was, Hassel recorded, tormented by thoughts of Scott's motor sledges and the fear that these would carry the British party to success. With this in mind Amundsen planned to begin the polar journey as soon as the sun rose in late August, though Johansen warned that it would be too cold on the Barrier so early in the season.  Amundsen overruled him, and at sunrise on 24 August seven sledges were made ready. Johansen's concerns seemed justified, as harsh conditions for the next two weeks—temperatures as low as −58 °C (−72 °F)—prevented the men from leaving. On 8 September 1911, when the temperature rose to −27 °C (−17 °F), Amundsen decided he could wait no longer, and the party of eight set off; Lindstrøm remained alone at Framheim.

Combine facts and answer this: Which subject for a Sergey Gerasimov film is often compared to Othello in its essential story line? Answer:","output":"Sergey Gerasimov's 1953 film \\"Twelfth Night\\" is often compared to Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" in its essential storyline. Both plays involve themes of love, jealousy, betrayal, and the consequences of misunderstanding.  \\"Twelfth Night\\" is a Soviet adaptation of William Shakespeare's comedy \\"Twelfth Night, or What You Will.\\" The story revolves around the shipwrecked Viola who disguises herself as a man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino. Orsino is in love with the countess Olivia, but she falls for Cesario (Viola in disguise), leading to a complicated love triangle. In the end, Viola reveals her true identity, and the characters find their proper romantic partners. On the other hand, \\"Othello\\" is a tragedy that tells the story of Othello, a Moorish general, who falls in love with and marries Desdemona, a Venetian noblewoman. Iago, Othello's ensign, manipulates Othello into believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful to him, causing Othello to become consumed by jealousy and eventually leading to the tragic downfall of himself and others around him. The comparison between the two can mainly be drawn due to the themes they share. While \\"Twelfth Night\\" is a comedy and \\"Othello\\" is a tragedy, both are rich explorations of human emotions like love, jealousy, and betrayal. The confusion and misunderstandings that arise from the characters' actions, the use of disguises, and the consequences of unchecked emotions are aspects that tie these two Shakespearean works together.

Summarize this article: Kelsey Osborne and her kids, Madyson and Ryker (Photo: Kelsey Osborne)      GOODING - It's a topic that has sparked debate across the nation over the last few years - legalizing marijuana. In Idaho, recreational and medical marijuana is still illegal.      Last month, Kelsey Osborne, a Gooding mother of two, had her children taken from her after she gave her daughter a smoothie with marijuana in it as an attempt to stop her seizures.      A month later, the two children - Madyson and Ryker - are still living with their father and Osborne is still trying to get them back.      \\"I didn't ever think it would come down to this, but it did,\\" Osborne told KTVB. \\"It tore me apart.\\"      She says her 3-year-old daughter has a history of seizures, but one morning early October, it was worse than ever before.      \\"They would stop and come back, stop and come back with the hallucinations and everything else,\\" Osborne said.      At the time of her seizure, Madyson was withdrawing from a medication called Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Osborne says when she couldn't calm her daughter down, she gave Madyson a smoothie with a tablespoon of marijuana-infused butter.      \\"Everything stopped 30 minutes later,\\" said Osborne.      A couple of hours later, Osborne took Madyson to the doctor. That's where she tested positive for marijuana and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare was called. She was charged with misdemeanor injury to a child, and has pleaded not guilty.      \\"To me I felt like it was my last resort,\\" said Osborne, who maintains that she did the right thing. \\"I've seen it for my own eyes with people out of state who have used it and it's helped them or their children.\\"      Tom Shanahan with the Department of Health and Welfare says in any case dealing with marijuana, there is one bottom line.      \\"Marijuana is illegal, period,\\" said Shanahan.      States that border Idaho, including Montana, Oregon, and Washington have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, and in some cases both. But Idaho isn't one of them and Shanahan says the two drugs aren't interchangeable.      \\"Even in states that have legalized it it's not legal to give to children,\\" said Shanahan. \\"The cannabis that is used for children with epilepsy is called cannabidiol oil and it has had THC removed from it.\\"      Without THC, there aren't any psychoactive properties found in the drug.      \\"It can cause brain development issues with a child, so we view that as unsafe or illegal,\\" said Shanahan. \\"We want children to be in a safe place.\\"      Meanwhile Osborne says she will continue trying to get her children back, who are currently with staying with their father.      \\"I'm not going to stop,\\" she said.      While cannabidiol oil (CBD) is still illegal in Idaho, Shanahan says there is a program in Boise through the FDA that uses CBD as an experimental treatment for 34 children with severe epilepsy.      According to Shanahan, there are strict guidelines for those who qualify, one being that the child has to have tried several other treatments that have failed to work.      \\"It's a totally different substance and I think people confuse that,\\" he said.

(KBOI photo)      Kelsey Osborne and the Idaho Mom’s for Marijuana group rallied outside of the Department of Health and Welfare in Boise Thursday afternoon, calling for medical marijuana reform.      \\"Hopefully it'll open everybody's eyes on cannabis,” Osborne said.      The Department of Health and Welfare placed Osborne’s two children – Madyson, 3, and Ryker, 2, with her ex-husband in Jerome, leaving her with only supervised visitation rights.      \\"It tore me apart,” Osborne said, choking back tears. “I didn't ever think that it would come down to this but it did.\\"      It all started in early October when her daughter, Madyson, was suffering from seizures and hallucinations after coming off a prescription anti-psychotic medication.      Osborne said she did what she thought was right as a mother; she made Madyson a smoothie with marijuana butter.      She has since been charged with a misdemeanor count of injury to a child. But says she will continue to protest Child Protection Services until she regains custody.      \\"It's something that I'm going to fight for and I'm not going to give up until I have them back home where they have been begging me to be,\\" Osborne said. \\"I'm not going to stop. I won't stop. If it takes me two years, then it's going to take me two years.\\"      Tom Shanahan, spokesman for the Department of Health and Welfare, responded to the protesters, saying CPS simply follows the laws currently in place. At the end of the day, the department’s main concern is the safety of the children involved.      “Marijuana is illegal. Even in states that have legalized it, it is not legal to use on children,\\" Shanahan said.      In Idaho, medicinal marijuana is only legal for a small group of children with epilepsy. The 34 children enrolled have to go through a series of tests before getting approved, and even then it is a different form of cannabis than that of recreational marijuana, according to Shanahan.      “There’s two different kinds of substances. The one they use for epilepsy doesn’t have THC, it doesn’t appear to have any kind of brain development issues. Recreational marijuana does cause that so it’s not safe for these children.” |||||","output":"A mother in Gooding, Idaho had her two children taken away from her after she gave her three-year-old daughter a smoothie containing marijuana in an attempt to stop her seizures.

What is the answer: James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, declared himself King and was crowned in Chard and in Taunton in 1685 in an attempt to overthrow whom?","output":"James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, declared himself King and was crowned in Chard and in Taunton in 1685 in an attempt to overthrow his uncle, King James II of England and Ireland and VII of Scotland (also referred to as James VII and II). The Duke of Monmouth was the illegitimate son of King Charles II and his mistress, Lucy Walter. Monmouth's rebellion, also known as the Monmouth Rebellion or the West Country Rebellion, was an attempt to capture the English throne following the death of his father, King Charles II, in 1685. King James II ascended to the throne in February 1685 after the death of his older brother, King Charles II. James II was a Roman Catholic, and his ascent to the throne made the Protestant population in England uneasy. The anti-Catholic sentiment in England and Scotland, combined with Monmouth's Protestant faith and his existing support base from his years as a military leader, encouraged him to rise against his uncle James II. Monmouth believed that he had a legitimate claim to the English throne, based on rumors that Charles II and Lucy Walter had secretly married, thus making him a legitimate son and heir. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim, and Charles II never acknowledged Monmouth as a legitimate heir. In June 1685, Monmouth sailed from the Netherlands to England and landed at Lyme Regis in Dorset. He quickly gained the support of local Protestant sympathizers, and he was declared king in different towns of the West Country including Chard and Taunton, in Somerset. A key aspect of the whole affair is that Monmouth's supporters hoped that the Protestant population in other parts of the country would be inspired by his actions and rise up against James II as well. However, this did not transpire the way they had hoped. The rebellion faced numerous obstacles, including a lack of strong leadership, insufficient resources, and the failure to gain the support of a majority of the civilian population. The final battle of the rebellion took place at Sedgemoor on the 6th of July, 1685. Monmouth's forces were defeated by the army led by King James II's commander, Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham, and John Churchill, who later became the Duke of Marlborough. Monmouth was captured a few days after the Battle of Sedgemoor and was taken to the Tower of London. He was subsequently tried for treason and was convicted. On 15 July 1685, he was executed by beheading on Tower Hill. The rebellion's failure led to a series of harsh retributions against those who supported Monmouth, known as the \\"Bloody Assizes\\" presided over by Judge George Jeffreys. The Monmouth Rebellion had significant consequences in the years that followed, as it furthered the religious and political divide in the country. The events also served as a precursor to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was eventually overthrown and replaced by the Protestant King William III of Orange and his wife, Queen Mary II, who were both more favorable to the Protestant population's wishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Why the need for tensor vectors? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPTIONS: I. no II. yes","output":"I. NO Let's begin by distinguishing between the concepts of a vector and a tensor. A vector is an elementary concept in mathematics and physics. It can be viewed as a directional component that has both magnitude and direction. For instance, velocity is a vector because it defines how fast (magnitude) and in what direction you are moving, while temperature, which just tells you how hot or cold it is (magnitude), is not a vector. In a more specific mathematical framework, a vector is an element of a vector space, which is an algebraic structure formed by a set of elements equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. On the other hand, a tensor extends the concept of a vector to additional dimensions. Like vectors, tensors carry information about magnitude and direction, but while vectors act in a single dimension, tensors can accommodate multiple dimensions. To signify this information, tensors use a matrix notation or a multi-dimensional array of numbers. They encapsulate complex geometric transformations and multi-dimensional physical quantities like stress, strain, and the electromagnetic field. More specifically, in the mathematical field, a tensor belongs in a tensor space: an algebraic structure that extends the notion of a vector space to multiple dimensions. Now, on to the second question - why the need for tensor vectors? We resort to using tensors when dealing with multi-dimensional phenomena or complex transformations. For instance, when we have to represent quantities that involve multiple directions at once, like the stress on a material, a vector wouldn't suffice; a tensor would be required here because the change in material is happening along multiple axes and needs a multi-directional representation, which tensors are adept at capturing. The dimensionality of tensors is indeed key, as tensors allow for the representation and manipulation of complex high-dimensional maps in way vectors cannot. Apart from representing multi-dimensional physical entities, they are also used in fields like machine learning and data science for high-dimensional data manipulation. Therefore, these two questions are not paraphrases of one another. The first question asks for the difference between vector and tensor, while the second one seeks to understand the importance or necessity for tensors in the context of vectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",..., what would be the answer ?

It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo.

On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman.

În acest context, decretul la care faceți referire, domnule Președinte, reprezintă o schimbare semnificativă în cadrul dinamic al unei competiții electorale care era deja în desfășurare în momentul adoptării sale. Modificările aduse normelor și reglementărilor care guvernează procesul competițional au implicații directe și imediate asupra grupurilor politice implicate și a electoratului care participă activ la procesul de vot. Permiteți-mi să subliniez câteva aspecte importante referitoare la efectele pe care acest decret le are asupra dinamicii competiției electorale. În primul rând, schimbarea regulilor în acest mod favorizează candidații care au încălcat în trecut legile și reglementările electorale, dar au fost readmise în competiție datorită decretului. Un astfel de tratament preferențial nu numai că poate crea un precedent periculos pentru viitoarele competiții electorale, dar poate provoca și nemulțumire și frustrare în rândul partidelor politice și candidaților care respectă principiile democratice și integritatea procesului electoral. În al doilea rând, decretul poate afecta și percepția publică asupra legitimității alegerilor și a instituțiilor implicate în organizarea și monitorizarea lor. Prin permiterea accesului la putere al candidaților cu istoric de încălcare a legii, s-ar putea ca încrederea populației în corectitudinea procesului electoral să scadă, iar acest lucru ar avea, în cele din urmă, consecințe asupra participării celor care se află în postura de alege.

Plyometrics incorporate jumping movements and strengthen the muscles. This type of exercise also increases the speed and agility you need for most sports. Do these exercises to help get your body used to quick movements and using a lot of power. You need to land lightly while doing plyometrics so that you catch your weight on the balls of your feet. Roll back to your heel, knees slightly bent and hips straight. You will hop over a cone to increase strength and control of your MCL. Practice doing several sets of 20 reps. Stand with a 6 inch cone to the left and hop to the left over the cone landing softly as described in the plyometrics step.  Repeat this with the cone to your right, hopping to the right. Now, jump forward over the cone. Practice jumping backwards over the cone too. Do not snap your knee back to straighten it. Keep your knees stable. You should practice hopping over the cone with one foot, doing 20 reps. This will further increase the power, strength and control you have over your MCL. Hop forward and backward over a 6 inch cone, landing lightly on the balls of your feet and maintaining a slight bend at the knee. Switch feet and practice hopping over the cone with the other leg. Do 20 reps of the scissors jump to increase strength and power. This will help significantly with jumping during sports. Make sure your knees are stable during this exercise, and do not allow your knee to cave in or out.  Use your right leg to lunge forward, keeping your knee directly over your ankle. Push with your right foot so your left leg moves into the lunge position. Sprinting trains your knee, ankle and hip to remain stable during sudden movements. This increases strength and agility. Practice shuttle runs regularly to maintain speed, strength and dynamic stability. Start at a cone and sprint forward to a second cone, a short distance away. Run backwards to the third cone and forward to the fourth. Practice going forward and backwards from cone to cone. Diagonal runs are basically shuttle runs that focus on the outside of each leg and foot. This stabilizes the knee, ankle and hip complex. It also increases agility and makes your MCL stronger.  Run to a cone placed to your left. You will want to pivot off the left foot as you run to the next cone. Pivot off your right foot to the next cone. Maintain proper form and don't allow your knees to bend inward. Always keep your knees slightly bent so they are directly over the ankle joint. A bounding run involves running across 44 yards. You will start at shorter distances and increase your distance over time with practice. This exercise has multiple benefits, increasing flexibility, strength, power and speed. You will want to begin along the sidelines. When you run, push your knees high up toward your chest. As your legs come down, land on the balls of your feet. Your hip needs to be straight and knees slightly bent.","output":"This article outlines plyometric exercises, including various hops, jumps, and runs, to increase strength, agility, and control of the MCL for improved sports performance while emphasizing proper form and stable knee positioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A.

Answer: 55\\" LG OLED TV showcased at CES 2012 Question: what is the organic layer in an amoled screen A:","output":"The organic layer in an AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen refers to a series of thin film layers made of organic molecules that form the crucial light-emitting component within the display technology. To provide a detailed understanding of the organic layer's role and composition, it is essential to delve into the working principles of an AMOLED screen. AMOLED screens consist of various components, including a substrate, anode, cathode, organic layers, and encapsulation layers. The organic layers, in particular, are composed of multiple sub-layers. These include the hole injection layer (HIL), hole transport layer (HTL), emissive layer (EML), electron transport layer (ETL), and electron injection layer (EIL). Each of these layers serves a specific purpose and plays a crucial role in the functioning of the AMOLED screen: 1. Hole Injection Layer (HIL): This layer is crucial for injecting positive charge carriers (holes) into the hole transport layer. It is generally made of materials like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). 2. Hole Transport Layer (HTL): The HTL is responsible for efficiently transporting the holes from the anode to the emissive layer. Common materials used for HTL are organic compounds like N,N'-Di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB) and 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (α-NPD). 3. Emissive Layer (EML): The EML is the most critical component, where the actual light emission process takes place. It contains organic molecules responsible for emitting various colors when supplied with energy. The molecules can either be small-molecule phosphorescent or fluorescent dyes (like Alq3, iridium or platinum complexes) or polymer-based materials (like polyfluorene derivatives) to attain the desired emission spectra. 4. Electron Transport Layer (ETL): This layer ensures the efficient transport of electrons from the cathode to the emissive layer. The ETL materials are typically metal chelate compounds like tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) and bathophenanthroline (Bphen). 5. Electron Injection Layer (EIL): Situated adjacent to the cathode, the EIL's primary function is to inject electrons into the electron transport layer. Common materials used for EILs include lithium fluoride (LiF) and cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3). The organic layers play a vital role in determining the overall performance, color gamut, and efficiency of an AMOLED screen. These materials have been extensively researched and optimized to achieve high-quality, thin, flexible, and energy-efficient displays that are increasingly popular in various consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather - Eventually the long-term climate patterns start to change -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose landscape less susceptible to change such as rocky happens, how will it affect humans burn more fossil fuel.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed involves a landscape that is less susceptible to change, such as a rocky environment. To analyze its effect on the process of climate change due to human activities, we'll consider its direct or indirect impacts. Let's evaluate the steps you mentioned in the process of climate change: 1. Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) 2. Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enters the atmosphere 3. The make-up of the atmosphere changes 4. Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere 5. The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy 6. Human beings cut down trees 7. Human beings do not re-plant the trees 8. Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 9. The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth's short-term weather 10. Eventually, the long-term climate patterns start to change In a rocky landscape, the most significant effect could be observed on steps 6 and 8, where the availability of trees becomes a key factor. A rocky landscape typically has fewer trees, so the capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere decreases. As a result, there may be a more significant accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, it's worth noting that a single rocky landscape will likely have minimal impact on the global climate change process, as it only represents a small fraction of the Earth's total surface area. The direct contribution of this perturbation hypothesis would be quite limited, as it doesn't change the fundamental aspects of human-induced climate change, such as the burning of fossil fuels, emission of greenhouse gases, or modification of the atmosphere. Regarding the indirect effects, human activity in rocky landscapes might not directly influence fossil fuel consumption. However, it could lead to changes in land use patterns. For example, if a rocky landscape is being used for mining activities, it might indirectly contribute to increased fossil fuel extraction and consumption. This would then contribute to climate change by following the same process outlined in the steps 1 through 10. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of a landscape less susceptible to change, like a rocky area, may have some limited direct and indirect effects on the climate change process. Direct effects would mainly pertain to the reduced capacity to absorb CO2 due to fewer trees. Indirect effects could result from changes in land use patterns, such as mining or other activities that contribute to increased fossil fuel consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Three men were involved in a light hearted discussion.\\", does this mean that \\"Three people are arguing over something\\"?","output":"No, \\"Three men were involved in a light-hearted discussion\\" does not necessarily mean that \\"Three people are arguing over something.\\" Although both scenarios involve three individuals conversing or communicating, the tone, intention, and nature of the interactions are quite distinct. In the first phrase, where \\"Three men were involved in a light-hearted discussion,\\" the word \\"light-hearted\\" suggests that the conversation was relaxed, fun, and easygoing. They could have been talking about their favorite movies, sharing funny stories or anecdotes, or discussing any topic that carries positive and enjoyable emotions. The emphasis here is on the convivial atmosphere, where no heated debates or serious disagreements are present. It generally implies that the participants were enjoying each other's company, and the conversation flowed with harmony and good spirits. On the other hand, the phrase \\"Three people are arguing over something\\" suggests that the individuals are engaged in a dispute or disagreement. An argument often involves differing opinions, conflict, or opposition, which create a more tense and possibly hostile atmosphere. There could be raised voices, interruptions, or strong emotions on display as the participants express their viewpoints. This scenario shows that the conversation has escalated from a friendly discussion to a more adversarial or contentious situation.

ABC may lose Australia Network Another signal has emerged that the Abbott government intends to strip the ABC of its international broadcasting service – the Australia Network – in a significant concession to Rupert Murdoch and to conservative commentators critical of public broadcasting. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has been preparing the public ground since opposition for the ABC to lose its Australia Network regional broadcasting service, which it was awarded by the previous Labor government after a bitterly contested process. In January Bishop criticised the quality of the programming on the Australia Network, and argued it was not serving Australia’s regional interests as “a tool of public diplomacy”. The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that the service was likely to be scrapped in the May budget as a savings measure. The commission of audit established by the government will also run the ruler over other ABC services. The Sky News network lost out to the ABC in the Australia Network tender process carried out under the previous Labor government. The multimillion-dollar tender was botched due to sharp divisions within Labor over whether the ABC or Sky should emerge with the regional service. Sky, a broadcaster part owned by BSkyB – a British company controlled by 21st Century Fox, which is a sister company to Murdoch’s Australian publishing arm, News Corp – has made no secret of its fury about that process, and has lobbied the Coalition to have the ABC’s contract dumped. In its aborted media reform package in early 2013, Labor did manage to legislate a provision where only the ABC or its associated companies could provide “commonwealth funded international broadcasting services”. It was a means of trying to lock in the ABC’s position regarding the Australian Network after any change of government. The reform suggests the Coalition would need further legislation if it wanted not to bank the saving, but clear the field for a commercial broadcaster. Whether the ABC would need to be compensated for the dumped contract is unclear. The acting opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, said she did not watch a lot of the Australia Network because she lived in Australia, but believed the channel was providing “a very valuable service” in projecting Australian values to the region. She said the government was \\"proposing to cut almost a quarter of a billion dollars\\" through the axing of the Australia Network contract, despite signalling before the election that it would not reduce funding to the ABC. Asked whether the Australia Network should reflect support for Australia to achieve the aim of soft diplomacy, Plibersek said freedom of speech was a worthy value to promote. “I'm very happy for the world to see that in Australia you can stand up, you can criticise the government, the government can respond and everybody goes home that night safe and sound,” she said. The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said the Australia Network did an \\"outstanding job\\" and it would be \\"a very bad mistake\\" for Abbott to abandon the service. In addition to bruised feelings over the Australia Network process, the Murdoch-owned News Corp is also campaigning to have the ABC pushed out of digital news services. The ABC’s online content is offered free to readers and viewers, and News Corp is one of several publishers arguing the national broadcaster’s ongoing digital expansion threatens their business. News Corp faces further commercial pressure in 2014. The tabloids will face competition in Australia for the first time in many years with the entry of the British-owned Daily Mail – one of the most successful digital news sites in the world. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, launched a strong public criticism of the ABC on Wednesday during a radio appearance on 2GB in Sydney. Abbott took issue with the ABC's reporting of claims by asylum seekers of mistreatment at the hands of the Australian navy. The prime minister suggested the national broadcaster needed to be more patriotic, and should be inclined to give the navy the benefit of the doubt. The ABC has taken steps to check the accuracy of the claims made by the asylum seekers, and an email from an ABC researcher made its way into the public domain indicating that some editorial executives doubted the allegations were accurate. This email has given impetus to the broadcaster’s critics who contend the story should not have been broadcast. A spokeswoman for the national broadcaster said: “In a climate where official information about asylum seeker operations is scarce and hard to come by, the ABC makes no apologies for seeking as much information as it can from as many sources as it can to either verify or disprove the allegations at the centre of the story.” Abbott also reaffirmed his concerns about the ABC's collaboration with Guardian Australia on the story that revealed Australian spy agencies’ past efforts to target the phones of the Indonesian president, his wife and inner circle.

He told Fairfax Media that politicians may have issues with ABC content, but could not tell media outlets what to write. “What's the alternative … the editor-in-chief [of the ABC] becomes the prime minister?” Turnbull said. “Politicians, whether prime ministers or communications ministers, will often be unhappy with the ABC … but you can't tell them what to write.'” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The Australian government might take away the Australia Network from the ABC, which is a way for the ABC to share their shows with other countries, especially nearby ones.

This new format featured a 7-inch diameter record with a large center hole, offering an alternative to the larger 12-inch LP records. The 45 rpm records were designed to be used with a specific player that included a changing mechanism, allowing multiple discs to be stacked and played one after another, similar to the conventional changer handling 78 rpm records. The 45 rpm records provided a shorter playing time per side compared to LPs, with a total playing time of around eight minutes. This meant that longer works, such as symphonies, needed to be released across multiple 45s, rather than a single LP. However, RCA claimed that their new high-speed changer offered such swift side breaks that the interruptions were either inaudible or inconsequential to the listening experience. These early 45 rpm records were made using either vinyl or polystyrene as the material.

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate, January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey) is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensryche) at a local rock festival. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs. Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensryche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensryche in 2012.  The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future. The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song \\"The Lady Wore Black\\", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensryche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensryche's permanent lead singer. Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.  Queensryche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983, with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. EMI re-released the EP, Queensryche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensryche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.  On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensryche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre. Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005-2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensryche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name. It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensryche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.

Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

How soon after my period can I take a pregnancy test? I have irregular cycles. To determine the best time to take a pregnancy test when you have irregular cycles, you need to consider the following steps: Step 1: Understand the role of hCG Pregnancy tests detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which is produced by the developing placenta after implantation occurs. hCG levels typically double every 48 to 72 hours in the early stages of pregnancy. Step 2: Determine your cycle length Since you mentioned that you have irregular cycles, it's essential to observe your cycles for a couple of months to identify your average cycle length. Step 3: Wait at least two weeks after ovulation Ovulation usually occurs halfway through your cycle. However, if your cycles are irregular, this might be hard to pinpoint. Observing fertility signs, such as basal body temperature or cervical mucus, or using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) can help estimate your ovulation date. Waiting at least two weeks after ovulation allows enough time for hCG levels to rise to detectable levels. Step 4: Test on the day of your expected period Take a pregnancy test on the day of your expected period, as this is when hCG levels are typically high enough to be detected by most home pregnancy tests. For irregular cycles, this might vary.  In conclusion, the ideal time to take a pregnancy test when you have irregular cycles is at least two weeks after ovulation or on the day of your expected period. 2. Will a pregnancy test work the day after? If by \\"the day after,\\" you mean the day after your period ends, it's unlikely that a pregnancy test would provide accurate results. This is because hCG levels are usually not high enough to be detected by most home pregnancy tests so soon after your period. It's essential to wait at least two weeks after ovulation or until the day of your expected period to ensure more reliable results. 3.

Q: Paragraph: Dutch scientist Mark Post displays samples of in-vitro meat, or cultured meat grown in a laboratory, at the University of Maastricht November 9, 2011. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “Cultured meat” — burgers or sausages grown in laboratory Petri dishes rather than made from slaughtered livestock — could be the answer that feeds the world, saves the environment and spares the lives of millions of animals, they say. Granted, it may take a while to catch on. And it won’t be cheap. The first lab-grown hamburger will cost around 250,000 euros (345,000) to produce, according to Mark Post, a vascular biologist at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, who hopes to unveil such a delicacy soon. Experts say the meat’s potential for saving animals’ lives, land, water, energy and the planet itself could be enormous. “The first one will be a proof of concept, just to show it’s possible,” Post told Reuters in a telephone interview from his Maastricht lab. “I believe I can do this in the coming year.”   It may sound and look like some kind of imitation, but in-vitro or cultured meat is a real animal flesh product, just one that has never been part of a complete, living animal — quite different from imitation meat or meat substitutes aimed at vegetarians and made from vegetable proteins like soy. Using stem cells harvested from leftover animal material from slaughterhouses, Post nurtures them with a feed concocted of sugars, amino acids, lipids, minerals and all other nutrients they need to grow in the right way. So far he has produced whitish pale muscle-like strips, each of them around 2.5 cm (1 inch) long, less than a centimeter wide and so thin as to be almost see-through. Pack enough of these together — probably around 3,000 of them in layers — throw in a few strips of lab-grown fat, and you have the world’s first “cultured meat” burger, he says. “This first one will be grown in an academic lab, by highly trained academic staff,” he said. “It’s hand-made and it’s time and labor-intensive, that’s why it’s so expensive to produce.”   Not to mention a little unappetizing. Since Post’s in-vitro meat contains no blood, it lacks color. At the moment, it looks a bit like the flesh of scallops, he says. Like all muscle, these lab-grown strips also need to be exercised so they can grow and strengthen rather than waste away. To do this Post exploits the muscles’ natural tendency to contract and stretches them between Velcro tabs in the Petri dish to provide resistance and help them build up strength. Supporters of the idea of man-made meat, such as Stellan Welin, a bioethicist at Linkoping University in Sweden, say this is no less appealing than mass-producing livestock in factory farms where growth hormones and antibiotics are commonly used to boost yields and profits. And conventional meat production is also notoriously inefficient. For every 15 grams of edible meat, you need to feed the animals on around 100 grams of vegetable protein, an increasingly unsustainable equation. All this means finding new ways of producing meat is essential if we are to feed the enormous and ever-growing demand for it across the world, Welin told Reuters in an interview. “Of course you could do it by being vegetarian or eating less meat,” he said. “But the trends don’t seem to be going that way. With cultured meat we can be more conservative — people can still eat meat, but without causing so much damage.”   According to the World Health Organization, annual meat production is projected to increase from 218 million tonnes in 1997-1999 to 376 million tonnes by 2030, and demand from a growing world population is seen rising further beyond that. “Current livestock meat production is just not sustainable,” says Post. “Not from an ecological point of view, and neither from a volume point of view. Right now we are using more than 50 percent of all our agricultural land for livestock. “It’s simple maths. We have to come up with alternatives.”   According to a 2006 report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, industrialized agriculture contributes on a “massive scale” to climate change, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation and biodiversity decline. The report, entitled Livestock’s Long Shadow, said the meat industry contributes about 18 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and this proportion is expected to grow as consumers in fast-developing countries like China and India eat more meat. Hanna Tuomisto, who conducted a study into the relative environmental impacts of various types of meat, including lamb, pork, beef and cultured meat, said the lab-grown stuff has by far the least impact on the environment. Her analysis, published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal earlier this year, found that growing our favorite meats in-vitro would use 35 to 60 percent less energy, emit 80 to 95 percent less greenhouse gas and use around 98 percent less land than conventionally produced animal meat. “We are not saying that we could, or would necessarily want to, replace conventional meat with its cultured counterpart right now,” Tuomisto, who led the research at Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, said in a telephone interview. But she said cultured meat “could be part of the solution to feeding the world’s growing population and at the same time cutting emissions and saving both energy and water.”   While experts in the field agree that within several years, it may be possible to produce in-vitro meat in a processed form — like sausages or chicken nuggets — producing more animal-like products such as pork chops or steaks could be a lot more complex and may take many more years to develop. Post, who is financed by an anonymous private funder keen to see the Dutch scientist succeed, hopes to hand the world its first man-made hamburger by August or September next year, but for the moment he admits what he has grown is a long way from a mouth-watering meal. He hasn’t yet sampled his own creation, but reviews from others are not great. A Russian TV reporter who came to his lab tried one of the strips and was unimpressed. “It’s not very tasty yet,” Post said. “That’s not a trivial thing and it needs to be worked on.”   But with the right amounts and right types of fat, perhaps a little lab-grown blood to give it color and iron, Post is confident he can make his Petri dish meat look and taste as good as the real thing. He also hopes the ability to tweak and change things will mean scientists will ultimately be able to make meat healthier — with less saturated and more polyunsaturated fat, for example, or more nutrients. “The idea is that since we are now producing it in the lab, we can play with all these variables and we can eventually hopefully turn it in a way that produces healthier meat,” he said. “Whereas in a cow or a pig, you have very limited variables to play with.”   (1 = 0.727 Euros) Claim: Petri dish to dinner plate, in-vitro meat coming soon.

Answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What happened to the narrator after the article?

Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from  Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \\"irrefutable evidence\\" that \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \\"three-note motif\\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \\"This Game We Play\\" was submitted to MGM.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Animal.","output":"What roles do animal vocalizations play in communication and survival? Animal vocalizations serve a variety of purposes and are essential for their communication and survival. These vocalizations can be heard in a wide range of species, from birds and mammals to reptiles, amphibians, and insects. In each species, these sounds play a crucial role in various aspects of their life, such as mating, bonding, warning others about potential threats, and marking territory. Here is a detailed overview of the roles animal vocalizations play in communication and survival. 1. Mating and reproductive purposes: Many species use vocalizations to attract a mate and indicate they are available for breeding. For example, male birds often sing elaborate and distinctive songs to advertise their availability to females and show off their fitness. Frogs and toads also make specific calls during mating seasons to locate and choose their partners. These vocalizations can convey information about the caller's age, size, and health, allowing potential mates to select the most suitable partner for successful reproduction. 2. Social bonding: Vocalizations play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining social bonds between conspecifics (members of the same species). Some bird species engage in duets or group singing to reinforce their social bonds, such as when family members join together in a chorus. In mammals, the mother, offspring, and other group members may stay in contact through vocalizations, such as a baby elephant's trumpeting or a chimpanzee's call. These sounds help maintain social structure and group cohesion, contributing to the overall well-being and survival of the species. 3. Territory defense and resource guarding: Many animals use vocalizations to signal their presence and ownership of a specific territory. By vocalizing, they can deter rivals from entering and help prevent potential conflicts. For example, a male songbird may sing to proclaim its territory and prevent other males from entering. Similarly, wolves and other canid species use howls to warn off conspecifics from claiming their hunting grounds or den sites. 4. Alarm calls and predator avoidance: One of the most crucial functions of animal vocalizations is the ability to communicate potential threats to other members of their group. These alarm calls serve as a warning system, helping animals protect themselves and their group members from predators or other dangers. For instance, vervet monkeys have specific calls for different predator types, such as eagles, snakes, and big cats, allowing them to appropriately react to the threat at hand. 5. Foraging and food search: Vocalizations can also aid animals in finding food. For example, certain species of bats use echolocation, emitting a series of high-frequency sounds that bounce off objects in their environment. By listening to the returning echoes, bats can locate and track their prey with precision, which is essential for catching insect prey during flight. 6. Navigation and orientation: Animal vocalizations can sometimes act as auditory landmarks to navigate and stay oriented in their environment. This is especially crucial for nocturnal species when visual cues are limited. A notable example is nocturnal birds, like the nightingale, which depend on their song patterns to position, time their activities, and orient themselves in their habitat. In conclusion, animal vocalizations serve as a fundamental aspect of communication and survival for a range of species. These sounds contribute to the success of mating, social bonding, territory defense, predator avoidance, foraging, and navigation. As a result, vocalizations have evolved into complex and intricate signals, allowing animals to effectively respond to their environment's challenges and thrive within their ecological niches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who is \\"he\\" in this prior sentence?","output":"The pronoun \\"he\\" in the sentence \\"Gary envied Bill because he was rich\\" refers to Bill. This interpretation is based on how English grammar typically works.  In English, the pronoun \\"he\\" is used to refer back to a previously mentioned noun, which in many cases is the noun nearest to the pronoun. This is known as the principle of proximity. Here, the nearest noun to \\"he\\" is \\"Bill,\\" so it would be logical to assume that \\"he\\" refers to \\"Bill.\\" Moreover, the context also supports this interpretation. The sentence describes a cause-and-effect relationship. Gary envied Bill because of something - in this case, because \\"he\\" was rich. It is more logical to assume that Gary envied Bill because of something related to Bill himself. So, When we say \\"he was rich,\\" we are most likely talking about Bill being rich.  If \\"he\\" were intended to refer to Gary, the sentence would mean Gary was rich and he envied Bill, which doesn't quite make sense because people typically experience envy towards those who posses something they don't have. However, please note that while this interpretation is the most likely, there are some cases in English where this pattern doesn't hold. The intended meaning can also depend on the wider context in which the sentence is used, not visible in this example. Only limited information can reduce the accuracy of conclusions. But based on the information given, \\"he\\" in this sentence most likely refers to Bill."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sleeping in a loft bed was not a good idea for Samantha but it was for Elena because","output":"Sleeping in a loft bed was not a good idea for Samantha but it was for Elena because their varying degrees of discomfort with heights affected their abilities to adapt and feel at ease in their particular sleeping arrangements. Samantha, who had always been uncomfortable with heights, found it exceedingly difficult to adjust to her new loft bed. Her heart would race every time she climbed up and down the ladder to her sleeping area, and her anxiety kept her from having a restful night's sleep. The loft bed, which was supposed to provide extra space and efficiency in her room, soon became a constant source of unease for her, ultimately defeating its intended purpose. Moreover, Samantha's fear of heights intensified when she was trying to go to sleep. The bed's elevation caused her to feel exposed, vulnerable, and at risk of falling even though the loft bed was equipped with safety rails. This psychological insecurity prevented Samantha from embracing the benefits of her new sleeping arrangement. Consequently, her overall well-being and daily functioning were negatively impacted due to her sleep deprivation caused by her fear-induced insomnia. On the other hand, Elena did not share the same level of discomfort with heights that her friend Samantha did. Despite a slight unease when it came to elevated spaces, Elena was more adaptable and willing to face her fears in order to enjoy the advantages that a loft bed provides. Not only did she find the additional space beneath the bed to be a marvelous bonus for extra storage or a cozy workspace, but Elena also came to appreciate the loft bed as a unique and fun feature in her room. Over time, Elena's mild discomfort with heights began to subside as she grew more accustomed to her loft bed. She found that climbing up and down the ladder actually provided her with a sense of adventure and an opportunity to confront her mild phobia head-on. Consequently, Elena was able to overcome her fears and embrace her sleeping arrangement, enjoying restful nights of sleep and a room layout that was both functional and appealing. In conclusion, while Samantha's significant discomfort with heights caused her to have persistent anxiety that interfered with her ability to sleep soundly and appreciate the benefits of a loft bed, Elena's milder unease allowed her to adjust and ultimately derive enjoyment from her unique sleeping arrangement. These contrasting experiences demonstrate the importance of considering individual preferences and fears when selecting furniture that is intended to fulfill both practical and personal needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To make a large living room more livable and less intimidating, create two or more distinct sections. Backless or low-backed sofas, especially L-shaped ones, are excellent for dividing a room without blocking line of sight or creating odd, tall distractions in the center of the space.  Dividing a large rectangular space into two squares often improves its appearance, as square spaces are almost always more appealing to the eye. You can use one or more sections for other purposes as though they weren't part of your living room, although the overall color scheme should match. An extra large ottoman is better than a coffee table for making a large space between couches or chairs feel cozy. A small couch will feel out of place in a large room, so replace a larger one or buy a second matching one and angle them slightly toward each other to form one side of your furniture arrangement. If all your paintings or wall hangings are small, place them in groups to make a large, pleasing arrangement that fills visual space. Tapestries tend to be larger and cheaper than paintings. An indoor potted plant you're willing to care for can add color and visual interest where there used to be empty space. Decorative figurines, sculptures, or ceramics draw attention to a smaller scale. Don't clutter the table so much it becomes unusable, however; one to four pieces on each one is sufficient. If you're interested in a complete redesign, using rich colors, wainscoting, or multiple colors to make the space less bare. Drawing attention to the walls makes your guests feel encompassed by the space in an intimate environment. Summary:","output":"To make a large living room more inviting, create distinct sections using low-backed sofas, opt for large ottomans over coffee tables, and utilize larger artwork or indoor plants to fill visual space."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - melts - wet clothes - move mountains - thin blood - take several forms The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Take several forms\\" Water can undergo phase transitions at various temperatures, resulting in it taking different forms. These forms can be classified mainly into three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor or steam).  At low temperatures below 0°C (32°F), water turns into ice, which is its solid state. Conversely, when water is heated above 100°C (212°F), it converts into steam or water vapor, which is its gaseous state. Water's liquid state is the form in which we're most accustomed to seeing water and occurs across a range of temperatures from the melting point of ice up to the boiling point of water.

There are a few assumptions made in the conclusion and additional information that could be explicitly stated. In order to make a more accurate conclusion, one would need further context and details about the situation. Firstly, one must assume that the children in Africa are indeed part of a group. The original statement does not explicitly mention that the children are together in a group. It is possible that they are individually clapping in separate locations or dispersed among others. Therefore, one must only infer that the children are indeed a group. Secondly, the conclusion states that the children are not only clapping but also observing. This information is not provided in the original statement. The children may be clapping for various reasons, including excitement, appreciation, or encouragement. It might be appropriate to associate clapping with observing an event or performance, but the original statement does not explicitly mention this. One must consider that the children could be clapping as part of a game, song, or cultural activity unrelated to observation. Lastly, the term \\"African children\\" implies that the children are of African descent, not just located in Africa. It is important to acknowledge that the continent of Africa is home to diverse populations, including immigrants, and has a rich tapestry of cultural differences. The children might not necessarily be of African descent, even though they are in Africa at the time of clapping. The original statement does not provide sufficient information to conclude their specific ethnic or cultural background. In summary, while it is possible to conclude that \\"A group of African children observing and clapping\\" based on the information \\"Children in Africa clapping,\\" there are several assumptions made and additional details that need to be explicitly stated for a more accurate interpretation.

Answer:","output":"The information provided is likely about the professional rugby league player named Dean Parata. This conclusion can be reached due to the fact that the source given specifically refers to him on the rugbyleagueproject.org website. Born on October 4, 1991, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, Parata evidently embarked on his professional career in Italy in the year 2013. As an athlete who plays rugby, his physique is also mentioned. He weighs 80 kg and stands at 180 cm tall, which is standard for many professional players in this physically demanding sport. Furthermore, the term \\"hk\\" as position refers to the hooker role in rugby, indicating that Parata is a hooker – a key role typically responsible for dictating play between forwards and backs during the game. This is also in line with the information known about Parata's professional playing career. In terms of his performance, he evidently did not score any tries, field goals, or points during the period represented by these statistics, which could be either a specific season or over his entire career. This is reflected by the values being set at 0 for \\"triesa\\", \\"fieldgoalsa\\", \\"goalsa\\", and \\"pointsa\\". Additionally, \\"appearancesa\\", represents the number of games that Parata took part in, which is noted as being 3 according to the provided data. Furthermore, the keyword \\"new\\" is stated as \\"yes\\", but without context, it's hard to decipher what exactly this refers to. It might mean that he has newly joined a team, or that the data set provided is recent at the time it was recorded. Nonetheless, without further information, this remains unclear.

BEIJING, China (Reuters)  -- A panda once believed to be male and sent to Japan to breed with a female without success gave birth to twin cubs this week, state media reported on Thursday. An estimated 1,600 wild pandas live in nature reserves in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The panda, \\"Jinzhu\\", gave birth to two female cubs on Monday at the Wolong Nature Reserve in the mountainous southwestern province of Sichuan, 11 years after being declared male at birth in 1996, Xinhua news agency said. \\"Jinzhu was believed to be male owing to her inconspicuous secondary sex characteristic and behavior,\\" the agency quoted Wei Rongping, assistant director of the reserve's research center, as saying. Jinzhu was sent to Japan in 2000 to mate with a female, the report said. \\"When the pandas showed complete disinterest, experts decided to turn to artificial insemination, leading to the discovery that Jinzhu had no penis,\\" it added. Jinzhu was sent back to China in 2002, with experts arguing the panda was either a hermaphrodite or had \\"undeveloped\\" sexual organs. \\"The penis of an adult panda is only about 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) long,\\" Xinhua quoted Li Deshen, a panda expert, as saying, as a possible reason for the mix-up. It was not until 2005 that scientists discovered nine-year-old Jinzhu's ovaries were positioned in the wrong place, and gave her a two-hour operation to make her a \\"normal girl\\", Xinhua said. Jinzhu subsequently mated with a male in March 2007 and gave birth 142 days later, Xinhua said. The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species and is found only in China.

The Nacho's Game\\" Nacho, a young, passionate but overlooked soccer player living in a small town in Mexico, suddenly emerges as the hero at the local town soccer match. Despite his talent, he'd always been disregarded by the local team because of his humble background. He works at his father's small churro stand and often practices with a homemade soccer ball after work hours. A pivotal match between Nacho's town and their long-standing rivals is scheduled to happen. The town team's star player is injured, and by a twist of fate, Nacho is chosen to replace him. Everyone in the town, including Nacho himself, is full of doubts about him playing in the star player's place. Yet, seeing no other option, Nacho decides to give it his all and starts training rigorously. The day of the match finally arrives, palpable tension is in the air as Nacho steps onto the field. The game unfolds, and the rivals are tough. However, Nacho’s raw passion for the game, his street-smart tactics learned from his humble but rigorous practices, start to turn the tide. The last few seconds of the game, score tied, Nacho in a surprise play ricochets the ball off a rival player into the goal, securing the victory for his town. The crowd erupts in cheers, and just like that, Nacho is no longer the overlooked churro boy but the town’s soccer hero.

Forest fires burn forests. 2. The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide. 3. Predators can now find their prey easier. 4. Birds will fly away from the area. 5. Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. Perturbation: Suppose more prey happens. Question: How will an increase in prey affect the predation rate (more preying) and the second effect mentioned (fewer hiding places for animals)? Let's perform a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: An increase in prey can be attributed to factors such as reproduction or migration. As the prey population increases, predators might have an easier time finding food. Step 2: The second effect mentioned - the animals having fewer places to hide - has already occurred due to the forest fires. If there are more prey in the area, it could further lead to the concentration of the remaining animals. Step 3: With more prey available and a higher concentration of animals, predators will likely have even easier access to their food sources. Given this analysis, the increase in prey would result in \\"more\\" predation. The perturbation influences the second effect mentioned (animals having fewer places to hide) by increasing the concentration of animals in the remaining hiding spots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \\"circuit\\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \\"regional convention\\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.

Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to prison sentences.

After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellant, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City (Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Catwoman).

Here is a premise: Nothing could more aptly epitomize the Mutiny's good and bad results, from an Indian point of view, than the name given to the legislation that was to  the 1858 Act for Better Government of India. Here is a hypothesis: The Better Government did, ultimately, make India a better place to live. Here are the options: OPT: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, it is important to first analyze both the premise and hypothesis in detail and then consider the available options.  The premise asserts that the 1858 Act for the Better Government of India epitomizes both the good and bad results of the Mutiny from an Indian point of view. As a historical background, the Indian Mutiny, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a result of several political, social, and economic grievances, culminating in widespread uprisings against the British colonial authority. In response to the Mutiny, the British government enacted the 1858 Act, which abolished the British East India Company's rule and established direct governance under the British Crown. The hypothesis posits that the Better Government did eventually make India a better place to live. This statement assumes that the 1858 Act ultimately led to an improvement in living conditions, marked by greater prosperity, welfare, and social harmony in India. Given the available options (yes, it is not possible to tell, no), we will now examine whether the premise compels the truth of the hypothesis: Option (i) - Yes: If we are to accept this option, we must find strong supporting evidence that the 1858 Act directly led to an improvement in living conditions in India. While there were some positive developments under the colonial government, they were often accompanied by exploitation, economic stagnation, and a lack of focus on the welfare of the Indian population. Therefore, it is difficult to unequivocally assert that the Better Government made India a better place to live. Option (ii) - It is not possible to tell: This option stresses the ambiguity of the relationship between the 1858 Act and the improvement in living conditions in India. The complex consequences of colonial governance and the numerous intervening factors make it challenging to definitively conclude that the Better Government resulted in a better India. This option acknowledges the inherent limitations of grasping the full implications of a historical event. Option (iii) - No: This option would be appropriate if there is evidence that contradicts the hypothesis. While there were negative aspects of colonial rule, such as economic exploitation and racism, this option would only be suitable if the 1858 Act had exclusively or predominantly led to adverse outcomes. Based on the above analysis, it appears that the most appropriate answer is option (ii) - it is not possible to tell. The premise does not conclusively support the hypothesis due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the relationship between the 1858 Act and the improvement of living conditions in India. The outcomes of the Better Government are a combination of both positive and negative impacts, and as a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rodents can squeeze through small gaps and cracks, so make sure to seal up any openings you find. Common entry points include gaps around doors, windows, and vents. Step 2: Seal up any gaps and cracks Use materials like steel wool, caulk, or spray foam to seal any gaps or cracks you find during the inspection. Make sure to also check less visible areas like basement and attic. Step 3: Maintain cleanliness Regularly clean your home, as a clean and clutter-free environment is less attractive to rodents. Vacuum floors, wipe countertops, and take out the trash to minimize food sources for rodents. Step 4: Properly store food Make sure to store food in sealed containers, and clean up any spilled food immediately. Don't leave pet food out overnight, as it can also attract rodents. Step 5: Eliminate potential rodent habitats Remove debris, woodpiles, and clutter from around your home’s exterior to minimize potential nesting sites. Trim trees and shrubs to prevent rodents from climbing and gaining access to your home. Step 6: Dispose of garbage properly Keep garbage in sturdy, sealed containers and take it out regularly to avoid attracting rodents. Step 7: Install screens on vents and chimneys Installing screens on vents and chimney openings will help prevent rodents from entering your home through these points. Step 8: Set up traps or use rodenticides If you suspect a rodent infestation, set up traps, or use rodenticides according to the product label. Make sure to place them in areas where rodents are likely to travel and keep them out of reach of children and pets. Step 9: Consider professional help If you're struggling to keep rodents away despite taking preventive measures, consider hiring a professional pest control service to help you eliminate the problem.

Regents case and the ruling regarding public universities' admissions and employment practices. In the landmark case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), the United States Supreme Court confronted the issue of affirmative action in higher education. Allan Bakke, a white applicant, sued the Regents of the University of California after being denied admission to the University of California, Davis, Medical School. Bakke argued that the school's admission policy, which reserved 16 of the 100 available seats for minority students, violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court's decision in Bakke was deeply divided. The Court held that the university's use of strict racial quotas in its admission policy was unconstitutional. However, in a separate opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., the Court acknowledged that race could be considered among other factors in a university's admissions process. Powell's opinion clarified that pursuing diversity within the student body was a compelling interest, making it permissible for universities to use race-conscious policies. As a result of the Bakke decision, public universities and other government institutions are not allowed to set specific numerical targets or quotas based on race for admissions or employment. However, they are allowed to implement affirmative action programs that take race into consideration as one of many factors in a holistic review of an applicant's qualifications. Subsequent Supreme Court cases have further refined the parameters within which race-conscious policies and affirmative action programs may be implemented. The Court has emphasized the importance of individualized, holistic review and has required institutions to demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives would not be sufficient for achieving their diversity objectives. In summary, the sentence mentioned provides a valid answer to the question about public universities' limitations by stating that they cannot set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment, as determined by the Supreme Court ruling in Bakke v. Regents. However, public universities are allowed to consider race as one of many factors in a holistic review process, and the pursuit of diversity within the student body remains a compelling interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Game is both infinitely simple and ridiculously complex. Also, you lost again, if you're still reading. The rules to the Game are as follows:  Everyone in the world is playing the Game, whether they know it or not. If you think about the Game, you lose the Game. This includes things like desperately trying not to think about the Game, or being tipped off by anyone else talking about losing the Game, or any split-second that the Game randomly pops into your mind. You think about it, you lose. When you lose, you have to announce that you lost. It can be out loud, on the Internet, in writing, or in any number of other ways. Announcing your losses is the only way that the Game is played. Nobody ever wins the game, you can only avoid losing and attempt to make other people lose by spreading the word about the Game. If you're in the Game to win, you're going to lose. If you're in the Game to lose, congratulations! Ironic processing is the psychological phenomenon that describes the inverse relationship between a desire to avoid thoughts and the persistence of those thoughts. In other words, the more you want to stop thinking about the Game, the more you're thinking about the Game.  This is also sometimes called the \\"white bear phenomenon,\\" based on a reference in Tolstoy, or the \\"pink elephant phenomenon.\\" The act of deciding to not think about something makes you think about something.  Ironic processing was used to humorous effect in the first Ghostbusters movie, in which the Ghostbusters were told that whatever they thought of would come to destroy them. Despite attempts to clear their minds entirely, someone thinks of the Stay-Puff'd marshmallow man, who arrives in monster-form to destroy Manhattan. Some people play the Game slightly differently, giving players a grace period after losing before you can lose again, or are not required to announce it for a certain period of time. This time can range from a few seconds to half an hour or so. Others put restrictions on ways that a loss can be announced. If you're playing with some friends, decide on winnable rules, if you want. Some may say that death can also end the Game, while others say that the Game will end when the British Prime Minister, President of the United States, or the Pope says the Game is lost on national television. Still others believe that the Game can only be won when someone knocks the hat off the Pope. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses \\"the Game,\\" an ongoing, unwinnable mental game played by people worldwide. The rules dictate that when a participant thinks about the Game, they lose and must announce their loss. The more one tries not to think about the Game, the more likely they are to think about it, due to the ironic processing phenomenon. Variations in rules exist, including grace periods and restrictions on loss announcements. Some believe the Game can be won through specific actions, such as a high-ranking official publicly announcing a loss or knocking the hat off the Pope."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Richard Tiffany Gere (; born August 31, 1949) is an American actor and humanitarian activist. He began acting in the 1970s, playing a supporting role in \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" and a starring role in \\"Days of Heaven\\". He came to prominence in 1980 for his role in the film \\"American Gigolo\\", which established him as a leading man and a sex symbol. He went on to star in several hit films, including \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Primal Fear\\", \\"Runaway Bride\\", \\"Arbitrage\\" and \\"Chicago\\", for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and a Screen Actors Guild Award for part of the Best Cast.  - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\").  The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.  - In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term \\"crime\\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\\"a public wrong\\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - An Officer and a Gentleman is a 1982 American romantic drama film starring Richard Gere, Debra Winger and Louis Gossett, Jr., who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film, and was produced by Lorimar Productions for Paramount Pictures. It tells the story of Zack (Gere), a U.S. Navy Aviation Officer Candidate who is beginning his training at Aviation Officer Candidate School. While Zack meets his first true girlfriend during his training, a local young woman named Paula (Winger), he also comes into conflict with the hard-driving Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant (Gossett, Jr.), the drill instructor training his class.  - American Gigolo is a 1980 American crime drama film starring Richard Gere , written and directed by Paul Schrader .

What do all mammals have in common that distinguishes them from birds?","output":"To accurately determine the common characteristics of mammals that distinguish them from birds, I'll go through the following steps: Step 1: Identify mammal characteristics First, I'll list the primary characteristics that define mammals: 1. They are warm-blooded (endothermic) 2. They have a backbone 3. Hair or fur is present at some stage in their life 4. Mammary glands produce milk to nourish young 5. Three middle ear bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) 6. Presence of a diaphragm to assist in breathing 7. Most mammals give birth to live young (except monotremes: platypus and echidna lay eggs) 8. Usually specialized teeth for different types of food Step 2: Identify bird characteristics Next, I'll list the primary characteristics that define birds: 1. They are warm-blooded (endothermic) 2. They have a backbone 3. Feathers cover their body 4. Beaks for feeding instead of teeth 5. Lay eggs with hard shells 6. Lightweight skeleton adapted for flight 7. Presence of two legs and two wings 8. Forelimbs evolved into wings for flight Step 3: Compare and find the unique characteristics of mammals Lastly, I'll compare the listed characteristics side by side and identify unique features of mammals that distinguish them from birds: 1. Presence of hair or fur (mammal) vs. feathers (birds) 2. Mammary glands producing milk to feed their young (unique to mammals) 3. Three middle ear bones (mammal) vs. one ear bone (birds) 4. Majority of mammals give birth to live young (mammal) vs. laying hard-shelled eggs (birds) 5. Specialized teeth (mammals) vs. beaks (birds) 6. Presence of a diaphragm (unique to mammals) Conclusion: The common characteristics that distinguish mammals from birds include the presence of hair or fur, mammary glands producing milk, three middle ear bones, giving birth to live young in most cases, specialized teeth, and the presence of a diaphragm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the past few years, I have made a habit of asking my fellow Africans from different countries what they think would have been the lot of our continent if the slave traders and colonisers had never set foot here. Some suggest that African societies would have eventually evolved, gradually catching up with the rest of the world in terms of development. Others insist that Africa was already at the same level of development as the rest of the world, but that slavery and colonialism interrupted and stunted our growth. Some others believe that we Africans would have wiped ourselves out with tribal wars and conquests and that the continent would have become a vast space with the few surviving ethnic groups spread out far from one another. I like to imagine that we Africans would have eventually, in the fullness of time, sorted ourselves out. We would have discovered electricity and gravity; we would have invented air conditioners and refrigerators and we would have wondered what lay across the vast oceans, then sent men and women in ships to find out. It may have taken many decades, it may have taken centuries, but African societies would have eventually made their way towards what is known as \\"first world\\" status. I also imagine that, at some point, an African would have thought, \\"My hair is tightly curled and beautiful. But I wonder what it might look like when straightened. \\"What if my hair were blue instead of black? What if yellow or red? What if gold?\\" Such an African could then have gone on to invent hair relaxers and dye, despite never having seen a Caucasian with straight, blond hair. It would have been less about \\"trying to look like white people\\" and more about creativity, a quest for options. Africans may also have contemplated the possibility of switching skin colour. \\"Some of us are dark-skinned and beautiful; some are light-skinned and equally beautiful. What if the dark can become light and vice versa?\\" The first set of \\"bleaching creams\\" manufactured may have been carcinogenic. But eventually, an African scientist, unhindered by any guilty feelings around helping \\"black women make themselves look like white people\\", would have perfected a bleaching cream that was not dangerous. He may even have received a much-needed government grant to further his research. African women would then have been free to alter the colour of their skin without any adverse health effects. Many of the Nigerian women I know who use skin-lightening products are not necessarily originally dark-skinned. They are already light-skinned women who want to reinforce what they already have. Think of a butcher sharpening his knife or a Naomi Campbell wearing high heels. Some of these women bleach their skin only a few weeks before a big event, such as a society wedding. They know that there will be a crowd of guests and they intend to stand out. Therefore they purchase the most eye-catching jewellery and clothing, and don the most elaborate pompadours. Being light-skinned is a natural stand-out factor in a society where the majority of people have dark skin. By bleaching their skin, these women also aim to \\"glow in the dark\\". Nigeria's infamous 419 scammers of the 1990s had a reputation for flashy lifestyles. They drove the biggest cars, wore the most flamboyant clothing, and built the most ostentatious houses. Many of them also tended to prefer being seen in the company of light-skinned girlfriends and wives, women whose complexions \\"flashed\\". Females eager to benefit from the scammers' largesse began bleaching their skin. Skin lightening became simply a tool for fetching a wealthy man. Almost every year, a fresh debate erupts in the media around bleached skin and other alterations to appearance that African women embark upon. I suspect that this year will not be different. This topic will once again make the rounds. One of my New Year wishes is that accusations of \\"wanting to be like white people\\" or \\"being ashamed of being black\\" will not drown out whatever else Africans around the world have to say regarding the various choices they make.

The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Jeans do not actually need to be washed as regularly as other clothing items. In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely.  You really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash. If you're up to it, washing jeans by hand can be more gentle on them than machine washing. This should be a standard practice each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry. Turning the jeans inside out will prevent detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye. Jeans washed inside out will maintain more of their color. If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent. You can buy this at most supermarkets or department stores. You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as  replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans.  Detergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye. Vinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea. Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes. If clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans. Jeans require a gentle wash and low temperatures to prevent fading. Set your washer for the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use it. Summary:","output":"To maintain color and prevent fading, wash jeans less frequently, inside out, with color-protectant detergent or vinegar, and use gentle cycles with low-temperature water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: when did world war 2 start in china?","output":"World War 2 is commonly considered to have started in Europe with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939; however, the conflict between China and Japan that eventually consolidated into the broader war began earlier. This Sino-Japanese conflict, which was later assimilated into World War 2, began on July 7, 1937. To understand the origins of this conflict, it is helpful to delve into the historical background of the events leading up to it. In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a region in northeastern China, following the Mukden Incident. The invasion led to the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, controlled by Japan the following year. The League of Nations condemned this aggressive move, prompting Japan to withdraw from the international organization in 1933. Meanwhile, the tensions between Japan and China continued to escalate, with incidents of armed skirmishes occurring frequently along their borders. On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place near Beijing when a minor clash between Chinese and Japanese troops quickly spiraled out of control. This event marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the conflict escalated, the Japanese forces launched a full-scale invasion of China, rapidly occupying key cities, including Shanghai and the capital, Nanjing (then spelled Nanking). The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, occurred in December 1937, when the invading Japanese army murdered, raped, and brutalized tens of thousands of Chinese civilians. During the course of the war, both sides experienced significant casualties. The Chinese endured prolonged Japanese aggression as well as internal strife, as the Communist and Nationalist factions within the country temporarily joined forces to resist the invasion. The war in China was not limited to conventional military confrontations; guerilla warfare, terrorism, and acts of sabotage were commonplace throughout the conflict. The Second Sino-Japanese War merged with World War 2 as Japan increased its level of aggression in the region. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 forced the United States to enter the war, marking the beginning of the Pacific War that eventually led to the downfall of the Japanese Empire. The conflict in China continued until the end of World War 2. The official defeat of Japan came on September 2, 1945, with their formal surrender. The Chinese Civil War between the Communist and Nationalist factions resumed shortly thereafter, ultimately leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party in 1949, and the retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan. In conclusion, the start of World War 2 in China can be traced back to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937, which marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This conflict eventually merged with the broader global war, becoming an integral part of the fight against Axis powers.

Answer the following question: The address I had been given was a flophouse called Casa Salvador in the scummy side of downtown, the part where the city's redevelopment (read: \\"gentrification\\") efforts hadn't yet managed to drive out the sundry undesirable elements. I walked inside past the front lobby. I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top. Her skin was leathery and weather beaten, and I guessed she was the type who was actually a good ten years younger than she looked. I made my way up the narrow staircase that smelled of urine and bleach, going all the way to the third floor. I continued down the dimly lit hallway, past a series of closed doors that muffled the sounds of women faking moans of pleasure. Room 313 was down at the far end of the hall, and its door was already slightly ajar. I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \\"Hello? Is anybody in there?\\" There was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door. My watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily. After a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump. How did he feel when he saw the bat? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Disgusted. - not enough information - Concerned. - Curious.

The equation is: 329 + 489 = -232*d - 177*d When we add 329 and 489, we get: 818 = -232*d - 177*d Now, we need to combine the terms with \\"d\\" in them. To do this, we add -232*d and -177*d together: 818 = -409*d Now, we need to find the value of \\"d\\". To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -409. 818 ÷ -409 = -409*d ÷ -409 So, we get: d = -2 So the solution to the math problem is d = -2.

Understand what fear feels like. Know what happiness feels like. Review what sadness feels like. Know what surprise feels like. Article:","output":"Title: Exploring Our Emotions: A Guide for Little Learners Hey little friends, today we are going to talk about something very interesting and important - emotions! Emotions are the feelings we have inside us. They help us understand how we feel about different things happening around us. Let's learn about some common emotions and what they feel like! 1. Anger Imagine when someone takes away your favorite toy without asking, and you really want to play with it. That feeling inside you that makes your face turn red and your heart beat faster is called anger. It's okay to feel angry sometimes, but remember to always share your feelings with a grown-up and take deep breaths to calm down. 2. Disgust Have you ever been given a plate of food with something on it that you really don't like? Like a super yucky vegetable? That feeling of \\"eww\\" and wanting to push the plate away is disgust. It's your way of saying \\"I don't like that thing!\\" 3. Fear Remember when it's dark and you hear a strange sound, and you think there might be a monster hiding under your bed? That feeling of being scared is called fear. Fear helps to protect us from things that might be dangerous, but sometimes we can feel fear even when there's nothing to worry about. It helps to have a cuddle with someone you love, or even sing a brave song to help chase the fear away. 4. Happiness Happiness is a bright and joyful emotion that we feel when something good happens to us or when we are having lots of fun. It's like when you're playing with your friends, or you get a surprise treat you love. Happiness makes us smile and giggle, and it makes our hearts feel warm and cozy. 5. Sadness Sometimes things happen that make us feel down and upset. Maybe you dropped your ice-cream on the ground, or you have to say goodbye to a friend who's moving away. That feeling you get when you want to cry and your heart feels heavy is called sadness. It's okay to be sad sometimes, just remember to talk to someone about it and give yourself some extra love to help feel better. 6. Surprise Surprise is the feeling you get when something unexpected happens. This can be a good surprise like an exciting birthday party, or a not-so-good surprise, like a loud thunderstorm! Your heart might jump a little, and your eyes might open wide. Surprises can be both fun and scary, but they always keep life interesting! So, there you have it, little learners! Understanding our emotions can help us explain how we feel to others and make better choices about what we do. Remember, it's always important to share your emotions with a grown-up or someone you trust, so they can help too. Now, go out and explore your own emotions and know that it's perfectly normal to feel all these different feelings!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By the 6th century BC, the Celtic La Tène culture was well established. Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the Romans had settlements in the region. In 1800 Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular the Romantics, followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks. In World War II, Adolf Hitler kept a base of operation in the Bavarian Alps throughout the war. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  and the situation: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To prevent moisture rings from appearing on your table,","output":"Preventing moisture rings from appearing on your table involves a combination of proactive measures, proper cleaning techniques, and maintenance routines. In order to effectively protect your table and preserve its appearance, consider the following steps: 1. Use coasters: One of the simplest and most effective ways to prevent moisture rings is by using coasters. Choose coasters made of materials that can absorb moisture, such as cork or fabric, to protect your table from condensation. Ensure that every guest has a coaster and remind them to use it for all drinks. 2. Tablecloths and placemats: Covering your table with a waterproof tablecloth or placemats can protect the surface from spills and moisture, helping to prevent the formation of moisture rings. Ensure that the tablecloth or placemat is easy to clean and maintain. 3. Proper glassware: Sometimes condensation can form on certain types of glassware, such as those with poor insulation qualities. Invest in double-walled glassware or insulated mugs to minimize the chances of condensation forming on the glass and causing moisture rings on your table. 4. Maintain a consistent room temperature: Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause condensation to form on cold surfaces, such as glassware. To minimize this, try to maintain a consistent room temperature so that the surfaces in the room do not experience drastic changes in temperature. 5. Wipe up spills immediately: Accidental spills can lead to moisture rings or other damage. If a spill occurs, clean it up immediately using a soft, absorbent cloth. This can help prevent moisture from seeping into the table surface and causing damage. 6. Use trivets for hot dishes: The heat from hot dishes can cause condensation to form on the table surface, resulting in moisture rings. Use trivets, hot pads, or heat-resistant mats to protect your table from the heat of hot dishes. 7. Regularly clean and maintain your table: To keep your table free from moisture rings and other damage, clean it regularly using a mild soap solution and a soft cloth. Be sure to dry the table thoroughly after cleaning. Additionally, apply furniture polish or wax occasionally to seal the surface and protect it from moisture penetration. 8. Protect your table from humidity: High humidity levels can lead to moisture condensing on surfaces, which can result in the formation of moisture rings. Use a dehumidifier, air conditioner, or ensure proper ventilation in areas where your table is located to keep humidity levels in check. 9. Choose the right table material: Some materials are more susceptible to moisture damage than others. When purchasing a table, opt for materials like solid wood or laminate, which are less prone to moisture damage compared to soft woods, veneers, or particleboard. 10. Repair existing moisture rings: If you already have existing moisture rings on your table, repair them as soon as possible to prevent further damage. You can use a mild abrasive cleaner, such as toothpaste, to gently remove the moisture ring. For more severe cases, consider consulting a professional furniture restorer for advice on the appropriate repair methods. By following these steps, you can effectively prevent moisture rings from appearing on your table, preserving its appearance and ensuring that it remains in good condition for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Mr Ford has denied the video exists, accusing the media of stoking a scandal that has roiled city politics. Journalists from the Toronto Star and US website Gawker say they have seen - but not obtained - a video that appeared to show Mr Ford smoking the drug. In a photograph they say was provided to them by the people who showed them the video, Mr Ford can be seen posing with his arm around Smith. Mr Mohamed was arrested on Wednesday in Alberta and is charged with murder. In April, 23-year-old Nisar Hashimi turned himself in over the killing and also faces a murder charge. The video has not been released publicly and has not been verified. Gawker used a crowd-funding campaign to raise 200,000 (Â£140,000) to buy the video, but the website said it lost contact with the people in possession of the footage.

Given the question: Jennifer stores her bread in the cupboard when she gets home from the grocery store since she thinks it tastes better that way. Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which woman's bread will grow mold slower?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. The answer is:","output":"Martha's bread will grow mold slower because she stores her bread in the freezer. Lower temperatures slow down the chemical reactions involved in mold growth, since the particles of reactants have less energy and move slower, decreasing the likelihood and intensity of collisions. Storing food in a cold environment, like Martha does with her bread in the freezer, reduces the rate at which food spoils, as opposed to storing it in a cupboard like Jennifer does, where the temperature would be higher and mold growth would occur more quickly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers.

Article:","output":"Title: Choosing Eyewear: A Strategic Approach to Enhancing Your Wardrobe Introduction:  Glasses don't just serve a functional purpose – correcting vision. They have evolved into an indispensable fashion accessory that tells a story about your personality, style, and attitude. Just like the nuances of your wardrobe, your eyewear can also reflect your lifestyle, whether you're a professional, a sports enthusiast, a parent, or a fashion aficionado. This article will guide you on how to select glasses that match your wardrobe style and cater to your specific needs.  The Professional Look: Whether in a boardroom meeting or participating in a virtual work conference, your eyewear can enhance your professional image. Those who want to project a more sober and sophisticated image may consider frames in classic shapes (like round or rectangular) and neutral colors such as black, brown, or silver.  Professional doesn't mean boring, however. If your work environment encourages individual expressions of style, you might opt for more daring frames that blend with your professional outfits. For example, blue frames could complement a navy suit, while tortoiseshell frames can give you that quintessential intellectual look, perfect for professionals within academia or creative fields. Try experimenting with shapes and subtle accents, like delicate metalwork or contrasting temples, to add a hint of character to your persona. Eyewear for an Active Lifestyle: For those who live an active lifestyle, choosing eyewear is not just about aesthetics but majorly about comfort and durability. If you regularly participate in sports or outdoor activities, consider sport glasses. They are typically constructed with lightweight, flexible materials like polycarbonate or TR90 nylon that can withstand high impact.  Wrap-around frames are a popular choice for fitness buffs for their snug fit. These glasses often come with features like non-slip nose grips and temple tips that provide much-needed stability during strenuous activities. If you are a swimmer or cyclist, prescription goggles or glasses with interchangeable lenses could be your best bet. Parenthood and Purposeful Eyewear: Parents are always on the go, and they need eyewear that can keep up with them. Durability is key here. Choose glasses with flexible frames that can endure toddler yanks and baby grips.  Frame materials like Titanium or Stainless Steel make a great choice for their strength and longevity. Consider also opting for lenses that are scratch-resistant and have an anti-reflective coating—a small but beneficial feature when you're multi-tasking or up for late-night feedings. Speaking of Fashion: Lastly, but certainly very important, is the fashion angle. For those who consider their eyewear as the ultimate reflection of their fashion sense, the sky's the limit. Merge fashion trends with your personal style by experimenting with frame shapes, colors, patterns, and details. Consider a bold cat-eye or a trendy oversized frame in a bold hue or distinctive pattern for a statement look. Depending on the season, transparent frames, pastel shades, or glasses with floral or tortoise shell patterns might be in vogue.  Conclusion: Everyone's eyeglasses choice will be as unique as their individual lifestyle. It's worth remembering that not every style, material, or design fits everyone, so you should consider not only your wardrobe but also your lifestyle, comfort, and purpose while selecting eyewear.  Remember to have fun during the process. Your eyewear is a reflection of who you are, so excel in that uniqueness. After all, fashion begins where comfort meets individual flair. From functional to fashionable, with the multitude of eyewear options available today, finding the perfect pair of glasses to match your style and lifestyle has never been easier."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a news article: Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Need proof that your job stresses you out? It’s in your Twitter feed.      Workers worldwide wake up happy, then lose that good mood once their jobs begin, according to a two-year review of Twitter posts by 2.4 million people in 84 countries released today in the journal Science.      While scientists have long known that work, sleep and sunshine can affect emotions, the study is among the first to mine social-media for real-time evidence of the connections, said researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The universe of people using social-networking sites such as those run by Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. will almost double to 1.85 billion by 2015, according to research firm IDC, ushering in a new era of Internet-based study of human behavior.      “Twitter almost records everything that happens in life,” said Scott Golder, the lead study author and a graduate student in sociology at Cornell, in an interview. “Mundane, inconsequential, and conversational tweets are a massive archive of digital traces.”      San Francisco-based Twitter, with more than 100 million users worldwide, is a micro-blogging service that lets people post 140-character messages online. The updates are time- stamped, offering a rich trove of data, Golder said.      Today’s study used text-analysis software to track mood fluctuations in the Twitter posts. Messages in the early morning and late evenings were most likely to contain happier words such as “awesome,” “super” and “fantastic,” Golder said. During the workday, missives tended to be peppered with negative language including “panic” and “fear.”      U.S. workers spend an average of 62 minutes each day using social media for personal reasons, compared with 37 minutes for business purposes, according to a survey conducted in July by the Ponemon Institute.      --Editors: Lisa Rapaport, Christian Nicholson      To contact the reporter on this story: Xu Wang in New York at xwang206@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at ||||| It's not just you: That late-day slump is nearly universal, at least in the world of social network users.      Sociologists at Cornell University studied updates from millions of Twitter users, analyzing tweets on an hourly and daily basis. After breakfast, moods from Dubuque to Dubai start going downhill.      \\"We found a very similar pattern in India, Africa, Europe, the UK, Canada, North America, Australia, New Zealand. The patterns are very, very similar even though all those cultures are different,\\" said Michael Macy, a sociology professor at Cornell who, along with sociology graduate student Scott Golder, co-authored an article about the study in the latest issue of Science.      NEWS: Parody Blooms on Twitter      The sociologists analyzed more than half a million public updates from 2.4 million Twitter users in 84 countries over a two-year period. They divided the updates into groups by hour of the day and day of the week. Then they ran them through a program developed by psychologists to measure feelings. It uses a positive and a negative lexicon that each contain hundreds of words like \\"happy,\\" \\"excited,\\" \\"fearful\\" and \\"sad.\\"      \\"People are most upbeat around breakfast time,\\" Macy said. \\"Their mood deteriorates over the course of the day and then rebounds in the evening. Around dinnertime on through the time they go to bed it picks back up again.\\"      At first the sociologists wondered if this was due to work-related stress because overall moods tended to be elevated on weekends. But they noticed that even then, tweets expressed late-day mood dips, even in the United Arab Emirates where weekends are Fridays and Saturdays.      \\"It could be that the elevated mood on the weekends is because they did not get woken up by an alarm clock, which would have disrupted their natural sleep patterns,\\" Macy notes.      He cites strong evidence from previous research how important sleep is as a factor influencing feelings throughout the day.      But how can searching for words in tweets tell the scientists how a person is feeling -- don't they need more context? Macy says it doesn't matter who or what someone is tweeting about. The psychological lexicons, which have been validated, determine general mood based on whether the words Twitter users choose to use are particularly positive or negative.      \\"Social and behavioral scientists have these wonderful opportunities now to study human behavior and human interaction in ways they could not do before,\\" Macy said.      Next, Macy says they are focused on using the enormous Twitter data to study behavior. Golder recently created a public website, Timeu.se , so anyone can do a keyword search on their data and plot the results. One of the sociologists' early findings: \\"happy hour\\" starts around 4 or 5 Monday through Thursday, but on Fridays begins after lunch and keeps going until 10 at night.      NEWS: Can Tiny Tweets Predict Financial Markets?      David Lazer is an associate professor of political science and computer science at Northeastern University. His group has determined countrywide moods based on Twitter updates, but the study didn't look at individuals' daily variations.      \\"The new thing here is that they're clearly finding some sort of signal,\\" Lazer said of the Cornell article. \\"Part of what's beautiful about these data is that they truly offer a picture of the system as opposed to detached observations you might get in a standard survey.\\"      When paired with traditional questionnaires, the Cornell results will give social scientists a better understanding of daily human rhythms, said Thomas Streeter, a sociology professor at the University of Vermont who studies media culture and technology.      \\"Definitely there's a pattern there,\\" he said. \\"But of course they're talking about people who use Twitter. It's not farmers in Zimbabwe.\\"      Social media can be ideal for expressing certain kinds of human expressions but not for others, he added. \\"We have to be careful to not read them as hot lines to our hearts.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A two-year review of Twitter posts by 2.4 million people across 84 countries, conducted by researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, has provided insight into daily mood variations.

Despite - or perhaps because of - a third straight debate performance in which the retired neurosurgeon practically disappeared into the scenery thanks to his low-key public persona, he has continued to climb in the polls. The latest survey, by NBC News, puts him at 29% support, six points up on the former consensus leader, Donald Trump. Mr Carson also has the highest favourability ratings of any candidate, and he's the first or second pick of half the poll respondents - well ahead of all his competitors. By all accounts, then, Mr Carson is on the verge of assuming the mantle of Republican front-runner. While Florida Senator Marco Rubio was the talk of the Washington establishment after his most recent debate performance, the soft-spoken doctor continues to be a campaign juggernaut. But is Mr Carson's lead a mirage? Here are a few possible dark linings that could appear on Mr Carson's silver clouds. Mr Carson has compared gun control, political correctness, the US under Barack Obama and the progressive movement in general to Nazi rule. He's also drawn slavery analogies on the issues of healthcare reform and abortion and said prison sex is evidence that homosexuality is a choice and Muslims should be disqualified from the presidency It's Mr Carson's particular gift that he can deliver lines like these in the calm voice of physician informing his patient that the situation is dire but that a cure is possible, and then allow any resulting wave of controversy to wash over him harmlessly. Although Mr Carson is currently riding high, at some point the cumulative effect of line after inflammatory line could be too much for Republican voter concerned about his prospects in a general election. Or, perhaps, it could put a hard cap on the level of support Mr Carson is able to accrue, creating difficulties for him as the field eventually narrows. Mr Carson's differences with fellow front-runner Donald Trump are more than just ones of style. After earlier criticisms that he was running a campaign without substance, the New York billionaire has released a series of plans - on immigration, tax reform, gun control and veteran's affairs. Other candidates have likewise released their plans, in greater and lesser detail. As for Mr Carson? Not so much. His website features a grab-bag of proposals, lightly sketched, including a call for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, the \\"defeat\\" of federal education bureaucracy, the continued operation of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and healthcare reform based on tax-free personal health savings accounts. He's also called for a flat tax on income that would replace the current progressive tax rate structure and has suggested that the rate be set at 10%, although it could range up to 15% depending on revenue necessities. As a front-runner will Mr Carson be pressed to flush out more policy details? Mr Trump was. So far, however, the retired neurosurgeon has gotten a pass. That, however, might be changing. \\"I want more details and answers,\\" Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, told the Street's Valerie Young. \\"We've seen what uncertainly does to the economy. So if he wants to genuinely have a good performance, he needs to lay it out so people know what to expect.\\" When third quarter fundraising totals were announced last month, Mr Carson made headlines with a 20m - which put him ahead of all Republicans and just behind Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. As the Atlantic's David Graham points out, however, those numbers conceal a less rosy reality. Although Mr Carson is posting big numbers, he's spending a lot to do so. Fifty-four cents of every dollar the neurosurgeon brings in is spent on fundraising - such as developing donor files, printing direct mail literature and paying postage. By contrast, Mr Sanders - who relies heavily on online donations - spends just 4 cents of every dollar on fundraising. Conservative columnist Erick Erickson, notes that Mr Carson spent 69% of the money he took in - his \\"burn rate\\", as it's called - and offers a grim prognosis. \\"Carson's actual expenditure list reads like a wealthy Republican getting played by consultants,\\" he writes. \\"I suspect there are some who see Carson as a cash cow.\\" While that could be great news for political operatives involved, it's not good for a candidate who wants to win elections. Although Mr Carson has shot to the top of several national polls, the Republican race for the presidential nomination is going to be decided on state-by-state battlegrounds, and his polls here so far have been less impressive. Mr Carson has led in several Iowa polls, but the latest puts him in effectively in a tie with Mr Trump. In New Hampshire - less fertile ground for an evangelical-backed conservative like Mr Carson - Mr Trump has posted numerous double-digit leads. The New Yorker has also dominated South Carolina and Florida surveys. None of this is to say that Mr Carson can't turn his national support into a lead in key early-voting states. The reality, however, is that Mr Trump still poses a formidable opponent with loyal supporters who have stuck with him for months now. Will Mr Carson consolidate his gains the same way? Time will tell. During the third Republican debate in Colorado last week, moderator Carlos Quintanilla questioned Mr Carson about his ties to the nutritional supplement company Mannatech, which has paid millions of dollars in fines for deceptive marketing practices. Mr Carson denied having \\"an involvement\\" with the company, saying only that he happily takes the product and was paid to give speeches for them. Quintanilla tried to press the issue but was booed by the debate audience, prompting Mr Carson to smile and conclude, \\"See, they know\\". The questions about Mannatech can't easily be written off as a liberal-media obsession, however. The Jim Geraghty of the conservative National Review has been one of the most dogged investigators into the ties between Mr Carson and the supplement company, and after the debate he said Mr Carson's answers were \\"bald-faced lies\\". \\"Mannatech wanted to improve its image and happily paid Carson, one of the country's greatest neurosurgeons, the man Cuba Gooding Jr played in the [TNT] movie - to appear at their events and to appear in the company videos,\\" he writes. \\"Carson's lack of due diligence before working with the company is forgivable. His blatant lying about it now is much harder to forgive.\\" Mr Carson has pushed back, telling SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily radio show that the National Review has become a \\"political tool\\" of his one of his Republican opponents and that the story was a \\"submarine that's sent by them\\". Whether he's wrong or right about his allegations, chances are the Mannatech story isn't going away anytime soon. Some writers, on the left and on the right, have attempted to draw lines between the aforementioned concerns - the litany of publicity-generating controversial statements, the lack of policy details, the questionable fundraising practices, the ethical questions surrounding ties to Mannatech - to draw larger conclusions about the nature of Mr Carson's presidential quest. Leon Wolf, a diarist for the conservative RedState blog, wonders whether Mr Carson's apparent lack of command of the issues reflects poorly on his commitment to the campaign \\"I am distressed that he has spent apparently no time in study educating himself on the basic issues he would face during the course of the run for his presidency,\\" he writes. \\"I am 100% confident Carson could understand them very easily, which is precisely the reason I'm so bothered that he doesn't. It goes to the seriousness with which he takes the job of running for president, and his personal work ethic at that job.\\" He contrasts Mr Carson with former technology company executive Carly Fiorina, who has spent considerable time honing her command of the issues. \\"I'm at a loss as to what Ben Carson has been doing at all, and I'm disappointed that he apparently doesn't take running for president seriously,\\" he concludes. New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait concludes that Mr Carson says the obvious explanation for Mr Carson's actions is his goal isn't the presidency, it's the accumulation of wealth. \\"Carson is doing a lot of things that seem puzzling for a presidential campaign, but quite logical for a brand-building exercise,\\" he writes. \\"Perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for Armstrong Williams, the figure running the Carson 'campaign', is 'business manager', as opposed to 'campaign manager'. It does suggest that Carson is engaged in a for-profit venture.\\" The nebulousness of Mr Carson's campaign so far leaves him open to these sorts of attacks. How Mr Carson responds - with substance or bluster - will go a long way in revealing whether his candidacy can make it to the finish line. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Retired neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, is on the verge of assuming the mantle of Republican front-runner, with the latest NBC News' survey putting him at 29% support, six points up on Donald Trump. However, his lead may be a mirage. Mr Carson's inflammatory lines may eventually deter Republican voters who are concerned about his prospects in a general election. Unlike Donald Trump, Mr Carson has not set out solid plans on areas such as immigration, and tax reform, but instead suggests lightly sketched proposals. Additionally, although Mr Carson has substantial contributions, he spends a significant amount on fundraising compared to other candidates. In state-by-state battlegrounds, Mr Trump currently poses a formidable opponent, leading Carson in polls for the early-voting states of New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida. Questions surrounding Mr Carson's ties to nutritional supplement company Mannatech and his campaign's nature are additional concerns that might challenge his chances in the Republican race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Memory is essential  for life. We have a short-term memory and a long-term memory. When we get old, our short-term memory becomes weaker, but we can still remember things that happened a long time ago. There are many things we can do to improve our memory, such as using various memorizing methods as well as taking special care of our health. It is important that we regularly stimulate  our brain to make our memory more efficient . For example, we can do activities that we do not usually do and change our daily habits. Learning a new skill helps our brain develop. When trying to memorize something, we should focus our attention on the most important things about it. Do not allow other thoughts to enter our mind because this will lower our chances of remembering things correctly. One basic way of improving our memory is to use the link method. If we want to memorize something, we should make a picture in our mind. If the picture is silly, strange and colourful, we will remember it better. Taking notes, being organized and keeping a diary will also be useful tools. Sometimes, memory is connected with our feelings. When something dramatic happens, we usually remember it well, and we also remember where we were and what we were doing. Healthy food and plenty of vitamins are important to our memory. Drinking a lot of water also helps maintain our memory. When we are asleep, our brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can, therefore, cause problems with storing information. In addition, being tired will stop us from being able to remember well. As a result, keeping fit and having regular health checks are both important as well. Question: When people try to remember the word 'smiles', an easy way to do this is to  imagine there is a 'mile' between the first letter and the last letter.

Question: Question: where did the money for the new scoreboard in milwaukee come from I found the following answer on Google: The team is so named because of the city's association with the brewing industry. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not a correct answer to the question about the funding for the new scoreboard in Milwaukee. The information you found refers to the origin of the name of Milwaukee's Major League Baseball team, the Milwaukee Brewers, which is indeed named due to the city's association with the brewing industry. However, this information does not address the issue of funding for a new scoreboard. To answer the original question, we would need to investigate the specific details surrounding the financing of the new scoreboard. Ideally, you would need to provide more context, such as the name of the specific sports facility or the year the new scoreboard was installed to provide a detailed and accurate answer. In general, financing for scoreboards and other facility upgrades could come from various sources such as: 1. Public funding: This could include funds allocated by the city, county, or state government for facility improvements or infrastructure projects. These funds may be raised through taxes or government bonds. 2. Private financing: Team owners, stadium operators, or private entities may contribute money to fund facility upgrades. Private financing is often provided through loans, personal investments, or in some cases, donations. 3. Sponsorship and advertising deals: Companies and organizations can pay for the naming rights or advertising space on a scoreboard as part of a sponsorship deal. Such deals can be a significant source of revenue and may partially or fully cover the costs of a new scoreboard. 4. Grants: Some organizations or foundations might provide grants for facility improvements or sports-related projects. These grants typically require a detailed application and proposal process, and the recipients may need to demonstrate how the improvements will benefit the sports community or local area. In the case of Milwaukee, it is essential to research the specific details about the new scoreboard to determine the exact funding sources. But it is essential to remember that the city's connection to the brewing industry does not directly relate to the funding of a new scoreboard."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What century does the film take place in?

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"call the police\\" a valid answer? Pick from: - Yes; - No;","output":"Yes, \\"call the police\\" is indeed a valid answer when considering the context of the situation. If others have been informed of a secret concerning a murder that happened last night, it would be a reasonable, responsible, and legal action to contact law enforcement. When someone learns information about a major crime such as murder, the immediate course of action should ideally be to inform the police. It's important to remember that withholding such information could potentially obstruct justice or even put oneself or others in danger. In such cases, every bit of information can be significant and contribute to the successful resolution of the case. As such, the secret that Cameron shared can potentially provide crucial data to the investigation, leading to the capture and conviction of the perpetrators, hence putting an end to any more potential harm that could be caused. In this regard, it's helpful to understand that the person who received this secret from Cameron has been put in a situation of witnessing potentially damning information. This individual has then become a bystander to serious criminal activity. At this point, they have a moral and societal obligation to share this information with the appropriate authorities. However, it's also worth considering the personal safety of this individual. If the information they have is extremely sensitive or exposes them directly to the killers or people related to the crime, contacting law enforcement should still be their next step, but they should also take precautionary measures to ensure their safety. They may seek additional guidance from authorities on this aspect. Therefore, considering all these factors, \\"call the police\\" perfectly reflects what others would want to do next after finding out a secret about a murder. This response is not only valid and expected, but it also serves the common societal good of reporting a crime and contributing to justice being served."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first disc contains the original studio album, the second disc contains B-sides collected from OK Computer singles and live recording sessions, and the DVD contains a collection of music videos and a live television performance.

Given the following passage  \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

Is \\"The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II.\\" a good answer to the question \\"During which times does the value of the dollar typically decline?\\"","output":"The statement you provided, \\"The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II,\\" offers historical context for the original question, \\"During which time does the value of the dollar typically decline?\\" However, the answer can be further expanded and explained to give a more thorough response. The following detailed answer addresses the factors contributing to currency fluctuation and the reasons behind the decline during these war periods while exploring other factors that contribute to the downfall of a currency. The value of a country's currency like the U.S. dollar is influenced by several factors, such as economic growth, interest rates, geopolitical risks, inflation rates, and capital flows. But one notable factor that can drastically affect the value of a national currency is wartime or during significant political unrest and uncertainties. The provided statement highlights that the value of the U.S. dollar has typically declined during wartime, such as the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. To better respond to the question, it's essential to understand why the value of the dollar declines during these periods and discuss other factors that could lead to a depreciation of a currency. During major conflicts like the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II, the United States increased its military expenditures to fund and support its armed forces. To finance these expenses, the government often increases taxes, issues public debt, or prints more money. As money is freshly minted, the sudden increase in the money supply stimulates inflation, causing the purchasing power of the currency to decline and subsequently reducing its value. Furthermore, geopolitical risks and uncertainties degrade investor confidence, causing them to scale back their investments or seek alternative assets, thus impacting the dollar's value in foreign exchange markets. In addition to wartime, other factors contribute to a weakening currency. High inflation rates can drive down the value of a currency since it erodes the purchasing power over time, causing investors to lose confidence in holding the currency. Lower interest rates can lead to a decline in the demand for a national currency, as foreign investors seek better returns in countries with higher interest rates. Economic downturns in the issuing country or a stronger economy in another nation may cause market participants to move their funds out of the weaker currency and into a stronger one, pushing the value down. Moreover, unanticipated events, such as natural disasters or political shifts, negatively impact a nation's economic conditions, ultimately lowering the value of its currency. In summary, the statement provided accurately highlights that the value of the U.S. dollar typically declines during wartime, as seen during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. However, it is essential to elaborate on the factors driving the decline in dollar value during these wars, as well as on other elements contributing to currency depreciation. An adequate answer to the question should encompass these multiple factors, sharing insights into the relationship between inflation, interest rates, economic growth, political uncertainty, and overall market conditions that can lead to currency fluctuation. This broader knowledge will help develop a more comprehensive understanding of what conditions typically cause dollar value decline and result in a more detailed and informative answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We arrived and the hostess was rude and had no idea we were coming. There wasn't anyone there so they set up a table for us. We asked if we could have our checks split and the rude waitress said absolutely not. I have worked in restaurants for many years and if someone is paying for a service and asks ahead of time for split checks I think it is awful to say no way. We will never return there as a group and we do group lunches often at my job. We waited an HOUR (63 minutes to be exact) for our food to hit the table after we ordered. The waitress was terrible- I never got a refill and arte my lunch thirsty. She added 18% grat to our check and made us figure out how to split it. The first time I went there I said I would NEVER return and I gave them one more shot because people claim its amazing and now I am sure I will never go back.

Answer the following question: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types:  Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.  The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying.

In so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the \\"poverty row\\" studio, Majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is STILL well worth watching and provides a few surprises. The story is very, very familiar, as in some Germanic town, the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo. In this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of providing some \\"red herrings\\" (i.e., false leads) and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out Frye may not be responsible, the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror film. In addition, while the production had little money to speak of, it still had some good actors of the day--Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas--and it also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they were done filming for the day). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film. I have seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I have come to notice that her characters have no depth--she always seems to be cast as the \\"screaming lady\\" and provides little new in each film. Overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able. Choose your answer.

If a business,big or small,looked down upon these odds and ends,it would mean a big difference in the amount of the benefit of the business.Take a meat factory for instance,there are countless odds and ends--bones and hair,which can be made into glue and rope to increase its profit greatly.

Options: - bowling alley - hockey game - sporting event - croquet - fridge A:","output":"A bowling alley would be the most appropriate option for enjoying a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects. This setting is most in line with common sense as the scenario described fits the general environment and activity that one would expect at a bowling alley. Firstly, the \\"heavy spheres\\" mentioned in the question are most likely referring to bowling balls which are typically used as the primary equipment in a game of bowling. Bowling balls are designed to be heavy enough to knock down the ten white objects, in this case, the bowling pins. These pins are usually white or have a combination of white and bright colors to make them easily distinguishable from the lanes and background. Next, the act of enjoying a beer is a common occurrence in many social and leisure activities, especially in venues that cater to entertainment and relaxation. Drinking beer is also quite common in bowling alleys, where it can be purchased from the in-house bar or restaurant. These establishments often serve a variety of beverages, including alcoholic drinks like beer, to cater to the diverse tastes and preferences of their patrons. Furthermore, bowling alleys provide the necessary infrastructure and equipment, such as bowling lanes, balls, pins, and automated pinsetters, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for those who want to partake in this recreational activity. Additionally, many bowling alleys combine other forms of entertainment such as arcades, pool tables, or sports viewing areas, which can contribute to a engaging and enjoyable atmosphere. In contrast, the other options presented (a hockey game, sporting event, croquet, or fridge) do not align as closely with the given scenario: - A hockey game and sporting events in general do not involve participants throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects. While people may enjoy a beer while watching the event, these scenarios don't create the optimal environment for this specific activity. - Croquet is a sport played with wooden mallets to hit balls through hoops, and it does not involve throwing heavy spheres or knocking down ten white objects. Likewise, it is typically an outdoor game played in more intimate settings like gardens, parks, or homes and not a common place for consuming beer while playing. - A fridge is an appliance designed to store and preserve food and beverages, so it is not an appropriate venue for any form of recreational activity nor a place to enjoy a beer. In conclusion, a bowling alley is the most suitable location to enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects, based on common sense and the nature of the activity and environment described in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Sham Shui Po District is one of 18 districts of Hong Kong. It is the poorest district in Hong Kong, with a predominantly working-class population of 365,540 and the lowest median household income of all districts. Sham Shui Po has long been home to poorer new immigrants from mainland China. It also saw the birth of public housing projects in the city, as the government sought to resettle those displaced by a devastating fire in its slums. Sham Shui Po also hosted a Vietnamese refugee camp during the influx of migration in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.   - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population.

In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the hotel in which, combined with his house, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States?, what is it ?

Summarize this article: In a 289-137 vote, the House on Thursday easily approved legislation that requires new screening requirements on refugees from Syria and Iraq before they can enter the United States.      ADVERTISEMENT      Forty-seven Democrats defied President Obama’s veto threat and backed the bill — enough to override a presidential veto given the six Democrats and two Republicans who missed the vote.      The 47 Democrats who voted for the bill ranged from centrist Blue Dogs, vulnerable lawmakers in tough reelection races and even one member of leadership: Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), who heads House Democrats' communications efforts.      Two Republicans voted against the bill: Reps. Walter Jones (N.C.) and Steve King (Iowa).      The outcome suggests the House could override Obama if he vetoes the measure, although there's no guarantee that Democrats will side against the president if they are asked to sustain a veto.      The big question is whether the House will get a chance at an override vote.      The legislation will now go to the Senate, where it may face a tougher path to passage.      Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) vowed to block the House bill if it is considered by the upper chamber after the Thanksgiving recess.      “The problem is not with refugees,” Reid said. “I don’t think we’ll be dealing with it over here.”      When asked about the prospect of Obama vetoing the legislation, Reid said, “Don’t worry, it won’t get passed. Next question?”      Democrats in the upper chamber have been divided over the issue, and both parties have their eyes on winning a Senate majority in next year’s elections.      The House vote comes less than a week after at least 129 people were killed in the Paris terrorist attacks.      The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for the carnage, and is also a big factor in the wave of refugees from Iraq and Syria flowing into Europe.      Fears that terrorists could enter the United States through the refugee program sparked the House bill, which moved quickly through the chamber. Obama has planned to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the United States.      Reports that one of the Paris attackers entered Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee has further fanned the flames.      The legislation would prevent any refugees from Syria or Iraq from entering the United States until the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence certify that none of them are dangerous.      “If our law enforcement and our intelligence community cannot verify that each and every person is not a security threat, then they shouldn't be allowed in,” said Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanLawmakers shrug off shutdown drama Shutdown to drag on for days after Senate adjourns without deal Both sides play blame game on first day of shutdown MORE (R-Wis.).      “We cannot and we should not wait to act. Not when our national security is at stake,” he added.      Obama has engaged in an at times personal war of words with Republicans over the legislation, even as he continues a foreign trip.      He argued that keeping out Syrian refugees fleeing terrorism and war in their country was an affront to American values.      In a statement outlining its veto threat, the Obama administration argued the bill would “provide no meaningful additional security for the American people” and impose new certification requirements that effectively end the refugee program.      “The United States has always been and should always be a place of refuge,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty.”      Yet top administration officials, just hours before the vote, struggled to convince undecided House Democrats to oppose the bill.      The Obama administration has said the vetting process typically already takes more than a year for each refugee. But FBI Director James Comey acknowledged in a hearing last month that certain gaps remain in the administration’s ability to fully vet each refugee applicant.      If the bill is blocked in the Senate, House Republicans are already looking toward a catchall government spending bill, known as an omnibus, as their best leverage to force the Obama administration’s hand.      Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said he would vote against a spending bill that doesn’t contain provisions halting the refugee program.      “I think that we have to exert maximum leverage,” Salmon told The Hill.      Those threats raise the possibility of a showdown over the issue that could lead to a government shutdown. Congress must pass legislation by Dec. 11 to keep the government open.      Alexander Bolton and Scott Wong contributed.      This story was updated at 3:52 p.m. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — In a stinging rebuke to President Barack Obama by Republicans as well as members of his own party, the House ignored a veto threat Thursday and overwhelmingly approved Republican legislation erecting fresh hurdles for Syrian and Iraqi refugees trying to enter the United States.      Dozens of Democrats joined Republicans as the House passed the measure 289-137. That margin exceeded the two-thirds majority required to override a veto, and it came despite a rushed, early morning visit to the Capitol by top administration officials in a futile attempt to limit Democratic defections for the measure.      Thursday's vote came six days after a burst of bombings and shootings in Paris killed 129 people, wounded many more and revived post-9/11 jitters in the U.S. and Europe. The attacks have turned the question of admitting people fleeing war-torn Syria and Iraq into a high-stakes political issue in both the United States and Europe, and many congressional Democrats were willing to vote against their party's lame duck president for fear of angering voters nervous about security at home.      Democrats opposing the GOP bill said the U.S. has no business abandoning its age-old values, including being a safe haven for people fleeing countries racked by violence. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks and controls vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, despite a growing military campaign against them by the U.S. and other nations.      \\"Defeating terrorism should not mean slamming the door in the faces of those fleeing the terrorists. We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty,\\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.      Republicans said that in dangerous times, the government must first protect its own.      \\"It is against the values of our nation and the values of a free society to give terrorists the opening they are looking for\\" by not tightening entry restrictions, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.      Before Thursday's House vote, the White House sent chief of staff Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to the Capitol to try winning over Democrats. Democratic aides said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., had a forceful exchange with Johnson, saying that opposition to the bill would be a terrible vote for Democrats that could cost them seats in next year's elections.      With the House's 246 Republicans ready to solidly support the legislation, the administration was eager to keep the final tally for the bill below the two-thirds margin required to override a veto. In a sign of the conflicting political undercurrents confronting Democrats, senior House Democrats said they did not push rank-and-file lawmakers to oppose the bill.      \\"I've said to them from the start, 'Nobody's asked you to do anything. Do whatever works for you, for your district,'\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who opposed the legislation, told journalists.      Freshman Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb., who faces a tough re-election fight next year, called the Paris attacks \\"a game changer\\" and supported the bill, saying, \\"I cannot sit back and ignore the concerns of my constituents and the American public.\\"      The measure, which in effect would suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, would require the FBI to conduct background checks on people coming to the U.S. from those countries. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee \\"is not a threat to the security of the United States.\\"      On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. should welcome refugees from the region and bolster America's defenses and intelligence operations.      On the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who hasn't yet scheduled debate on the issue, said Thursday it is time \\"to press pause\\" so policy makers could decide whether adequate vetting procedures are in place, calling it \\"the most responsible thing for the administration to do right now.\\"      Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he's been disgusted in recent days by the comments from Republicans and called it \\"fear-mongering and bigotry.\\"      In a statement assuring a veto, the White House said the GOP bill would not improve Americans' security. It said the legislation \\"would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.\\"      Currently, the refugee screening process typically takes 18 to 24 months and includes interviews, fingerprinting and database crosschecks by several federal agencies. Syrians undergo additional screening involving data from the U.N. Refugee Agency and interviews by Homeland Security Department officials trained to question Syrians.      The Obama administration wants to increase the 70,000 refugees to be admitted from around the world this year by 10,000, with much of the increase for Syrians.      The White House said that of 2,174 Syrians admitted to the U.S. since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, none has been arrested or deported because of allegations they harbored extremist ambitions.      ___      AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and writers Andrew Taylor and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| AP Photo House approves Syrian refugees bill The bill sees near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats.      The House passed a bill Thursday that would block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country unless they pass strict background checks — setting up a collision with President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats.      The bill had near unanimous support from Republicans, who were joined by 47 Democrats — even after the Obama administration made a last-minute pitch to persuade wavering House Democrats to oppose the GOP-written bill. And with 289 \\"yes\\" votes, Republicans also won a veto-proof majority for the measure.      Story Continued Below      The bipartisan support was a rebuke of President Barack Obama by House Democrats who felt that the administration failed to make a compelling case as to why they should vote against the Republican-authored bill when it was bad politics to do so.      “I think a lot of us went in with open minds and really wanted to understand the administration’s position on this,” said New York Democrat Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “It is offensive to me that we would stigmatize refugees…but if you read the bill what you find is that you have a pretty simple certification process sitting on top of an existing and extensive screening process that most of us believe works pretty well.”      Maloney voted for the bill.      The vote was a significant loss for the White House — perhaps the biggest setback since most of the House Democratic Caucus voted against Obama on a trade bill in mid-June. Thursday’s vote, coupled with the Iranian nuclear agreement bill from September, also shows that Republicans plan to make national security a key issue in the 2016 elections.      The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged Thursday that the Syria bill won’t make it to Obama’s desk. Senators will likely attempt to tack the measure as a rider to the government spending bill that Congress has to address in December.      “We’ve explained here in some detail [that] the problem is not with refugees. I haven’t read the House language,” Reid said during a press conference on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to be dealing with it over here.”      Already conservative House Republicans are signaling they won’t vote to support December’s so-called omnibus bill unless it includes beefed-up provisions for vetting Syrian refugees while Democrats in the House are calling for a budget bill free of all contentious policy riders.      The final 289- 137 vote was expected as House Democrats began signaling early Thursday there was not broad support in their caucus to take a tough vote on national security.      In response, the White House dispatched chief of staff Denis McDonough and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to speak with Democrats just hours before the House vote.      It was clear, lawmakers said, that the White House is trying to keep the number of Democratic defections low. But Multiple sources said McDonough and Johnson's \\"in the weeds\\" presentation didn't receive wide support in the room. The administration officials tried to make the case that the current vetting system was enough and that the Department of Homeland Security found the process too burdensome under the Republican-authored bill.      That message fell hard with Democrats. Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), who voted for the bill, said he not swayed by Johnson’s pitch to Democrats that the Homeland Security Department doesn’t have time to certify refugees.      “If you look at the bill, it’s hard to see how it’s as awful as the administration is portraying it as,” Peters said.      Sources said Maloney pushed back against the White House, saying the issue is \\"toxic\\" — even if Democrats oppose the Republican bill on policy grounds — because of the complicated messaging surrounding the national security issue. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas also questioned whether the opposition from the White House was wise for rank-and-file members of the caucus.      Rep. Gerry Connolly said White House officials didn't make an effective pitch during the meeting with Democrats. He urged them to drop their opposition to the Republican bill.      \\"It's one more assurance that those coming into the country are screened,\\" the Virginia Democrat said of the GOP-sponsored measure. \\"That seems to me not an imprudent measure under the circumstances.\\"      House Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to oppose the legislation but did not formally whip colleagues. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made an informal whip count Wednesday night to gauge where the caucus is.      \\"Nobody is asking you to do anything but listen,\\" Pelosi told lawmakers during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to sources in the room.      Before the vote, Pelosi, who voted against the GOP bill, said the current process is sufficiently thorough.      “The process that is currently in place is thorough and robust and long as it is fully implemented and not diluted…it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees while protecting the American people,” the California Democrat said on the floor.      Pelosi did push for Democrats to support a procedural move known as a motion to recommit. That move — essentially a Democratic alternative — would require the Department of Homeland Security only to certify that refugees have passed requirement standards.      It was drafted by Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on a Judiciary subcommittee tasked with immigration.      The Republican legislation, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, would require the FBI, Homeland Security Department and director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that any refugee from Syria or Iraq is \\"not a threat to the security of the United States\\" before being allowed to settle in the United States. President Barack Obama has proposed allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the country this year, part of the Western response to the wave of millions of refugees fleeing that country's bloody civil war and Islamic State-related violence.      The White House has threatened to veto the measure.       ||||| Summary:","output":"On Thursday the US House of Representatives voted 289-137 in favour of legislation that would suspend the Obama Administration's plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year, increasing the chances that the plan will be blocked in the Senate. The decision comes despite President Obama threatening that he would veto the legislation if it reached the White House. The legislation, which passed with near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats despite a last-minute visit from top administration officials, sets strict security requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees and only allows entry into the US after the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence have certified that the refugees pose no danger to the US public. The new legislation must now win the approval of the US Senate before it is presented to the President for his signature; Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, vowed to block the Senate vote after Thanksgiving recess."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: If you're here out of season, the costumes, worn year after year, will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi. Hypothesis: The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise provides a conditional statement about when the costumes are on display at the Casal de San Jordi, specifically mentioning that they are on display during \\"off-season\\" at the 18th-century location. The premise does not make any claims about the state of the costumes outside of this condition. Now let us examine the hypothesis which states that \\"The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi.\\" This hypothesis is not directly addressed by the premise and does not necessarily follow from it. The hypothesis claims a situation where the costumes are not on display; however, the premise only discusses when the costumes are indeed on display, which is during the off-season. To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should consider if there are any situations where the premise is true and the hypothesis is false. According to the premise, if it is off-season, then the costumes will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi. Therefore, during off-season, the hypothesis claiming that the costumes are not on display is false, which confirms that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In summary, the hypothesis that \\"The costumes are not on display at the Casal de San Jordi\\" is not entailed by the premise that \\"If you're here out of season, the costumes, worn year after year, will be on display in the 18th-century Casal de San Jordi.\\" The premise explicitly discusses when the costumes are on display, while the hypothesis posits a situation where they are not. As the premise does not provide enough information to fully support the hypothesis, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved, first to Derry City, where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949. His mother, Monica, and the two boys then moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Gallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland,and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly, a member of The Irish Showband. In 1961, Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop of Cork's McCurtain Street. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under PS100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother Donal recalled: \\"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds... in today's money you couldn't even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds... my mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\\"  The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one.  Most of the paint was removed from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as evidenced from contemporary photographs. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image.  It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck, with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring. The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays. On 21 and 22 October 2011, Rory's brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \\"Cradle Rock\\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster.

Glenn Maxwell starred with bat and ball for the hosts, scoring 95 and taking 4-46, and Mitchell Johnson took 3-27 on his international return. England had Australia 60-4 but the hosts recovered to post 278-8. Johnson swept through England's top order and Maxwell's off-spinners did the rest as England were 166 all out. England have now lost 13 of their last 15 one-day internationals against Australia in Australia and have only two warm-up games before they face them again in their World Cup opener on 14 February. Captain Eoin Morgan still has several puzzles to solve, not least his own patchy form with the bat - the left-hander made 121 in the tri-series opener in Sydney but has posted scores of 0, 2 and 0 since. The hosts were 0-1 after James Anderson dismissed Aaron Finch with the third ball of the innings and David Warner followed in the seventh over, deflecting a lifting ball from Anderson to point. Stuart Broad did for George Bailey, the under-pressure Tasmanian fending a short ball to short-leg to leave Australia tottering on 46-3. In-form Steve Smith batted confidently for his 40 but was stumped by Jos Buttler at the second attempt after coming down the pitch to Moeen Ali. But Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh put on 141 for the fifth wicket, the former demonstrating his full array of strokes and bringing up his ninth one-day international fifty with a reverse pull for four. Maxwell hit four boundaries in one Chris Woakes over before falling to Broad in the next, while Marsh was run out for 60 soon after. James Faulkner hit four sixes  - including three in one Woakes over - to race to an unbeaten, 24-ball fifty and transform what would have been a below-par total into a testing target. Anderson was again the pick of England's bowlers with 2-38 while Woakes's bowling figures of 0-89 from 10 overs were the fourth worst for England in ODI history. England's openers made a confident start before Ian Bell nicked a fine delivery from Josh Hazlewood and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin snaffled a brilliant one-handed catch. Enter Johnson, who took 37 wickets in Australia's Ashes whitewash of England last winter but had played no international cricket in 2015. James Taylor never looked settled before skewing Johnson to gully, where Maxwell took an excellent catch diving low to his left. And when Moeen fended a wicked Johnson bouncer to second slip and Morgan shouldered arms to a straight delivery next ball, England were in disarray on 46-4. Faulkner picked up his 50th ODI wicket when he had Joe Root lbw with his first delivery, but the Tasmanian all-rounder was forced to leave the field soon after with a side injury. Buttler looked in fine form before reverse-sweeping off-spinner Maxwell to substitute fielder Pat Cummings and Woakes was gone next ball, offering up a simple caught and bowled. Broad played some big shots before holing out to deep mid-wicket, Ravi Bopara became Maxwell's fourth victim when he holed out to extra-cover and Hazlewood bowled Steve Finn to wrap up the win. What is a summary of this text?","output":"In this one-day international match, Australia staged a remarkable comeback to defeat England by 112 runs, with Glenn Maxwell being the star of the game with 95 runs and 4-46 as a bowler. The Australian team managed to recover from a difficult 60-4 start to post a score of 278-8. Mitchell Johnson's return to international cricket brought a 3-27 bowling performance, which significantly impacted England's top order. As England failed to chase down the target, they were all out at 166. This loss adds to England's poor record against Australia in Australia, with only two warm-up games remaining before they face each other again in the World Cup opener on February 14. England's captain, Eoin Morgan, has to address his own inconsistent form with the bat, as well as strategize improvements for the team.  James Anderson stood out as England's best bowler, with figures of 2-38, while Chris Woakes experienced a tough game with 0-89 from 10 overs, marking the fourth worst for England in ODI history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are typically worn by female dancers, they are called flamenco heel, often with traje de flamenca costumes. Male flamenco dancers traditionally wear short, heeled boots, although there are now some flamenco shoe styles available for men. Can we infer the following? Flamenco dancers, both male and female, wear the same shoes.","output":"We cannot infer that flamenco dancers, both male and female, wear the same shoes based on the given information. In fact, it is evident that there are differences in the footwear worn by male and female flamenco dancers. Here is a detailed explanation: Flamenco is a traditional Spanish dance with its roots in Andalusia, Spain. It is characterized by its emotive movements, intricate footwork, and unique musical accompaniments. The performance typically consists of three parts: cante (singing), baile (dancing), and toque (guitar playing). Flamenco shoes for female dancers, often referred to as flamenco heels, are characterized by their distinct design. They usually have a low or medium heel that is thick and sturdy, providing support and stability for the dancer during their performance. The closed-toe shoe is fashioned from materials such as leather or suede and often has a strap running across the instep to help keep the shoe in place during the quick footwork and intense movements that are typical of flamenco dancing. The soles of these shoes are typically made of hard materials, which help to produce the clear and distinctive sound of foot stomping, known as \\"taconeo,\\" on the wooden dance floor. In addition, traditional female flamenco shoes may feature decorative designs, such as stitching, tassels, or subtle embellishments, which can complement the colors and patterns of the traje de flamenca, the flamenco dress worn by female dancers. These dresses, known for their ruffles and bold colors, are an integral part of the flamenco costume and performance. On the other hand, male flamenco dancers often wear short, heeled boots that are specifically designed for their performance requirements. These boots are usually made from materials such as leather or suede and have a low, sturdy heel that aids in stability and balance during dance movements. Similar to the female flamenco shoes, these boots have hard soles for producing the characteristic percussive sounds. It is important to note that there are also some modern flamenco shoe styles available for men that share design similarities with female flamenco heels. Despite this, there remain key differences in the overall design and aesthetic, ensuring that the shoes cater to the specific requirements of male and female flamenco dancers. In conclusion, the original statement is incorrect, as male and female flamenco dancers do not wear the same shoes. The differences in design and style are reflective of the unique performance demands of each gender, paying close attention to factors such as support, stability, sound production, and aesthetic design."},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What do you do to weapons when you want to gather them?

Given the question: Given the below context:  The \\"ship portrait\\" had a long history in maritime art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels.  The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \\"plats\\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished.

Sears, Roebuck & Company, a giant mail-order house, opened its first eight retail stores in 1925, and operated 338 by 1930, and 595 by 1940. The chains reached a middle-class audience, that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \\"windowless\\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.

Here is a question about this article: During the earlier medieval period, the vocal music from the liturgical genre, predominantly Gregorian chant, was monophonic, using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line. Polyphonic vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the high medieval era, becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. What is the answer to this question: What word means using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line?","output":"The word that means using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line is \\"monophonic.\\" Monophonic music consists of a single melodic line without harmonies or chords, and it stands in contrast to polyphonic music, which incorporates multiple independent melodies that harmonize or intertwine. In the earlier medieval period, Gregorian chant was a prominent example of monophonic music within the liturgical genre, as it featured a single melodic line sung by the choir or soloists without any harmonization or instrumental accompaniment. It was not until the high medieval era that polyphonic vocal genres began to emerge, steadily gaining popularity and becoming more prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th centuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brett is much more supportive to Jimmy than Ryan, since","output":"Brett shares a similar passion for art and model painting. Over the years, their friendship has continued to flourish, and they've developed a strong bond based on their mutual love for the intricate and delicate process of painting models. Ryan, on the other hand, doesn't quite understand the appeal of this hobby or the time and effort it requires. He's not inherently unsupportive of Jimmy's interests, but he simply cannot relate to them. As a result, Jimmy finds it difficult to connect with Ryan on a deeper level when it comes to discussing and sharing his artistic pursuits. Brett's support manifests itself in various ways. Not only does he encourage Jimmy by acknowledging and appreciating the fine details and care that goes into each individual model, but he also provides constructive feedback and suggestions for improving the overall aesthetic of a piece. Furthermore, Brett often accompanies Jimmy to hobby shops and exhibitions, where they spend hours together exploring new painting techniques, acquiring unique model kits, and seeking inspiration from other artists. In addition, the two friends often organize painting sessions, during which they work on separate projects but share the experience, knowledge, and camaraderie that the painting process entails. These sessions become special rituals for them, where they find solace in working with their hands and creating beautiful miniature worlds full of intricate details, colors, and textures. Brett also actively seeks out opportunities for Jimmy to showcase his work in local galleries, art fairs, and online forums for model painters. He strongly believes that it's essential to offer exposure to Jimmy's breathtaking models so that a wider audience can appreciate the meticulous craftsmanship and artistry that goes into each creation. Despite the apparent lack of connection between Jimmy and Ryan with regards to model painting, the three friends still share several other common interests. They frequently hang out together, indulge in various recreational activities, and have a strong bond that transcends their differing passions. In conclusion, the friendship among Jimmy, Brett, and Ryan is a nuanced one, characterized by the unique dynamics between each pair. While Brett's unwavering support and enthusiasm for painting models aligns perfectly with Jimmy's interests, Ryan's limited involvement in this particular aspect has no bearing on the overall strength of their friendships. The beauty of their connection lies in their ability to maintain close bonds while respecting and appreciating the individual passions of each friend. It is through their shared experiences, mutual support, and understanding that they continue to nurture and grow their friendships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fill a large saucepan, deep skillet, or deep-fryer with the oil.  You've cut your chicken into small pieces, so the oil doesn't need to be too deep, but it should fill about 1/3 of the pan. The ideal frying temperature for oil is usually listed as around 365ºF (or 185ºC).  You can test the oil by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When it browns in fifteen seconds, your oil is ready. It's a good idea to begin with frying just one or two pieces of chicken. This will help you verify that the oil is hot enough and give you an idea of how long it will take to fry the chicken. If you don't want to risk messing up a whole piece of chicken you can cut one piece in half and use that.  If the oil doesn't cover the chicken piece entirely, be sure to rotate it after a couple of minutes. If you rotate too early, the chicken may stick, so allow for a crust to form. Once the chicken is browned and crisped remove it from the oil. Now cut it in half to make sure that it's cooked through. This should take about 5-8 minutes. Once you've finished frying your test pieces, continue frying the remainder of the chicken. Depending upon the size of your pan, you may want to do this in batches. If you fry in batches, place your finished chicken on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. This will help soak up any residual oil and keep the chicken from getting soggy. Keep the oven on a very low setting, around 200ºF or 93ºC. If you fry in batches, you will need to allow the oil to get back up to temperature before adding a new batch. Your finished chicken could get cold in that time. Once you've fried all of your chicken pieces, garnish with finely chopped fresh coriander leaves. You may also want to give the dish a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. All that you need to do now is enjoy this spicy savory treat! Summary:","output":"This article is about making a delicious fried chicken dish. You start by marinating the chicken in spices.

News article: ncaa tournament takeaways sweet 16 dayton flyers michigan state spartans florida gators michigan wolverines That's just the most prominent of our takeaways from each of Saturday's NCAA Tournament games. With eight teams punching their tickets to the Sweet 16, we were impressed in several instances ... and not so much in a couple of cases. Turns out it wasn't just a case of the Flyers getting up for their opening matchup with Ohio State. These guys are genuine giant-slayers, as they proved with Saturday's 55-53 win over No. 3 Syracuse in Buffalo. Sure, the Orange hardly looked like the team that was top-ranked this season, going 0 for 10 on threes, but Dayton defended like crazy and hit clutch shots in Syracuse's back yard. Dayton improved to 11-0 when holding opponents under 60 points. You're kicking yourself you didn't put Dayton in your Sweet 16. Ohio State and Syracuse were two of the biggest second-half swoon teams of the year. The Buckeyes were 15-0, then went 8-8 the rest of the regular season. 'Cuse was 25-0, then went 2-5 in its last seven before the tourney. Dayton, meanwhile, had won its last 10 games against everyone not named Saint Joseph's. If anyone was ripe for an underdog run, it was the Flyers. The No. 1 seed Gators punched their ticket to the Sweet 16 with a dominant 61-45 win over No. 9 Pitt, which beat Colorado by 29 on Thursday. Scottie Wilbekin led Florida with 21 points, including 13 in a seven-minute span of the second half. Wilbekin got the Gators back on track. After an ugly opener, they needed someone to step up, and he came up huge. But the story of the game was that relentless, swarming UF defense, which held Pitt to 19-of-51 shooting. The star of that defense was big man Patric Young. He scored only seven points, but Pitt had no answer for him when it had the ball, as he had four blocks and also pulled down six of Florida's 14 offensive rebounds in 30 minutes. \\"Patric in particular in the first half just couldn't finish around the basket,\\" Gators coach Billy Donovan said. \\"But we overcame that, and I thought our defense in particular -- both halves it was good, but I thought in the second half it really, really was good, and these guys did a really terrific job from start to finish.\\" If the Gators can maintain this level of play on D, nobody is going to beat them. A win is a win, but man, the defending champs are doing it ugly. Louisville had a huge struggle against Manhattan and a very sloppy performance in Saturday's 66-51 win over No. 5 Saint Louis. With Wichita State/Kentucky up next and possibly Michigan in the Elite Eight, it's tough to like Louisville in that region. Saturday's first half, both physically and on the scoreboard, felt more like a football game -- Saint Louis didn't even reach double figures until the 3:44 mark, and Louisville wasn't much better. The good news: Luke Hancock, the Cards' hero against the Jaspers and last year's MOP of the Final Four, continued his hot play in the tournament, hitting four 3-pointers and leading the way with 21 points. Plus, Louisville shot 48 percent in the second half and opened up things late after the teams were tied at 29 with 14:02 to play. Nik Stauskas, the Michigan guard who shot his way into the spotlight as a freshman with six 3-pointers in the national championship game, showed he has grown as much as any of the Wolverines in Saturday's 79-65 win over No. 7 Texas. Stauskas not only nailed four treys en route to a team-high 17 points, but he also had eight assists with no turnovers and even flew down the lane for a furious dunk -- except he missed it. So he's still got room for improvement. But his play illustrates why the No. 2 Wolverines still are flourishing in the absence of injured Mitch McGary, who was the darling of last year's tourney. Michigan is as steady as anyone: two double-digit wins. The first thanks to defense. The second thanks to excellent shooting. With Duke out of the way, the Wolverines have got to be thinking Elite Eight at least. San Diego State and its top star may have flown under the national radar in the Mountain West, but Thames had the game of the day in Saturday's 63-44 win over 12th-seeded North Dakota State. Thames had almost half his team's points with 30, after scoring 23 in the No. 4 Aztecs' tourney opener. Thames did it all for the Aztecs in the first half. He was responsible for 23 of San Diego State's 30 points, scoring 16 and assisting on another three baskets. Thames, who was 9 of 19 from the field, had five assists and ended the comeback hopes of the Bison with a six-point spurt late in the second half. \\"That kid had a couple moves where, well, put it this way, we don't have anybody that can simulate it in practice,\\" Bison coach Saul Phillips said. San Diego State is dangerous, if not entirely schizophrenic. The Aztecs barely get out of the second round, but then they hold the best-shooting team in the country to 44 points. They have wins over Creighton and Kansas, but a loss to Wyoming (?!). They've already played Arizona once and might get the 'Cats again -- just an hour or so drive from their campus. Not to discredit the No. 2 Badgers' 85-77 win over Oregon on Saturday in Milwaukee, but the crowd was roaring for them all night. In a tight game against a very good team, that absurdly pro-Badgers crowd gave them a huge lift. The announcers even said \\"We're 80 miles from Madison, but we may as well be in Madison.\\" Coach Bo Ryan said it was more than that: \\"Do you know how many fast-break points they got in the second half? Zero,\\" Ryan said. \\"Oregon, one of the quickest teams in the country, so you've got to give the players a heck of a lot of credit.\\" No. 4 Michigan State, a popular pick to win it all, ended No. 12 Harvard's tournament run, but the Spartans had more trouble than many people expected against the Ivy League champs. Luckily, Branden Dawson scored a career-high 26 points to help the Spartans fend off a wild rally Saturday for an 80-73 victory. \\"That's one thing Coach Amaker talks about, that we're not just built for the Ivy League, we're built to go past that,\\" Harvard junior forward Jonah Travis said. \\"That's one of our main goals, to match up with teams like that and beat teams like that.\\" If the Spartans get a career night from a different player every game, they will be hard to beat. In the Spartans' tournament opener, it was Adreian Payne scoring a career-high 41 points. This is what we were afraid of with No. 2 Villanova: nice record, but a bad strength of schedule -- 51st -- and a super-red-flag loss to Seton Hall in the Big East tournament set the table for doubters. UConn was just more battle-tested with 12 games against the RPI top 50. Don't tell the Wildcats and Huskies that this wasn't a Big East battle. Jay Wright's Wildcats brought the best out of Kevin Ollie's Huskies, who may now be in the AAC but played 'Nova like it was back in the day. They won every category in the stat book and with Shabazz Napier on top of his game, there was no stopping them -- even when Napier limped to the sideline with an injury late in the game. He just came back in and hit an acrobatic layup to help seal the 77-65 win. Napier had 21 of his 25 points in the second half.

Summarize: Counsel for his widow Marina told a hearing if proven this would be an \\"act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism\\". Mr Litvinenko, 43, is thought to have been poisoned with polonium-210 after meeting two Russians for tea at a central London hotel in November 2006. Sir Robert Owen said the full inquest would take place in early 2013. Parts of a police report into Mr Litvinenko's death will be withheld to omit a section about his alleged links to British intelligence. Prime suspect Andrei Lugovoi has since been elected as a Russian MP. Ben Emmerson QC, counsel for Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina, said they believed Russia was responsible. \\"If that hypothesis were to be evidentially substantiated, this would be an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism on the streets of London.\\" The death of Mr Litvinenko, a former Russian security officer who had obtained asylum in Britain, led to a major diplomatic incident in 2006 as the Kremlin was accused of masterminding his murder. Thursday's pre-inquest review hearing was told \\"interested parties\\" would receive a summary of Scotland Yard's investigation report into Mr Litvinenko's death but certain intelligence reports would be withheld, including where the Metropolitan Police was asked to examine any links between Mr Litvinenko and British intelligence. By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Alexander Litvinenko's killing prompted a major diplomatic row with Russia - diplomats were expelled and intelligence and security co-operation suspended. Now an inquest may aggravate relations which have still not fully healed. The reason is that the family of Mr Litvinenko have been pushing for the inquest to examine the possible role of the Russian state in the killing. His widow told me she believed the Russian state was responsible because of the impossibility of anything other than a state getting hold of the rare substance polonium. The coroner indicated he would most likely be looking at Russia's role and expects to take evidence from there. That may prove difficult. But there may also be difficulties closer to home, especially when it comes to information being released which may show any links between MI6 and Mr Litvinenko which the government may want to keep quiet. Counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said: \\"This redaction, of course, should not be taken as indicating one way or the other whether Mr Litvinenko did indeed have any such contact.\\" He said all competing theories would be examined, adding: \\"The court is committed to transparency.\\" Mr Emmerson said Mrs Litvinenko \\"is keen that the significance of all the evidence, including that which is redacted, is in one way or another fairly and independently evaluated and that as much as is possible should be made public\\". He said she wanted to know if it was \\"a targeted assassination of a British citizen committed by agents of a foreign state in the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom\\". Mr Davies said some foreign witnesses could give evidence by video link. Mr Lugovoi is represented as an interested person but Dimitri Kovtun, another Russian former agent who was present at a meeting with Mr Litvinenko on 1 November 2006, is not. Others with interested person status include Home Secretary Theresa May, Mrs Litvinenko and her son Anatoli, and Russian tycoon Boris Berezvosky. Sir Robert, a High Court judge appointed as an assistant deputy coroner for the inquest, apologised for its delay saying there would be no further delay. A website has been launched for the inquest, which gives details on the process and lawyers' biographies. British prosecutors named Mr Lugovoi as the main suspect but he was later elected as a Russian MP and Moscow refused to send him to the UK for questioning. He has denied involvement. Prime Minister David Cameron raised the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his recent visit to London. Earlier this year the then Justice Secretary, Ken Clarke, wrote to the then coroner asking for clarification about the estimated Â£4m inquest costs.","output":"The inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian security officer, who is believed to have been poisoned with polonium-210 in 2006 in London, implicates the Russian state as potentially responsible. If proven, this event would be deemed an \\"act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism.\\" The former Russian security officer had obtained asylum in Britain, and his death led to a major diplomatic incident in 2006, with the Kremlin being accused of masterminding the murder. As a result, Litvinenko's killing prompted a drastic decline in diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia, including expulsion of diplomats and suspension of intelligence and security cooperation. In 2013, an inquest into Litvinenko's death is set to take place, which may further strain the relationship between the two nations.

After the divorce, he and his mother moved to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Context: Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the \\"communal\\" atmosphere as thus: \\"With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.\\" A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.  My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work and said it solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit \\"All of the Lights\\", and Billboard hits \\"Power\\", \\"Monster\\", and \\"Runaway\\", the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name directed by and starring West. During this time, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 - December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a \\"snub\\" by several media outlets.  2011 saw West embark on a festival tour to commemorate the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy performing and headlining numerous festivals including; SWU Music & Arts, Austin City Limits, Oya Festival, Flow Festival, Live Music Festival, The Big Chill, Essence Music Festival, Lollapalooza and Coachella which was described by The Hollywood Reporter as \\"one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time\\", West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z in August 2011. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. \\"Niggas in Paris\\" became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. The co-headlining Watch the Throne Tour kicked off in October 2011 and concluded in June 2012.  In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Clique\\". West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens.

This process involves: 1. The accumulation of organic matter: The process you've outlined describes the formation of fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas, which begins with the accumulation of organic material, predominantly microscopic plants and animals, also known as plankton that live in water bodies. When these organisms die, they sink to the bottom of the sea or lake where they accumulate on the seabed. This biological material gets trapped within sedimentary layers, triggering the transformation process. This sedimentation layering is typically fine-grained and gets deposited in environments with low or absent oxygen, allowing the organic matter to be preserved and not decompose fully.  The above step completes the transformation sequence, resulting in a complete process as follows: 1. The accumulation of organic matter. 2. Over time, more sediment piles on top of the organic matter, increasing the weight and pressure. 3. The resultant heat and pressure transform the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance called kerogen. 4. Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually start to crack due to continued heat and pressure. 5.

While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers mismatched payments. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him.

A metal-halide lamp is an electrical lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides (compounds of metals with bromine or iodine). It is a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) gas discharge lamp. Developed in the 1960s, they are similar to mercury vapor lamps, but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube, which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light. The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide. Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature, the sodium dissociates from the iodine, adding orange and reds to the lamp's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes. As a result, metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75--100 lumens per watt, which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light. Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours. As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light, metal halides as of 2005 were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry. They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial, industrial, and public spaces, such as parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps (xenon headlights). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is metal halide the same as mercury vapor?","output":"No, metal halide is not the same as mercury vapor. They are both types of high-intensity discharge (HID) gas discharge lamps, but metal halide lamps have additional metal halide compounds, like sodium iodide, which improve the efficiency and color of the light compared to mercury vapor lamps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Set in 1934 Paris, the film opens with Richard di Nardo, a young hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), aka Toddy; Richard dresses, takes money from Toddy's wallet and leaves Toddy's apartment. Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

She had been planning this event for weeks, and she wanted it to be perfect for her husband. It was their 10th anniversary and she had gathered their closest friends and family to join in the celebration. The small boutique shop where they first met held a special meaning for both of them, and she knew hosting the party there would make the occasion all the more memorable. She had spent countless hours conceptualizing the perfect decorations, planning the menu, and coordinating with a local band to add a touch of elegance and entertainment to the event. However, the shop owner, Mrs. Larson, was hesitant to allow such an event to take place in her quaint space, fearing damage or customer inconvenience. Determined to make her dream a reality, the woman, Amelia, decided to plead her case with Mrs. Larson. She explained the sentimental significance of the shop and described her well-thought-out plans that took into consideration every precaution to ensure things would run smoothly. “In addition to hiring a professional cleaning service to come in afterwards, I’ll set up a dedicated area for the party that won’t hinder your regular customers, and I'll schedule the entire event after your shop's normal business hours,” Amelia promised determinedly. Mrs. Larson pondered this proposal for a few moments before finally agreeing, her fondness for Amelia and her husband, George, tipping the scale. With excitement in her heart, Amelia got to work. As the day of the party drew nearer, she transformed the shop into an elegant and inviting space. She delicately adorned the windows with fairy lights, hung tasteful floral arrangements throughout, and created an intimate sitting area with plush chairs and a cozy fireplace. The menu showcased a gourmet selection of finger foods, sourced from a renowned local caterer. Amelia chose mini-quiches, smoked salmon canapés, stuffed mushrooms, and various other delicacies. The dessert station, meanwhile, tempted guests with an assortment of miniature fruit tarts, chocolate-covered strawberries, and the pièce de résistance - a gorgeous two-tiered anniversary cake, adorned with intricate icing detailing and a fondant sculpture reminiscent of the couple’s first dance. The local band Amelia had hired, the Moonlight Serenaders, had a repertoire of classic love songs that set the perfect ambiance for the celebration. The soft melodies of the saxophone, piano, and guitar gently filled the shop, stirring nostalgia among the guests. As the evening unfolded, the party proved to be an enchanting affair. George was genuinely surprised and touched by his wife's thoughtfulness and the incredible execution of her vision. Their friends and family enjoyed the engaging conversations, delicious food, and heartwarming atmosphere all while reminiscing about the experiences the couple had shared over the past decade. Even Mrs. Larson could not hide her delight in seeing her quaint store transformed into an elegant venue. The evening was filled with laughter, love, and profound emotion, which only strengthened the bond between Amelia, George, and their loved ones. Throughout the night, there were countless toasts, heartfelt speeches, and shared memories, making this night a truly unforgettable experience for all those present. The love between Amelia and George was ever-present, proving to be a beautiful reminder of the power of love and the importance of cherishing the moments and spaces that have defined their relationship. As the anniversary party drew to an end and the Moonlight Serenaders played the couple's favorite slow dance, Amelia and George held each other close, swaying gently to the rhythm while murmuring words of gratitude and love, knowing they had created a memory they would treasure forever. The woman's plan had come to fruition, not only had she successfully hosted her dream 10th-anniversary party, she had deepened her connections with their friends, family, and Mrs. Larson. Such a night now held a special place in the hearts of all who attended, proving that with determination, love, and a little persuasion, even the most ordinary of spaces could become the backdrop for the most magical of celebrations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope?  As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.  Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators.  Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low  magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.

If you let your nails grow too long and get jagged and rough, they are more likely to break off and get weaker. Your nails are kind of like your hair-without regular upkeep, they start to get weaker at the tips. Pick from:  A). As you see, sticking to a simple amount of cutting and filing will ensure you don't have to clip or file your nails every two days. Aim to get at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) off your nail every five days.;  B). This can lead to the uneven ends and edges of your nails falling out. Cut your nails to a normal length and clip them at regular intervals into the shape you desire.;  C). Trimming your nails regularly is one important way to help them stay strong. Trim your nails with a nail clipper or nail scissors-not a regular pair of scissors or any other type of trimming instrument.;  D). If you want to be more conservative in all areas of your body, trim your nails once a week at least. Clip shorter nails every other day, especially on the sides.;","output":"Okay, little one! Strengthening your nails is like taking care of a small plant, so they grow nice and strong. Here's what you can do: C).

A: He felt the possibility of Nazi Germany developing the bomb before the Allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the U.S.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer correctly states that the individual in question was motivated to contribute to the development of the atomic bomb due to concerns about Nazi Germany potentially developing the weapon first. To provide a more detailed and long answer: Several factors led to the reasoning behind helping make the atomic bomb. One of the main concerns at the time was that scientists and military strategists were aware that atomic bomb research was taking place in Germany, and there was a genuine fear that the Nazis could develop the weapon before the United States and its Allies. This fear was further amplified when Albert Einstein, the renowned physicist, wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in August 1939, alerting him to the possibility of constructing an atomic bomb and urging him to consider supporting research in this area. Einstein, a German Jewish refugee who had fled the Nazis, was well aware of the potential threat such a weapon could pose in the hands of Hitler's regime. Shortly after receiving Einstein's letter, Roosevelt authorized the formation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium, which later evolved into the Manhattan Project – a top-secret program aimed at developing an atomic bomb. Many scientists who worked on the project shared similar concerns about the Nazis potentially achieving this devastating capability first. They felt that their efforts could deter Hitler from using such a weapon or, at the very least, ensure that the Allies had a response if the Nazis were successful. Additionally, some scientists believed that the development of the atomic bomb was an inevitable outcome of the scientific progress being made in the field of nuclear physics, and if they didn't help to create it, someone else eventually would. They felt a responsibility to contribute their skills and knowledge to ensure that the weapon was developed and used with the best of intentions, rather than leaving it to be potentially used for more nefarious purposes. In summary, the primary reasoning behind helping to create the atomic bomb was the fear of Nazi Germany developing the weapon first and the potential catastrophic consequences that could follow. Scientists involved in the project felt compelled to use their knowledge and expertise to develop the bomb under the controlled and responsible oversight of the United States and its Allies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it \\"the finest building in the national capital\\".

This game would be marked as Dolphins QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start.  Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker.  In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael.  In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville.

The wall needs to be smooth and clean before you apply the tiles to the backsplash area.  Take some time to inspect the wall where you will be applying the tiles to spot any damages that exist. You should patch holes in the wall with spackling compound or joint compound and then sand the surface if you spot damaged areas. Take mild detergent and water, and clean the walls.  You could use dish detergent. Remember that some adhesives won’t adhere to grease. You can also clean walls with trisodium phosphate and water. Look for this cleaner in home project stores. If you spot any oil or grease stains, clean those too. You can do so with a degreaser or a primer if a soft cloth with detergent doesn’t do the job. Let the surface dry before you continue with installation. Figure out where the tile is going to go before you actually apply it to the kitchen wall. Sometimes, it works best to center your tile around a focal point like a faucet.  Mark the start and the end point for the tile so you know how much you are going to need and where you plan to put it. Lay out the tile on the floor or on a large table to make sure the layout works, then measure it to be sure it fits the dimensions on the wall. Use tile spacers to account for grout. Put tile spacers in the corners of the tiles as you lay them to create even grout lines. Some smaller tiles have small protrusions called lugs that fit into the tiles next to them to create space for the grout. Grout is a mortar or paste used to fill the spaces between the tiles, giving it a finished look. Start with the spot on the wall that you can most easily see. Then, move outward and upward from that point. Use a level or straight edge to make sure the tile isn’t crooked. You might need to cut tiles if they won’t fit. A tile cutter will work for ceramic or porcelain tiles. Natural stone or thicker glass tiles may require a wet saw. Be very careful when using any cutting instruments. Purchase powdered thin-set mortar for natural stone mosaic tile. You will want to get this ready next. If you have ceramic or porcelain tiles, you may purchase mastic adhesive instead.  The mortar package will instruct you on how much water to put in the bucket, in addition to the mortar powder. Mix it. Mastic adhesive is often already mixed by the manufacturer. Let the mortar stand for about 5 to 10 more minutes, and then mix it again. Usually, you will only have a few hours to use the mortar after mixing it. Again, check the directions on the package. There are some mortars that you use right away after mixing. Again check the package for instructions as it can vary by brand! Many people suggest mastic adhesive glue for ceramic or porcelain tiles, and mortar for natural stone or other tile backsplashes.  Start spreading the mortar or mastic on the wall where you will place the tiles.  You will want to begin with a 2-foot section. Spread the mortar in a thin layer by using a trowel. Press it at a 45 degree angle. This method will make the mortar fully adhere to the wall. Now, use a notched edge of the trowel to add more mortar on it, and comb even ridges in one direction.  Working in small sections helps prevent the mortar from drying as you apply the tile. Use the trowel to apply mastic in similar fashion.  You will want to use the right trowel size. If you are using natural stone tile, you will want a notch trowel that is ¼ by ¼ inch in size. You may choose thinset/adhesive for glass tile instead or tile with adhesive on the backs. Summary:","output":"To prepare a wall for tiling, first you need to inspect it for damages. Patch any holes using a spackling compound or a joint compound, then sand the surface to make it smooth. The wall then needs to be cleaned with a mild detergent and water to remove grease that could prevent adhesive from sticking properly. For stubborn oil or grease stains, a degreaser or a primer can be used. Mark out where the tiles will go and lay them out on a table or the floor, using tile spacers to account for grout. Start tiling from the most visible point on the wall, using a level or straight edge to ensure the tile isn't crooked. Some tiles may need to be cut to fit properly, using a tile cutter for ceramic or porcelain tiles and a wet saw for natural stone or thicker glass tiles. Prepare your adhesive. Natural stone mosaic tiles require a powdered thin-set mortar, while ceramic or porcelain tiles can use a mastic adhesive. Follow the instructions on the package for preparing it. When spreading the adhesive, start with a 2-foot section and spread a thin layer using a trolley at a 45-degree angle, then comb even ridges in one direction. Correct trowel size is also important; a ¼ by ¼ inch notch trowel is recommended for natural stone tile. In summary, the correct steps are to prepare the wall, layout and plan where the tiles will go, prepare the adhesive properly, and apply it in the right way, all while paying attention to safety and detail to ensure a neat and high-quality finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are some good eating joints, people said, but they don't know how to find them. Some people even told me that they sometimes go to extreme measures to avoid the neighborhood altogether. But when asked if the-v would like to see Chinatown gone, the answer was always a strong no.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\".

Given the question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet.

Question: What was distinguished about the Stamp Act from previous taxes A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not specifically address the distinction of the Stamp Act from previous taxes.  A more suitable answer would be: The Stamp Act of 1765 was distinguished from previous British taxes imposed on the American colonies because it was a direct tax enforced through the issuance of stamped paper to cover various activities and goods, such as legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. Prior to the Stamp Act, the British primarily levied indirect taxes, such as the Sugar Act, through customs and import duties. The direct nature of the Stamp Act led to widespread resentment among colonists, who opposed taxation without representation in the British Parliament. This opposition ultimately manifested in protests, boycotts, and sometimes violent encounters, such as those initiated by the Sons of Liberty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\".

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? A mother might name her newborn son Benoit.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A mother might name her newborn son Benoit\\" is true. Given the information from the provided paragraph, Benoit is a Catholic French male given name rooted in Old French, meaning \\"blessed.\\" The name corresponds to the English name, Benedict. This association implies that it is a given name predominantly chosen for boys.  As traditional gender-normative naming practices stand, parents often follow the convention of giving a male name to a boy and a female name to a girl. As such, Benoit can be a widely accepted name choice for a newborn son. Additionally, the religious context of the name suggests that Catholic families in France or other French-speaking regions may find this name particularly appealing due to their faith. Furthermore, parents who appreciate the meaning of being \\"blessed\\" might also gravitate towards this name. However, several factors may influence a mother's choice of a name for her newborn son, including religious beliefs, family traditions, personal interests, and a desire for uniqueness. Although the name Benoit is a possibility, there are countless names available for selection when naming a child. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that a mother might name her newborn son Benoit.

Drilling will resume nearly one year after BP's blowout created the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.      Noble started drilling the well four days before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20. The project was put on hold on June 12 after the U.S. placed a moratorium on exploration in waters deeper than 500 feet (152 meters).      No new deepwater permits had been issued since the moratorium was lifted in October. Regulators have been under pressure from the oil industry and some lawmakers to get drilling projects started again in the Gulf while ensuring that new safeguards are in place. That pressure increased last week as the price of oil spiked above 100 per barrel and the price of gasoline hit its highest level in two and a half years.      Environmental groups want the government to hold off on permits and force oil companies to further study the effects of drilling on fragile marine habitats.      At 6,500 feet (1,980 meters) below the surface, Noble's well is deeper than BP's blown out Macondo well. In a worst-case scenario, the company told regulators its well could spill nearly 3 million gallons (11.36 million liters) of oil per day into the Gulf. At its peak, the BP well spilled 2.6 million gallons (9.84 million liters) per day.      Noble had drilled to a depth of 13,585 feet (4,140 meters) before the moratorium and has about 5,400 feet (1,645 meters) to go.      The permit is for a \\"bypass\\" well, which allows the driller to take a slightly different path than previously expected. Drilling is expected to recommence in April.      Director Michael Bromwich said that Noble demonstrated it is capable of containing a well blowout, a key requirement for permit approval. Noble contracted with the Helix Well Containment Group to use its emergency capping stack to stop the flow of oil in case it loses control of the well.      Another emergency containment solution, offered by a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp., was announced earlier this month.      \\"We expect further deepwater permits to be approved in coming weeks and months based on the same process that led to the approval of this permit,\\" Bromwich said.      The U.S. has approved other permits for new wells, including 37 in shallow water, since the moratorium was lifted. It also has approved 22 other applications for activity on deepwater wells that were not suspended by the moratorium.      The approval comes as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar heads to the Capitol this week to defend his agency's budget request. He is expected to be pressed by lawmakers concerned with rising gasoline prices about how slowly new permits have been issued.      Sen. David Vitter, a vocal Republican critic of the slowdown in offshore drilling permits, said Monday that \\"while one deepwater permit is a start, it is by no means reason to celebrate.\\" Vitter wants 15 deepwater permits issued before he releases a hold on the nomination of President Obama's pick to head the Fish and Wildlife Service.      House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, a Republican, urged regulators to push other applications through quickly. Noble's project alone \\"will not ease the economic pain being inflicted on Gulf families.\\"      Bromwich denied that politics played a role in the timing of the announcement. He said there are eight applications currently pending for deepwater wells.      The Obama administration is seeking a 12 million increase in the former Minerals Management Service budget to hire hundreds of new oil and gas inspectors, engineers, scientists to oversee industry operations; conduct detailed engineering reviews; and more closely review oil spill response plans. Much of the money would come from higher fees and royalty rates on oil and gas companies.      ___      Associated Press Writer Dina Cappiello contributed to this story from Washington D.C. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Alright, let me explain this like you are five years old. There was a big accident with a machine called an oil rig in the ocean. This accident caused a lot of oil to spill in the water and hurt the environment and the people who live and work near there. The company who made this mistake, called BP, and some other companies are being blamed. Lots of people and businesses said they were hurt by this, so they asked the judge for help.  Now, the judge has given another company, called Noble Energy, permission to drill in the deep ocean again. This is the first time it is allowed since that big accident. Some people are still worried about the environment and want the companies to be really careful. The people who gave permission think they have good plans to keep accidents from happening again.

Please answer the following question: This article: Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the  maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... contains an answer for the question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?, what is it ?

WA family still grieves after 1996 murder The parents of one of the victims of the Claremont serial killer in Perth say time has not healed their loss 20 years after their daughter disappeared. Secretary Sarah Spiers, 18, was the first victim of the serial killer and is presumed dead, having not been seen since January 27, 1996. Her parents, Don and Carol Spiers, issued a statement via police on Friday, saying words could not describe their heartbreak. \\"It's hard not to wonder what Sarah's life, and ours, could have been had she not been taken from us,\\" they said. \\"She was so full of life and had a great love of family.\\" The parents thanked friends and family for their support, and police for keeping them well-informed about the investigation. \\"We retain confidence in the Macro investigation team to solve this case,\\" they said. The other victims were 23-year-old childcare worker Jane Rimmer, who was killed a few months after Ms Spiers disappeared, and 27-year-old lawyer Ciara Glennon, who was murdered in March 1997. Both their bodies were found later. Assistant Commissioner Michelle Fyfe said the investigation remained open and active. \\"The Macro team is applying fresh eyes, modern investigative techniques and the latest advancements in forensic technology to identify the offender or offenders,\\" she said. \\"They are committed to pursuing justice for the victims and to providing their families with some answers. \\"WA Police is optimistic these crimes can still be solved despite the passage of time.\\" She warned that public and media speculation on an active case could jeopardise the investigation and affect future prosecutions.

The largest moon of Neptune is Triton, as mentioned in the given statement.  Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell in 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of the planet Neptune itself. It is not only the largest moon orbiting Neptune but also one of the most intriguing moons in our solar system. Triton has a diameter of approximately 2,700 kilometers (1,680 miles) and is primarily composed of icy materials such as water, nitrogen, and methane, as well as some rocky materials. Its surface features consist of a mix of frozen nitrogen, water ice, and methane ice. Triton is unique among the large moons of our solar system because it has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. This is an indication that Triton may have been a captured object, possibly a former member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Neptune has a total of 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most massive. The remaining 13 moons are much smaller and were not discovered until the 20th century, using telescopic observation and data acquired from flyby missions like NASA's Voyager 2 in 1989. These smaller moons are typically irregularly shaped and have darker surfaces compared to Triton.

Does \\"The current Spanish constitution has been implemented in such a way that, in many respects, Spain can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal.\\" correctly answer the question of What type of government does Spain have?","output":"The statement does not provide a direct answer to the question, but it does offer insight that helps in understanding the type of government Spain has. To provide a more detailed and accurate answer, let's analyze the Spanish government and its resemblance to federal systems. Spain is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, where the King holds representative and ceremonial roles, and the Prime Minister is responsible for executive powers. The Parliament of Spain consists of two chambers: the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, which make up the legislative branch. Although Spain is not defined as a federal state in its constitution, it has a unique system of governance and autonomy that has some resemblances to federalism. In fact, Spain is often referred to as a \\"quasi-federal\\" country due to the level of autonomy granted to its 17 regions (called \\"autonomous communities\\"). They have their own governments, parliaments, and official languages, besides Spanish. These autonomous communities were established by the 1978 Spanish Constitution, which aimed at granting more self-rule to regions with different cultural and historic identities, like Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia. Each autonomous community has a wide range of powers and competences, such as education, transportation, health care, and taxation. Furthermore, they are allowed to have their own statutes, which serve as their regional constitutions and determine the organization and functioning of their institutions. Given this organization and decentralization of power in Spain, it bears similarities to federal systems, where power is shared between a central government and constituent political units. In addition, Spain's Senate, one of the chambers that constitute the legislative branch, is intended to represent the interests of the autonomous communities, reinforcing the federal-like structure. However, it is essential to highlight that Spain's system is not a pure federal system. Its constitution does not define the country as such, and notwithstanding the large degree of autonomy granted to the autonomous communities, the central government still holds significant power over them. In conclusion, while the statement doesn't directly answer the question about the type of government Spain has, it does offer a useful insight. Spain is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unique governance structure that exhibits some federal-like characteristics, particularly with regards to the autonomy granted to its regions. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that Spain is not officially a federal country based on its constitution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea. Answer:","output":"Northern Bald Ibis"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Answer the question below:   If people use a lot of energy they create less waste or more waste?    Assuming that:  Increased resource use generally means more waste; electronic waste from developed nations is a growing problem in the developing world. A:","output":"When people use a lot of energy, they generally create more waste. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as increased resource use, the rapid growth of electronic waste, and the need for energy production. Below are some reasons why increased energy consumption leads to more waste generation: 1. Increased resource use: When people use more energy, they are often consuming more resources, such as electricity, gas, and fuel. The production and consumption of these resources can generate waste in various forms, such as emissions from power plants, waste produced during the extraction of raw materials, and waste generated during the manufacturing process of products that use energy, like electronics and vehicles. 2. Electronic waste: The use of electronic devices, such as smartphones, computers, and televisions, has skyrocketed in recent years. This has led to a significant increase in electronic waste, which is often hazardous and can cause considerable harm to the environment and human health when not properly managed. Developed nations have been experiencing an increasing problem with electronic waste disposal, and a portion of this waste, unfortunately, ends up in developing countries where recycling facilities may be limited or non-existent. This exacerbates the waste management issues faced by these countries and contributes to environmental pollution. 3. Energy production waste: The production of energy can also generate waste. For example, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste, which requires long-term disposal in secure repositories to prevent harm to both humans and the environment. Additionally, coal-fired power plants generate significant amounts of ash and other waste products, which can contribute to air and water pollution if not managed carefully. 4. Packaging waste: A high-energy lifestyle often results in increased consumption of packaged goods. The production and consumption of these products results in a large amount of plastic and paper waste, much of which ends up in landfills or the natural environment. When people use more energy, they often generate more packaging waste because they are consuming more disposable, pre-packaged, and processed goods that come wrapped in plastic, paper, or other materials. 5. Indirect waste generation: Higher energy consumption indicates a higher level of production and consumption of goods and services. This can lead to more waste generation indirectly. For example, when people use energy-consuming devices like cars, they may be more likely to travel greater distances and purchase items that generate waste, like fast food packaging, disposable products, and single-use plastics. 6. Resource depletion: Higher energy consumption can also contribute to resource depletion, which in turn can lead to more waste as companies and individuals are forced to use less efficient or more environmentally harmful methods to extract and process necessary resources. Resource depletion also strains the planet's natural systems, which can become less effective in breaking down waste, further exacerbating waste problems. In conclusion, people who use a lot of energy generally create more waste, due to factors such as increased resource use, growing electronic waste problems, and waste generation from energy production. It is crucial that we work together to find innovative solutions for managing waste, conserving resources, and adopting more sustainable energy practices to reduce our ecological footprint and protect the environment for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fraternity settles lawsuit over fatal accident at Yale-Harvard football game A Yale University fraternity and more than 80 of its members have settled lawsuits over a fatal rental truck accident outside the popular Yale-Harvard football game in 2011, bringing an end to all litigation in the case, a lawyer said Friday. A U-Haul truck carrying beer kegs heading to the Sigma Phi Epsilon tailgating area outside the Yale Bowl fatally struck 30-year-old Nancy Barry, of Salem, Massachusetts, and injured two other women. Brendan Ross, a Yale student and fraternity member who was driving the truck, was allowed into a probation program that erased criminal charges against him. Ralph Sbrogna, a Worcester, Massachusetts, attorney representing Barry’s family, told the Associated Press that the national office of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the fraternity’s Yale chapter and the Yale fraternity members at the time of the accident were the final defendants to settle the lawsuits. The settlements were reached in November, but formal court documents have yet to be filed, he said. Terms of all the settlements were confidential, and none of the defendants admitted any wrongdoing, Sbrogna said. The fraternity and its members had been scheduled to go on trial in the case next week in state court in Waterbury. Barry’s family and Sarah Short, a Yale student injured in the accident, sued the fraternity; its members, including Ross; Yale; U-Haul; and other defendants for unspecified damages. Yale, U-Haul and other defendants had earlier settled the lawsuits, Sbrogna said. “The family is happy to have this behind them, to have some closure to this,” Sbrogna said of Barry’s relatives. “Whatever was gained from this settlement monetarily is not going to bring this young woman back.” A lawyer for the fraternity did not immediately return a message seeking comment Friday. A Yale spokesman had no immediate comment. The accident happened November 19, 2011, outside the Yale Bowl, where Harvard beat Yale 45-7 in the 128th edition of the rivalry. Ross, of O’Fallon, Missouri, revved the truck’s engine in an effort to get pedestrians to move, but the vehicle took off, state prosecutors said. Ross told police he tried to hit the brake but hit the gas pedal instead. Ross passed a field sobriety test after the accident and was charged with negligent homicide and reckless driving. He was granted accelerated rehabilitation in February 2013. The program allows charges to be erased upon successful completion of probation. He also was ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. After the accident, Yale tightened its tailgating rules. It now bans kegs at university athletic events and other functions. Also, oversized vehicles, such as box trucks and large commercial vehicles, are barred from university lots at athletic events unless they are driven by a preapproved authorized vendor.

Financial adversity forces Lord Lynton to give up the woman whom he loves with a passion, and who idolises him as a dashing soldier, and to make a marriage of convenience with the daughter of the rich but unspeakably vulgar Jonathan Chawleigh.

Article:","output":"Title: Michael Johnson, 22, Charged with Exposing Gay Lover to HIV; Police Discover 32 Sex Tapes with Unidentified Men Introduction: Michael Johnson, a 22-year-old from St. Charles, Missouri was recently charged with exposing his gay lover to HIV. The case has taken further a disturbing turn after the police discovered 32 explicit sex tapes featuring Johnson with several unidentified men. The investigation began after an individual claimed to have contracted HIV from Johnson.  Body: The emergence of the sex tapes has shed light on the many encounters Johnson had with numerous people involved in the explicit acts. The recordings were primarily made in a room at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri, according to the police. Among the tapes, 31 unidentified men can be seen engaging in sexual activity with Johnson. Since these individuals are not aware of Johnson's HIV status, the authorities are working to uncover their identities to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect public health. The investigation was prompted after a man claimed to have caught HIV from Johnson. This allegation led to a thorough search and subsequent discovery of the sex tapes, all of which are now playing a crucial role in developing the case against Johnson. As the authorities continue their efforts to identify the men involved in the tapes, the potential number of individuals exposed to HIV by Johnson raises significant concerns about the broader implications of this case. Authorities are also urging any individuals who have had sexual contact with Johnson to come forward and get tested for HIV, as well as to help in identifying other potentially affected people. Conclusion: The unfolding case of Michael Johnson, now facing charges for exposing his gay lover to HIV, highlights the importance of practicing safe sex and being informed about one's health status. Awareness and open communication about sexually transmitted infections are crucial in preventing their spread and limiting the potential impact on others. As the investigation continues, it is essential for anyone who may have been exposed to Johnson to take the necessary steps to protect their health and well-being. In summary, Michael Johnson's actions have exposed many to the risks associated with HIV. Authorities must act quickly and efficiently to identify the 31 unidentified men in the tapes to address the pressing health concerns and bring justice for those involved in this alarming case. The situation serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding one's health and practicing safe sex to protect oneself and others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is always wise to check the official government websites and stay up-to-date on any travel policy changes. When planning your solo trip to Paris, take time to craft a well-thought-out itinerary that accommodates your interests, budget, and time constraints. From iconic tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum to hidden gems such as Canal Saint-Martin and the Paris Catacombs, the City of Light offers endless opportunities for adventure and cultural experiences. Before embarking on your trip, make sure to book your flight tickets and accommodation ahead of time. Look for reputable websites and airlines offering the best deals and value for your money. When searching for accommodations, consider your desired location, convenience, and safety, particularly since you are traveling alone. Options abound, from charming boutique hotels and budget-friendly hostels to popular home-sharing platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo. It is essential to stay connected while traveling, especially when navigating an unfamiliar city. Purchase a local SIM card or activate an international roaming plan with your phone before you leave. Having access to the internet will make it easier to communicate with friends and family back home, navigate the city using public transportation or ride-sharing services, and discover Parisian experiences and events happening during your stay.

To do this, we need to subtract 4750 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 4750 = 95*k + 4750 - 4750 -4750 = 95*k Step 3: Solve for k.

Given equation: 396*h - 32935 = -52*h - 493*h We can combine the terms with h on the right side of the equation. -52*h - 493*h = (-52 - 493)*h = -545*h Now, the equation becomes: 396*h - 32935 = -545*h Step 2: Move variables (terms containing h) to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 545*h on both sides of the equation to isolate h terms on one side. 396*h + 545*h - 32935 = -545*h + 545*h Combining the h terms on the left side: (396 + 545)*h - 32935 = 0 Combining the numbers: 941*h - 32935 = 0 Step 3: Isolate h term. Now, let's move the constant term, -32935 to the right side by adding 32935 to both sides: 941*h - 32935 + 32935 = 0 + 32935 Simplifying the equation: 941*h = 32935 Step 4: Solve for h.

Does \\"In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded.\\" correctly answer the question of Where did Igor get warriors from after returning to Kiev after being drivin out by the Byzatines?","output":"No, the statement \\"In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded.\\" does not directly answer the question of where Igor got warriors from after returning to Kiev after being driven out by the Byzantines. While the statement mentions the Rus' force advancing on the Greeks again in 944, it does not specifically address the source of the warriors that Igor gathered.  To provide a more detailed and relevant answer to the question: Igor of Kiev, also known as Igor I, was a Varangian ruler of the Kievan Rus' during the 10th century. After being driven out by the Byzantines in the early 940s, Igor had to reassemble his army in order to gather enough forces for a new campaign. To obtain warriors after his initial defeat, Igor turned to several possible sources: 1. Local Slavic tribes: As the ruler of the Kievan Rus', Igor would have been able to draw upon the many Slavic tribes under his rule to replenish his army. These tribes, which included the Polans, Drevlians, Severians, and others, would have been a significant source of manpower for Igor's new military campaign. 2. Varangian mercenaries: The Varangians were an elite warrior class of Norse origin who often served as mercenaries for various rulers around the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe. It is likely that Igor, himself being a Varangian, would have been able to recruit more of these skilled fighters to bolster his forces. 3. Khazar and Pecheneg allies: Igor may have also sought military assistance from neighboring powers, such as the Khazars and Pechenegs. Both of these groups were known to have been involved in various conflicts with the Byzantines and could have seen an opportunity to weaken their common enemy by supporting Igor's new campaign. 4. Diplomacy and tribute: Some sources suggest that Igor may have engaged in diplomatic efforts to gather warriors, possibly by promising land, status or rewards to those who fought alongside his forces. Additionally, he may have demanded or negotiated for military assistance from the tribes and clans under his rule as part of their tributary obligations. Utilizing a combination of these sources, Igor was able to rebuild his army and launch another attack against the Byzantine Empire in 944. During this campaign, the Rus' force, comprised of both land and naval units, advanced on the Greek territories. In response, the Byzantines sent a force from Cherson to confront Igor's forces, ultimately concluding the conflict through negotiations and a favorable treaty for the Kievan Rus'. Nevertheless, the specific composition of Igor's forces in this campaign remains a topic of historical debate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger Movie plot: Sinbad (Patrick Wayne), sailor and Prince of Baghdad, moors at Charak, intent on seeking permission from Prince Kassim to marry Kassim's sister, Princess Farah (Jane Seymour). He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur. During the voyage, Farah proves to be the only person capable of calming the baboon. Sinbad is convinced that the baboon is Kassim after he witnesses it playing chess with Farah. Sinbad and Farah land at Casgar and find Melanthius and his daughter Dione (Taryn Power), who agree to help them. Melanthius says they must travel to the land of Hyperborea where the ancient civilization of the Arimaspi once existed. On the way to Hyperborea, Melanthius and Dione also become convinced that the baboon is Kassim. Zenobia uses a potion to transform herself into a gull to spy on Sinbad. Once aboard his ship, she turns into a miniature human and listens in as Melanthius tells Sinbad how to cure Kassim. Alerted by Kassim, Melanthius and Sinbad capture Zenobia. Unfortunately, her potion spills and a wasp ingests some of it. The wasp grows to enormous size and attacks the two... My question: Where is the alchemist?

Available options: (i) Jill's parents scolded her for skipping class. (ii) Jill's parents took her to Disney World.","output":"To determine the most likely outcome, let's examine both options: (i) Jill's parents scolded her for skipping class. Considering Jill skipped school, which is a breach of her student responsibilities and an act of disobedience, it is very likely that her parents would scold her for this behavior. Most parents would expect their child to attend school and might worry or be upset about the consequences of skipping class, thus making this option very plausible. (ii) Jill's parents took her to Disney World. This option seems highly unlikely, as taking Jill to an amusement park would not address her skipping school and could instead be seen as a reward for her misbehavior. Most parents would not take their child to Disney World as a response to them skipping class, as this would not encourage better behavior and responsibility in the future. Considering both options, the most likely outcome of the story is: Jill's parents scolded her for skipping class (option i).

In regular writing, spaces are essential components as they organize words, making it easier for readers to comprehend and distinguish separate ideas. Removing spaces can lead to confusion and a challenging reading experience, as the visual flow would be disrupted, making it difficult to identify different words quickly. This becomes especially problematic in longer texts, where spaces play a crucial role in understanding the context and meaning of sentences. Additionally, spaces contribute to the visual aspect of text layout, providing a comfortable structure for the reader's eyes to follow. Removing spaces minimizes the white space on the page, cluttering the text and ultimately reducing the overall appearance of the passage.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person who took photos of Arnett's bloodied face?  American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. look twice and jump around left thrice A:","output":"1. I_LOOK: The command 'look twice' requires the agent to look twice, so the first action is I_LOOK. 2. I_LOOK: Repeating the action for the 'twice' scope, the agent looks again. 3.

I_TURN_LEFT: Continuing the turn 'around left', the agent turns left once more, completing a 180-degree turn. 6. I_JUMP: Repeating the jump for the 'thrice' scope, the agent jumps again. 7.

Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces, yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied Vladivostok, previously held by the Provisional Priamur Government. The last enclave of the White Forces was the Ayano-Maysky District on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and the final resistance of the White movement in the Far East).","output":"The given context does not provide any information about the Union of Working Peasants, so it is not possible to extract the answer to the question from the provided text."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Take a look outside and watch Jupiter and moon meet up The bright planet Jupiter will shine near the moon on Wednesday night and could dazzle skywatchers with clear night skies. This view shows how Jupiter and the moon will appear in the eastern night sky on Dec. 18 at 8 pm local time for observers in midnorthern latitudes. Step outside Wednesday evening and look to the east-northeast sky for a surprising celestial sight. If you're outside around 6:30 p.m. EST and weather permits, the first striking view you might get is the moon. It will be one night past full phase, but look more closely and shining prominently to the moon’s left will be a dazzling silvery-white, non-twinkling “star.” As the evening wears on, both the moon and its brilliant companion will appear to ascend the sky side by side. This cosmic companion is not a star, but the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter. [Amazing Night Sky Photos of December 2013 (Skywatcher Images)] Jupiter currently blazes at negative 2.7 magnitude, meaning that it is three times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. You can make a comparison between the two once Sirius rises above the southeast horizon just before 8 p.m. local time. To find the star, just extend a line from the constellation Orion’s belt down and to the left and you’ll come to Sirius. It looks quite different from Jupiter. It appears to shine with a bluish-white tint compared to the sedate whiteness of Jupiter. Right now, Jupiter rises around the end of twilight. By the end of December it will gleam low in the east-northeast sky as twilight fades, second only to Venus in brilliance. Jupiter climbs the eastern sky all evening, shines high in the southern sky in the middle of the night, and is low in the west at dawn. Jupiter will come to opposition on the evening of Jan. 5, when it will also be nearest to the Earth at 391.4 million miles (629.8 million kilometers) away. In fact, Jupiter will be exactly opposite to the sun in our sky. Any hypothetical observer stationed at the giant planet would see the tiny black dot of the Earth cross in front of (or transit) the small disk of the sun, according to Belgian astronomer Jean Meeus. The giant planet is a splendid sight in any telescope. Its disk is striped with prominent dark belts and light zones that are sometimes (in a good telescope) filled with detail. When looking at the gas giant through a telescope observers will also be able to view some or all of the famous Galilean moons — Europa, Io, Callisto and Ganymede. To see those moons, however, it might be best to wait until about 9 p.m. when Jupiter has climbed at least one-third of the way up from the horizon to the point directly overhead. Moreover, Jupiter is near the northernmost part of the ecliptic (it appears in the constellation Gemini, the twins), so observers at midnorthern latitudes see it cross the meridian at a good high altitude and well above the atmospheric turbulence experienced at lower altitudes.

Most of the dining room staff are from India, and provide service with a warmth that many other nationals find hard to equal. Wine service is amateurish and the lack of knowledge is lamentable. Extra-cost restaurants with menus designed by some of Britain’s well-known television celebrity chefs, such as Gary Rhodes and Marco Pierre-White, have been introduced. They are a mix of trendy bistro-style venues, and restaurants with an Asia-Pacific theme. The self-serve buffets suffer from small, cramped facilities, and passengers complain of having to share them with the countless concession staff who take over tables and congregate in groups. In other words, the buffets are too small to accommodate the needs of most passengers today. Regular coffee: Weak, and poor. Score: 3 out of 10. 10. Good quality tea and coffee-making set-up is provided in all cabins. Self-serve beverage stations are provided at the buffets, but it’s often difficult to find proper teaspoons – often only wooden stirrers are available. Espresso/cappuccino coffees in the extra-charge venues are slightly better, but not as good as aboard the ships of Costa Cruises or MSC Cruises, for example.

Mercury News blasted for insensitive Simone Manuel headline At first glance, San Jose Mercury News readers might’ve thought that Michael Phelps and Simone Manuel watched the moon landing together Thursday night. The California news outlet’s first pass at a headline for Thursday night’s action in the pool — Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night with African-American — was widely panned for being racially insensitive. While it was a historic night for Manuel — who became the firstblack American woman to win an individual gold medal in swimming, finishing tied for first with Canada’s Penny Oleksiak in the 100-meter freestyle — and for Phelps, the wording simply didn’t work and social media wasted little time in blasting the Mercury News for it. Its second try 10 minutes later was better, but still included a gaffe — Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night Stanford’s Simone Manuel. History! Simone Manuel wins swimming gold, takes 100 freestyle The third time was the charm, as The Merc went with “Olympics: Stanford’s Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps make history.” The editors also decided to tweet out an apology for the earlier insensitive headline and included an editor’s note right at the top of the story: The original headline on this story was insensitive and has been updated to acknowledge the historic gold medal wins by both Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps. We apologize for the original headline. The story has also been updated. Confused broadcaster says Lochte, not Phelps, wins 200m medley Still, that wasn’t enough for some readers — and non-readers who were just piling on on Twitter — Friday morning, with more than a few calling the apology and editor’s note “unacceptable” and “bulls--t.” In a time where headline writers are at the mercy of Google’s search algorithms, it’s possible that whoever was writing the headline was thinking about keywords — history, Olympics, Michael Phelps, African American — and just jammed them all together. But you’ve still got to read the headline back and think Does this make sense? What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses the backlash against the San Jose Mercury News for their racially insensitive headlines about Olympic swimmers Michael Phelps and Simone Manuel in 2016. Simone Manuel became the first Black American woman to win an individual gold medal in swimming, and Michael Phelps won his 22nd career Olympic gold at that time. The San Jose Mercury News published a headline that read: \\"Olympics: Michael Phelps shares historic night with African-American.\\" This led to an uproar on social media, with many users accusing the outlet of pointing out Simone Manuel's race in a demeaning way and not giving her equal recognition as Michael Phelps. The paper subsequently modified the headline two times before settling on, \\"Olympics: Stanford’s Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps make history.\\"  The editors of the San Jose Mercury News issued an apology and included a banner at the top of the article acknowledging their mistake.

Article: BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy.        Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines.        In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books.        Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources.        Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market.        The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant  regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors.       Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has  _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world.

Available choices: a). no b). yes","output":"a). No While both questions focus on the general topic of earning money, they address different aspects, goals, and outcomes. 1) \\"How can one become part of the 1%?\\"  This question asks about the process by which an individual might join the top 1% of wealthy people. This goal extends beyond simply making a living and implies striving for a significant accumulation of financial resources. The top 1% represents a small, elite group of people who have amassed substantial wealth, often through various means such as investments, entrepreneurship, or inheritance.  In order to become part of the 1%, one would most likely need to pursue high-paying career opportunities, invest wisely, take calculated risks, build a successful business, or inherit a considerable amount of wealth. Networking with influential individuals, continuously improving one's skillset, and being vigilant for lucrative opportunities also play a role in reaching the top 1%. However, this question does not focus on sustaining a living in a specific country like the United States but centers on the broader concept of financial success. 2) \\"How do I make money to support my living in the U.S.?\\" In contrast, this question is more focused on achieving financial stability to cover the cost of living in the United States. Making money to support one's living in the U.S. does not necessarily require accumulating a substantial wealth comparable to that of the 1%, but rather, earning enough income to comfortably cover expenses such as housing, food, transportation, and leisure activities.  To make money and support your living in the U.S., you would need to secure employment or engage in other income-generating activities that align with your skills, education, and interests. These could include working full-time or part-time, freelancing, developing passive income sources, or even starting a small business. Budgeting, managing personal finances, and saving for emergencies are essential practices that can contribute to financial stability in the United States. In summary, although both questions revolve around the theme of financial security, they are not the same. The first question deals with the pursuit of significant wealth to become part of the top 1%, while the second question focuses on establishing a stable income to support life in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale.

Question: In what decade could one find an \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada? Answer: A fake \\"English looking\\" pub trend started in the 1990s, built into existing storefronts, like regular bars.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choices: --yes; --no;","output":"--yes; The \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada emerged during the 1990s. This was a time when themed pubs and bars gained popularity, and business owners sought to recreate the cozy and authentic atmosphere found in traditional British pubs. These establishments were designed to evoke the charm and ambience of England, often featuring dark wood interiors, plush seating, vintage lighting, and an extensive selection of beers and ales on tap. Aspects such as British memorabilia, dartboards, and fireplaces were also common elements in these Canadian pubs. The appeal of the \\"English looking\\" pub in Canada during the 1990s can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the British pub culture has long been associated with a sense of warmth and conviviality – something that was particularly appealing during a time when social spaces were undergoing rapid changes due to globalization and technological advancements. Canadian bar-goers were drawn to the allure of a traditional pub experience, where they could relax and enjoy the company of friends and family in a more nostalgic setting. Secondly, there was a growth in tourism between Canada and the United Kingdom during the 1990s. As a result, many Canadians had the opportunity to experience British pub culture first-hand and developed a taste for the unique atmosphere and culinary offerings that these establishments provided. Bringing this concept back to Canada allowed them to continue to enjoy the unique English pub experience on their home turf. Thirdly, the 1990s were marked by a resurgence of interest in craft beer, particularly among younger generations. The British pub concept was a natural fit for this growing trend, as English and Irish ales played a significant role in the history of beer brewing. Consequently, English-style pubs in Canada began to offer a wide variety of imported and local craft beers alongside traditional British beverages, such as cask ales and stouts. As the trend continued to grow in popularity, many Canadian cities saw an increase in the number of English-themed pubs. For instance, Toronto saw the opening of establishments like The Queen and Beaver Public House and The Oxley, both of which were designed to resemble classic British pubs. Other major cities, such as Vancouver and Montreal, also experienced a rise in English-style pubs, with businesses like The Irish Heather and Burgundy Lion catering to the growing demand for an authentic British pub experience during the 1990s. In summary, the \\"English looking\\" pub trend in Canada became prominent during the 1990s. During this time, these establishments emerged as popular social spaces, thanks in part to a renewed fascination with British pub culture, increased international travel, and a growing interest in craft beer. As a result, many Canadian cities saw a boom in the number of pubs designed to resemble their English counterparts, providing patrons with a unique and nostalgic atmosphere in which to drink, dine, and socialize."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What actor plays the role of Nikki? Title: Spread Movie plot: The Spread world premiere has been announced for Saturday, January 17 at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.Set in modern day Los Angeles, Spread is a hard biting story about a high-end lothario, Nikki (Ashton Kutcher), who has slept his way into a life of privilege. He shares his secrets with us as he hosts parties and beds scores of women, all while living it up at the Hollywood Hills home of a middle-aged female attorney, Samantha (Anne Heche). Everything is going swimmingly until Nikki meets a gorgeous waitress named Heather (Margarita Levieva), who, unbeknownst to him, is playing the same game that he is. As the truth of their life unravels, they find themselves sexually charged by a game of one-upmanship that has them dining at fine restaurants and crashing posh parties, until the truth of their lives forces them to choose between love and money. Inspired by classics like Shampoo, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and American Gigolo, Spread profiles a sexual grifter and his prey.Los Angeles serves as a character unto its own in this film, providing slick and luxurious backdrops during Nikki's high times, and seedy, fleabag motels when Nikki has nowhere else to turn. Nikki runs the gambit of Hollywood dreams and nightmares. The supporting cast comprises gorgeous women like Emily (Rachel Blanchard), who is drawn in by Nikki's good looks and charm but is left feeling cold and used. Nikki's best friend, Harry (Sebastian Stan), struggles with their co-dependant relationship, always needing to bail Nikki out when he runs out of women to depend on.Directed by David Mackenzie (Hallam Foe, Young Adam), Spread is an iconic look at the lure of sex, money, and access that Hollywood offers to the beautiful people, and the karmic price that Nikki must ultimately pay to live that lifestyle.

Title: Monty Python and the Holy Grail Movie plot: The credits are rolled to deeply ominous music with several false starts, interlaced with apologies for the inadequacies of each, during which numerous titlers are fired en masse. In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horsea sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grassis heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics. Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding off.The scene changes to a plague village. A cart is being drawn through the streets, and is attended by a disheveled man (Eric Idle) who strikes a triangle and calls for the residents to \\"bring out your dead.\\" A peasant (John Cleese) tries to lay a decrepit man on the cart, without calling attention to the fact that he is still alive.
