Один из твоих учеников выдал тебе сочинение по роману отцы и дети. Раскритикуй сочинение и поставь оценку: \\"Поверхностный анализ Базарова не выявляет сильно положительных качеств. Хотя он и умён, Евгений отрицает любовь, красоту природы и эмоции человека, всвязи с этим он считает гумманитарные науки бессмысленными. Евгений мало к кому проявляет уважение, предпочитая судить и насмеиваться над теми, кого недолюбливает. Тем не менее, именно его ясный ум и отрицание общепринятых норм заставляют задуматься о многих вещах глубже. Нельзя отрицать, что в основе его сухого рационализма лежала жажда истины, а его пренебрежение к искусствам и поезии порождалось стремлением к прогрессу и практическому применению знаний. В этом есть определённое величие: Базаров верен своим убеждениям и готов защищать их, пусть даже это делает его обособленным от общества. Базаров презирает любовь как эмоциональное чувство, но, несмотря на это, он сам стал жертвой этой всепоглощающей страсти, которая так жестоко разыгралась с ним, когда он встретил Одинцову. Здесь он показывает себя не таким уверенным и рациональным, сколько хотел бы казаться. Его внезапный порыв и неспособность контролировать свои чувства выставляют его слабостью, которую он так старался скрыть. Это делает Базарова более человечным и позволяет читателю лучше понять сложность его характера. Смерть Базарова ещё больше демонстрирует его человеческую сторону; его столкновение с собственной смертностью и принятие неизбежного конца противопоставляют его нигилистическим убеждениям. Этот переход от отрицания к примирению с судьбой — важный момент в развитии его характера и подчёркивание того, что в конечном итоге чувства и эмоции являются неизбежной частью человеческого опыта. В заключительной части можно отметить, что читатель может искренне любить Базарова за его ум и целеустремлённость, а также за его способность вызвать сомнения и переосмысление традиционных ценностей. Однако, его цинизм, отсутствие сочувствия и эмпатии, а также недооценка чувств и романтизма вызывают неприятие и даже осуждение. Его трагедия не в том, что он ошибался, а в том, что был слишком ограничен, чтобы в полной мере принять многогранность жизни. Базаров остаётся важной и противоречивой фигурой, как в контексте русской литературы, так и в более широком смысле философской мысли о природе человека и общества.\\"","output":"Сочинение ученика по роману \\"Отцы и дети\\" представляет попытку анализа характера главного героя, Евгения Базарова, его убеждений и эволюции как личности. При критике сочинения следует учитывать содержание, объем анализа, соблюдение литературных норм и степень оригинальности мысли. Ниже представлена оценка и критика сочинения: 1. Содержание и глубина анализа: Сочинение касается разных аспектов характера Базарова, включая его интеллект, нигилистические взгляды, отношение к науке, искусству и эмоциям. Ученик также рассматривает изменения в поведении Базарова при встрече с Одинцовой и его конфронтацию со смертью. Обсуждение чувственной стороны героя и его борьбы со стереотипами демонстрирует хорошее понимание текста и способность к критическому мышлению. Однако для повышения оценки стоило бы более детально раскрыть причины противоположных черт его характера и привести больше примеров из текста, подкрепляющих аргументы. 2. Структура и связность текста: Сочинение имеет логическую структуру с введением, основной частью, заключением. Автор делает переходы между различными аспектами характера Базарова и поддерживает целостность рассуждения. Однако можно добавить связующие фразы для более плавного перехода между абзацами. 3. Соблюдение языковых норм: Текст хорошо написан, без ярких грамматических и стилистических ошибок. Словарный запас и фразеология соответствуют уровню серьезного литературного анализа. 4. Оригинальность: Сочинение демонстрирует личную интерпретацию ученика, хоть и основывается на известных аналитических подходах к роману. Элемент оригинальности требует большего развития, указание на менее очевидные связи или более уникальный угол зрения на материал. Оценка: Сочинение может быть оценено примерно на \\"4\\" (хорошо), так как оно продемонстрировало глубокое понимание материала и способность к анализу, хотя для достижения \\"5\\" (отлично) необходимо более развернутое обсуждение и широкое использование текста романа для подтверждения аргументов. Стоит также обратить внимание на более креативное и нестандартное осмысление персонажа, что может выделить его работу среди других."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

D. Saunders (2001)— Here in our precious homeland, we always see the twentieth century as providing the backdrop for our great national trauma. Some may say we deserved everything we got for our legacy of exploitation and prejudice, yet others would argue that we learned only that some things are worse than division. But, though we must always be careful to keep our national perspective and hold on to our fragile identity, we must remember that there is more to the twentieth century than that. Mother Carolina is not unique in seeing that century as a theatre of trauma and distress, even if her people suffered more than most. The pieces did not move on the world chessboard out of some narrative desire to ruin our lives, but as the consequences of natural events and choices made by men. And women, for in this century women began to take their place as equals on the world stage. Both we and our estranged brethren in the ENA have a tendency to place ourselves at the centre of the conflicts that ravaged the world in that century, whether through war, disease or cultural devastation. But we cannot truly understand them unless we look at events in the wider world. Though much of this book is devoted to our own struggles, we must look beyond to find the causes of the Black Twenties. The end of the Pandoric War had produced both winners and losers. As we will cover in great detail elsewhere, Carolina was certainly one of the latter, though her people could not have dreamed that far worse than indecisive American occupation was yet to come. The fates of many nations were ambiguous. China had emerged victorious on all fronts, the atavistic Beiqing remnant destroyed and a reunited empire ready to exert itself on the world stage—yet the new Huifu Emperor spent much of the First Interbellum Period resolving the country’s internal contradictions and recovering from disasters, little dreaming that they would soon be overshadowed by worse. The ENA might have been victorious over Carolina and subordinates half of old New Spain, but she had seen reversals against the Russians in the North West and had finally lost the mother country of Britain to revolt and revolution. Emperor George IV had abdicated in favour of his son Augustus, and though the Social American programmes of President Faulkner would change the American people’s quality of life, it was hard to see America as a victorious nation. Germany, Danubia, the Ottoman Empire and Belgium had all been weakened by the conflict. Russia, despite her reversals in China, seemed otherwise the clearest victor of the conflict, with wins against both the ENA and the German-Danubian Pressburg Pact. Yet it was France, who had led the Marseilles Protocol alliance of armed neutrality, that emerged as the world’s premier power without becoming directly involved in the war. Even her old enemy of Britain was now part of her alliance. Grumblings of her policy being that of a ‘vulture’ aside, with her rivals weakened it seemed as though the twentieth century might be a French century. Yet as every schoolchild knows, it was a paper victory. Only a handful of years later, France’s pre-eminence would be threatened by her failed intervention in South America. The UPSA had seemed the most definitive loser of the war, and in any meaningful sense she had been; yet though the nation was murdered, its people went on, like a shambling zambee corpse bereft of a soul. The Alfarus regime brutally but effectively led the new Societist Combine to drive France from the shores of the former UPSA, unite a continent under the black flag and the Threefold Eye, and then spread its destructive message to distant shores. Yet, throughout the First Interbellum, few recognised the threat that the seductive message of Sanchezism represented, or the cultural self-harm that former Meridians were suffering in their alphanumerically redesignated homeland. Instead, nations turned inwards and revelled in peace and prosperity, with the rise of the Flippant movement; politics was neglected, as we know all too well from the endless debates over our own occupied country’s fate which went nowhere. Such Flippant debauchery was brought to a rude end by the Panic of 1917 and the ensuing global financial collapse. The five years between the Panic and the start of the open conflict phase of the Black Twenties are crucial for drawing up the battle lines. France and Russia, as the two most financially stable powers of the Old World, had built new alliances and reinforced old ones by means of bailing out the less fortunate nations. Sometimes those alliances might be firm, as in the longstanding attachment of successive francophile Italian governments to Paris, or the brutal suppression of Belgian protests by Russian troops in 1918 which rendered Charles Theodore III as nothing more than a puppet of Petrograd. Others were considerably shakier. The French governments of Mercier (m), Rouillard and ultimately Cazeneuve attempted to build an alliance aimed at containing Russian expansion. This is sometimes described as the ‘Bouclier’ (shield), but in truth this was a propaganda term only applied to alliances in Europe, in particular those with Germany; as Marshal Picotin observed, the shielding in question was between France proper and the hypothetical hordes of lightning-fast Russian armarts. A more general term thrown around in theoretical French foreign policy circles was Cannes Mondiale or ‘Worldwide Cannae’, drawing comparisons with Hannibal of Carthage’s successful victory in surrounding and annihilating a Roman army at the titular battle. Similarly, France sought to surround Russia, though the second part of the Cannae comparison only lent weight to Russian propaganda which portrayed the French as aggressors bent on world domination, that Russian culture and freedom was under threat.[3] The idea of an inevitable confrontation between France and Russia, in modern renditions of history tinged with hindsight, is frequently influenced by the 1919 publication The Dream of Rome by the rakish Bavarian academic Hubert de Pfeffel. De Pfeffel created a historiographic vision of European history since the first separation of the unitary Roman Empire, in which he argued that the final heirs to the Emperors of the West and East were the Kingdom of France and the Empire of All Russias. Like a number of European historians of the period, he was undoubtedly influenced by an influx of Chinese writings as China slightly opened up further towards Europe and the Novamund; many Chinese scholars had suggested a comparable model in that China might go through long periods of division, but would always inevitably reunite into a single empire as its natural and default state. De Pfeffel traced descent from Charlemagne being crowned Emperor of the West by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, then dismissed the derivative Holy Roman Empire as a dead-end of history, arguing that French history represented a truer descent from the Roman past. He pointed out that the Romans themselves had frequently passed down the imperium via adopted sons rather than blood descent, arguing that actions—such as the successful unification of France and her growing influence on surrounding nations like a new Carolingian empire—spoke louder than the mere legalities of direct descent. Russia was far easier to fit into his model, as the Tsars had openly claimed the succession of Byzantium (the Empire of the East) since the fifteenth century, and proclaimed Russia as the Third Rome. De Pfeffel’s argument, doubtless influenced by the Chinese scholars, was that Europe had slowly but steadily travelled a path back from division to an Empire of the West and an Empire of the East, led by two nations that had never strictly fought a war. Now the two blocs would clash to decide who would be the last victorious Caesar, uniting Europe under the rule of either Paris or Petrograd. He even envisaged a future in which that victor would eventually move the capital back to Rome, and the more than a millennium of division would be seen as a mere passing crisis, a blip in the history of the eternal Rome. Colourful and imaginative though de Pfeffel’s vision was, it had very little to do with French or Russian foreign policy at the time. A moment’s reflection should make it obvious that, quite apart from anything else, it came far too late to possibly influence anything significant. Rather, de Pfeffel was himself reflecting ongoing events and attempting to fit them to his theory. If any grand geopolitical theory can be said to have influenced French foreign policy, it is instead Hendrik Wiegel’s Crossroads of History in 1907, in which he portrayed any power that possessed the ‘Core’ of the Old World would eventually grow to dominate it.[4] Ultimately, the Cannae Mondiale suffered from the sheer number of nations on the frontiers of Russia (or the Vitebsk Union) and France having varying levels of relations with those neighbours. France’s firmest alliances, like those with Italy, were also the ones least relevant to such frontiers (likely not a coincidence, as powers like Danubia had little incentive to invite a new conflict). While firm alliances grew with Scandinavia and Persia, that with Germany proved shakier than expected, and bad blood over Algiers continued to undermine French approaches to the Ottoman Empire. India remained too debatable a region, with de jure control often bearing no resemblance to the lines on a map; the Russian control of Pendzhab [Punjab] had already caught many observers offguard. A real coup of French foreign policy did come with the Treaty of Bermuda in 1920, signed by the Cazeneuve government but based on negotiations by the Tuilleries under Rouillard, which led to rapproachment between Paris and Fredericksburg. As well as defusing tensions over the British Isles, this ensured that the two great powers would face their mutual enemy of Russia in a coordinated fashion. But the keystone of French policy, building over years and even before the Panic of 1917, was China. Feng China had proved it could beat the Russians during the Pandoric War, even as most other fronts had given way before them. And the Russians still sat on large territories claimed by Hanjing, whether lands they had persuaded away from their Beiqing puppet or pre-emptively occupied when that puppet had finally been disposed of by the Feng invasion. Impressed French and allied observers noted that China’s successes had come in part because her soldiers had already knocked Siam out of that war, albeit at the cost of great loss of life. The Siamese had lost much of Tonkin to the Chinese in the war, and the French were concerned that Ayutthaya[5] would forge an alliance with Petrograd for a concerted attack on China to get it back. From France’s perspective, the top priority was to give China a clear run at Russia’s Far Eastern possessions without the distraction of a Siamese revanche. To that end, the Tuilleries focused on attempting to force a lasting peaceful settlement, resulting in the Treaty of Guiling in 1919 which normalised Sino-Siamese relations with some border adjustments.[6] This certainly puts the lie to those who claim that conflicts based on national self-interest are inevitable and that they cannot be peacefully resolved without committing cultural suicide! This, then, was France’s imperfect Cannae Mondiale, further punctured by Belgium’s new ‘alliance’ with Russia and both nations being able to base forces around the world in their colonies. By the start of the 1920s, a Franco-Russian war was widely seen as inevitable, but the precise casus belli was less clear. Indeed, it could have occurred in India or Africa. But instead, it came in a place closer to home for Russia, a place which many Russians saw as their country’s natural sphere of influence. If the Tartar peoples were revolting against the Vitebsk Union, clearly it could only be the result of interference by the nefarious French and their lickspittle allies. Uprisings were triggered by the ‘Azrat Incident’ of an attack on a Russian armart convoy using traded German Firefist weapons, followed by the assassination of the Governor-General in Samarkand. The Russians issued an ultimatum, not only against the revolting khanates but against Khiva, recognised as part of the Persian sphere of influence. There was a brief period of hesitation at the Tuilleries, in which Cazeneuve considered merely providing the Persians with more modern French aerocraft (and perhaps pilots) to counter Russian terror raids on Khiva, but he decided further escalation was necessary. Even as French Vultur dromes shot down Russian bombers over Khiva, French diplomats were at work around the world, calling in their favours, coordinating with the equally war-ready President Fouracre in America, and, of course, the government of China... [3] It’s not brought up here, but the reason why the French don’t go for ‘disease containment’ analogies like cordon sanitaire is that they are regarded as having been discredited by the failure of the anti-German unification ‘Isolationsgebiet’ in the mid-nineteenth century. [4] See Part #261 in Volume VII; this is similar to the ‘World Island’ theory of OTL. [5] Used here to mean Ayutthaya the city, the capital of the Siamese Empire, i.e. in a metonymic sense like ‘Paris’ or ‘Petrograd’.

Throughout this era, women gained prominence and national identities were tested. As the world struggled with warfare, disease, and cultural devastation, many nations suffered. During the Pandoric War, Carolina was among the losers, unprepared for the challenges that would follow. China, emerging victorious, spent the interwar period healing its wounds, unaware of future turmoil. In the ENA, despite some successes, setbacks against Russia and revolutions in Britain showcased their struggles. France, not directly engaged in the war, surprisingly emerged as a leading global power, positioned to dominate the century. However, their advantage was short-lived, as their influence was challenged in South America. The Societist Combine, led by the Alfarus regime, would reject their intervention and spread Sanchezism internationally. During the peace, nations indulged in frivolity, neglecting the lurking danger of financial instability and ignoring the distress of former Meridians under a new cultural regime. The financial Panic of 1917 exposed the fragile global economic system, leading to a reshaping of alliances in anticipation of conflict. France sought to contain Russian expansion through strategic partnerships, a concept some called the \\"Cannae Mondiale,\\" which planned to encircle Russia, much like a historical Roman battle. However, this grand strategy, romanticized by theorists like Hubert de Pfeffel, didn't truly reflect the actual foreign policies of France and Russia. Ultimately, the French-led alliance was imperfect, with some members having uncertain loyalties. The impending Franco-Russian war had many potential flashpoints, but the Tartar uprisings against Russian rule became the catalyst. An assault on a Russian convoy in Central Asia, followed by an assassination, led to Russian ultimatums against neighboring regions, forcing France to escalate its involvement. French foreign policy focused on supporting China and ensuring peace with Siam, aiming to maintain stability. As tensions rose, global diplomacy intensified, with French actions, especially in Persia, signaling the start of an unavoidable major conflict."},{"instruction":"Meaning of supposed/hypotetical or maybe medieval latin word \\"mariscellus\\"","output":"The term \\"mariscellus\\" does not find a clear translation or specific meaning in Latin, medieval or otherwise.

However, there are several issues and missing details that need to be addressed: 1. The use of \`time.time()\`, \`user.headers\`, \`genSignature\`, \`recv_window\`, \`user.url_bybit_trade\`, and the \`requests\` module assumes these are imported or defined elsewhere in the code, as they are not defined within the function. 2. The \`Info\` parameter is not used within the function. If it's not necessary for the functionality, you might want to remove it. 3. The update on \`user.headers\` with \`'X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP'\` and \`'X-BAPI-SIGN'\` indicates that this is being used with an API that requires a signed request; the exactly mechanism for generating the signature (\`genSignature\`) would need to be correctly implemented and based on the specific API's requirements. 4. This function assumes \`method\` will either be \\"POST\\" or not. For methods like \\"GET,\\" the payload is appended to the URL as query parameters, while for \\"POST,\\" it is sent in the body of the request. 5. Error handling is not present in the function, so it won't handle cases where the request fails for any reason (e.g., network error, invalid endpoint, etc.). 6. Your use of \`reduce\` at the end is not clear in this context, as \`reduce\` is typically used to apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value. Here's a revised version of the function with corrections and improvements: \`\`\`python import requests import time def generate_signature(timestamp, payload, recv_window): # Example function to generate signature based on timestamp, payload, and recv_window # The actual implementation depends on the API's requirements. # TODO: Implement the signature generation logic. return \\"signature_placeholder\\" def HTTP_Request(base_url, api_key, sec_key, endPoint, method, payload): timestamp = str(int(time.time() * 10 ** 3)) recv_window = 5000 # This value should be defined as per the API's requirements. headers = { 'X-BAPI-API-KEY': api_key, 'X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP': timestamp, 'X-BAPI-SIGN': generate_signature(timestamp, payload, recv_window) } url_with_endpoint = base_url + endPoint try: session = requests.Session() session.headers.update(headers) if method == \\"POST\\": response = session.post(url_with_endpoint, data=payload) else: response = session.get(url_with_endpoint, params=payload) return response.json() except requests.RequestException as e: return {'error': str(e)} # Usage example # You will need to replace 'base_url', 'api_key', 'sec_key', and other parameters with your actual values. response = HTTP_Request( base_url='https://api.bybit.com', api_key='your_api_key', sec_key='your_secret_key', endPoint='/v2/private/order/create', method='POST', payload={'symbol': 'BTCUSD', 'order_type': 'Limit', 'qty': 1, 'price': 10000, 'side': 'Buy'} ) print(response) \`\`\` Please note that error handling is included, and certain assumptions have been made based on your initial code's context. You must replace placeholder values like 'base_url', 'api_key', 'sec_key', and any other parameters with the actual data that your specific API requires. Additionally, the \`generate_signature()\` function has to be fully fleshed out based on the API's documentation on how signatures should be created for authorized requests."},{"instruction":"cons of rational choice theory","output":"1. Limited scope: Critics argue that rational choice theory only focuses on the individual level of analysis and ignores larger social, cultural, and structural factors that may influence decision making. This narrow focus limits its ability to explain complex social phenomena. 2. Unrealistic assumptions: Rational choice theory assumes that individuals are perfectly rational, have complete and accurate information, and always act in their best self-interest. These assumptions may not hold in real-world situations, as people often make decisions based on limited information, emotions, and other non-rational considerations. 3. Neglects social influence: Rational choice theory often overlooks the role of social influence and the impact of social norms, values, and institutions on decision making. Individuals are seen as autonomous actors, disregarding the influence of others and the broader social context. 4. Ignores non-utilitarian motivations: The theory assumes that individuals are primarily motivated by self-interest and utility maximization. However, people often make choices based on other values, such as altruism, fairness, and moral principles, which are not accounted for in rational choice theory. 5. Inability to explain counterintuitive behavior: Rational choice theory struggles to explain counterintuitive behavior, where individuals make choices that are seemingly against their self-interest or not in line with rational calculations. This includes instances of cooperation, trust, and altruism, which are not easily explained by the theory's assumptions. 6. Poor predictive power: Critics argue that rational choice theory has limited predictive power because it relies on simplifying assumptions that do not accurately reflect human decision making in the real world. This undermines the theory's ability to explain and predict actual human behavior."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mogą napotykać wiele różnych problemów, niektóre z najczęstszych to: 1. Skomplikowane relacje między członkami rodziny: W rodzinach patchworkowych można napotkać trudności związane z integracją nowego partnera i jego dzieci w istniejącą rodzinę. Członkowie rodziny mogą mieć trudności z budowaniem relacji, rozwijaniem zaufania i akceptacją nowych członków. 2. Konflikty między rodzeństwem: Jeśli w rodzinach patchworkowych są dzieci z różnych związków, mogą występować różnice wieku, temperamentu i sposobu wychowania, które mogą prowadzić do konfliktów między rodzeństwem. Trudności z budowaniem więzi między dziećmi i przyjaciółmi również mogą się pojawić. 3. Finanse i problemy administracyjne: Rodziny patchworkowe często stykają się z trudnościami finansowymi, zwłaszcza w przypadku, gdy jedno z rodziców płaci alimenty lub utrzymuje dzieci z poprzedniego związku. Ponadto, regulacje dotyczące opieki nad dziećmi i prawne rozwiązania mogą być skomplikowane i wymagać dodatkowego wysiłku. 4. Problemy emocjonalne: Dzieci w rodzinach patchworkowych mogą borykać się z emocjonalnymi trudnościami, takimi jak żałoba po rozwodzie rodziców, poczucie utraty, niechęć wobec nowego partnera i inne problemy związane z dostosowaniem się do nowej sytuacji rodzinnej. 5. Wyrażanie miłości i uwagi: Członkowie rodziny patchworkowej mogą mieć trudności z wyrażaniem miłości i uwagi, zwłaszcza jeśli dziecko odczuwa zazdrość lub niepewność w nowej konfiguracji rodzinnej. Warto pamiętać, że każda rodzina jest inna i może napotykać swoje unikalne wyzwania.

But new support for the value of fiction is arriving from an unexpected quarter: neuroscience. Brain scans are revealing what happens in our heads when we read a detailed description, an evocative metaphor or an emotional exchange between characters. Stories, this research is showing, stimulate the brain and even change how we act in life. Researchers have long known that the “classical” language regions, like Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area, are involved in how the brain interprets written words. What scientists have come to realize in the last few years is that narratives activate many other parts of our brains as well, suggesting why the experience of reading can feel so alive. Words like “lavender,” “cinnamon” and “soap,” for example, elicit a response not only from the language-processing areas of our brains, but also those devoted to dealing with smells. In a 2006 study published in the journal NeuroImage, researchers in Spain asked participants to read words with strong odor associations, along with neutral words, while their brains were being scanned by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. When subjects looked at the Spanish words for “perfume” and “coffee,” their primary olfactory cortex lit up; when they saw the words that mean “chair” and “key,” this region remained dark. The way the brain handles metaphors has also received extensive study; some scientists have contended that figures of speech like “a rough day” are so familiar that they are treated simply as words and no more. Last month, however, a team of researchers from Emory University reported in Brain and Language that when subjects in their laboratory read a metaphor involving texture, the sensory cortex, responsible for perceiving texture through touch, became active. Metaphors like “The singer had a velvet voice” and “He had leathery hands” roused the sensory cortex, while phrases matched for meaning, like “The singer had a pleasing voice” and “He had strong hands,” did not. . . . The brain, it seems, does not make much of a distinction between reading about an experience and encountering it in real life; in each case, the same neurological regions are stimulated. . . . Fiction—with its redolent details, imaginative metaphors and attentive descriptions of people and their actions—offers an especially rich replica. Indeed, in one respect novels go beyond simulating reality to give readers an experience unavailable off the page: the opportunity to enter fully into other people’s thoughts and feelings. The novel, of course, is an unequaled medium for the exploration of human social and emotional life. And there is evidence that just as the brain responds to depictions of smells and textures and movements as if they were the real thing, so it treats the interactions among fictional characters as something like real-life social encounters. Raymond Mar, a psychologist at York University in Canada, performed an analysis of 86 fMRI studies, published last year in the Annual Review of Psychology, and concluded that there was substantial overlap in the brain networks used to understand stories and the networks used to navigate interactions with other individuals—in particular, interactions in which we’re trying to figure out the thoughts and feelings of others. Scientists call this capacity of the brain to construct a map of other people’s intentions “theory of mind.” Narratives offer a unique opportunity to engage this capacity, as we identify with characters’ longings and frustrations, guess at their hidden motives and track their encounters with friends and enemies, neighbors and lovers. It is an exercise that hones our real-life social skills, another body of research suggests. Dr. Oatley [an emeritus professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto] and Dr. Mar, in collaboration with several other scientists, reported in two studies, published in 2006 and 2009, that individuals who frequently read fiction seem to be better able to understand other people, empathize with them and see the world from their perspective. This relationship persisted even after the researchers accounted for the possibility that more empathetic individuals might prefer reading novels. A 2010 study by Dr. Mar found a similar result in preschool-age children: the more stories they had read to them, the keener their theory of mind—an effect that was also produced by watching movies but, curiously, not by watching television. . . . Fiction, Dr. Oatley notes, “is a particularly useful simulation because negotiating the social world effectively is extremely tricky, requiring us to weigh up myriad interacting instances of cause and effect. Just as computer simulations can help us get to grips with complex problems such as flying a plane or forecasting the weather, so novels, stories and dramas can help us understand the complexities of social life.” These findings will affirm the experience of readers who have felt illuminated and instructed by a novel, who have found themselves comparing a plucky young woman to Elizabeth Bennet or a tiresome pedant to Edward Casaubon. Reading great literature, it has long been averred, enlarges and improves us as human beings. Brain science shows this claim is truer than we imagined. 1.

Bu yapının antik Yunan dünyasının şehir (site) devletleri tecrübesi üzerinden geliştiğini dikkate almak gerekir. Dolayısıyla çok kültürlü yapı güçlü ve egemen çizgilerini antik Yunan kültüründen almıştır. Egitimin de böyle bir this day ve sından beslendiği rahatlıkla söylenebilir. Çünkü devrin eğitim, kültür, sanat ve bilim adına ortaya çıkan proje ve deneyimleri sosyalleşmelerini antik kültürden ağlamış olan bilge ve düşünürlerdir. Devletin kuruluşu ve toplumun düzeni ile ilgili olarak bu kategoride ortaya çıkan bilge kişilerin söylem ve yorumları siya- seten büyük ölçüde dikkate alınmıştır. Güzel söz söyleme ve hitabet (retorik) günlük hayatta olduğu kadar yönetimlerin de önem verdiği bir husus olmuştur. Eğitim sitemlerinde belirtilen pratik yarar için entelektüel eğitim ön plana çık mıştır. Büyük merkezlerde Hitabet okullarının kurulması askeri bir talimgah özelliği taşıyan eğitimin giderek daha az ilgi görmesi üzerine hitabet ve söyle- min silah gücünden üstün sayılarak vatandaşlık haklarının aranması ve korun- ması anlamına gelmektedir. 294 Ayrıca bu süreçte ortaya çıkan ve sayıları giderek artan felsefe okullarının bu bağlamda eğitim üzerinde belirleyici bir rolü olduğu düşünülebilir. Helenis- tik devrin hemen hemen bütün düşünce dünyası ve filozofları bu okullardan birine mensuptu. Epikuros Okulu, Peripatos Okulu, Stoa Okulu bu düşünce okullarının öne çıkan bazılarıdır. Bu okulların ortak olan bir tarafı ahlak üzerine yodaklanmış olmalarıdır. Ahlak bütün bu okullar için insanları mutluluğa ulaştı- ran bir gerçek bir vasıta, en doğru bir yoldur. Bu devirde değişik kademe ve alanlarda açılan okullar ise şunlardır: İlkokullar Askeri talim ve eğitime olan ilginin giderek azalması toplum ve devlet dü- zeyinde eğitimde entelektüel beklentilerin ortaya çıkmasına neden oldu. Okullar bu ihtiyacın karşılığı olarak genellikle şehirlerde kuruldu. Bu çerçevede özel ilkokullar terkedilmeye başlandı. İlkokul düzeyindeki okulların organizasyonu ve yürütülmesini toplum üstlenmişti. Sadece Mısır'da doğrudan doğruya devlet tarafından işletilmekteydi. Okullarda verilen eğitim okuma, yazma, hesap, re- sim, müzik, jimnastik dersleriyle sınırlıydı. Bu düzeyde kız ve erkek çocukları eşit eğitim görürlerdi. Beden terbiyesi gençlik yurtlarında düzenlenirdi. Ortaokullar/Gramer Okulları Öğretimin ikinci kademesi olarak yürütülmekteydi. 12-18 yaş aralığındaki her cinse hitap eden bu kademede eğitim özel teşebbüs tarafından organize edilir ve paralıdır. Bu nedenle de üst tabaka çocuklarına özgü hale gelmişti. 295 Ağırlıklı olarak klasik Yunanca öğretildiği için, klasik şair ve yazarlar ile onların eserleri okutulmaktaydı. Liseler (Gymnasion) Başlangıçta sadece jimnastik egzersizlerinin yapıldığı bu okullar, M.Ö. 4. yüzyıldan itibaren kültürel sosyalleşme merkezleri haline dönüştürülmüştür. Büyük spor salonları, havuzları, derslikleri, okul arşivleri, kitaplıkları bazen de Bergama'da olduğu gibi okul tiyatroları olan kompleks eğitim mekânları haline getirildi. Gymnasionlar tapınaklarla birlikte, Helenistik kentlerin en güzel yapı- larını oluşturdular. Belirtilen estetik ve gösterişli özellikleri nedeniyle bu okul- lar şehir ve bölgelerin Helenleştirilmesinde hatırı sayılır katkılar sağlamıştır. Bu okullarda efebe (ephebe) yetiştirme uygulaması terkedilerek gramer, retorik (hitabet) diyalektik ağırlıklı entelektüel eğitim verilmeye başlandı. Yükseköğretim Kademesi Yüksek kademede eğitim elbette feodal Avrupa ya da modern toplumlara denk düşen bir düzey değildir. Bundan genel öğretimin üstünde farklı ve özel eğitim program ve dersleri anlaşılmalıdır. Bu çerçevede retorik okulları da bu düzeyde bir eğitim ihtiyacına cevap veren kuruluşlardır. Bu dönemde yükseköğretimin ilk kademesinde genel eğitim (Enkylios Pai- dea) verlmekteydi. Günümüze kadar Avrupa liselerinin eğitim ideali buna bağlı olarak devam etmiştir. Sonraki dönemlerde bu eğitim \\"Yedi Özgür Sanat\\" baş- lığı altında yaygınlaşmış; feodal ortaçağdaki üniversite yapısı içinde en olgun dönemine ulaşmıştır. Retorik okullarının yanı sıra Platon Akameia'sı, Aristo- teles'in Lykeion'u; Stao Okulu, Epikurosçcu okul vb. bu çerçevede işlev gören eğitim ve sosyalleşme ortamlarıdır.

Helen Uygarlığı'nın çok kültürlü bir yapıda geliştiğinin vurgulanması. Bu, farklı kültürlerin bir araya gelerek zengin bir sosyo-kültürel yapı oluşturduğunu gösteriyor. 2. Antik Yunan dünyasının şehir devletleri tecrübesinin çok kültürlü yapıya güçlü bir temel sağladığı ve eğitimin de bu temelden beslendiği belirtiliyor. Bu, antik Yunan kültürünün eğitim sistemine ve düşünce yapısına ne kadar etkili olduğunu gösteriyor. 3. Eğitimde entelektüel beklentilerin ortaya çıkması ve okulların bu beklentilere cevap vermek için şehirlerde kurulması. Bu, toplumun ve devletin entelektüel gelişimi için eğitimin ne kadar önemli olduğunu gösteriyor. 4. Felsefe okullarının eğitim üzerinde belirleyici bir rol oynadığı ve ahlakın bu okullarda önemli bir odak noktası olduğu belirtiliyor. Bu, Helenistik devirde felsefenin ve ahlakın eğitim sistemi üzerindeki etkisini gösteriyor. 5. Okulların kültürel sosyalleşme merkezleri haline dönüşmesi ve spor salonları, tiyatrolar gibi alanların okul komplekslerine eklenmesi. Bu, eğitimin sadece akademik bilgiyi değil, kültürel ve sosyal gelişimi de hedeflediğini gösteriyor. 6. Yükseköğretim kademesinde retorik okullarının önemli bir yer tuttuğu ve genel eğitim verildiği belirtiliyor. Bu, Helenistik devirde eğitimin sadece temel bilgileri değil, sözlü iletişim becerilerini de önemsediğini gösteriyor. Bu kısımlar, Helenistik devirdeki eğitim sistemi ve düşünce yapısı hakkında önemli ipuçları veriyor ve bu dönemin eğitim anlayışının günümüzdeki eğitim sistemlerine ne kadar etkili olduğunu gösteriyor."},{"instruction":"아래 대화는 뭐라고 하는겁니까? trenton23241 3 days ago make a api where you can use anywhere ( i made a new acc just t say this) GreyForever 2 days ago • edited 2 days ago Lets think together about the subject for a second, if you read the disclaimer when u enter the space, this is for research purposes and they are actually paying for it.

Kant affirme que la non-existence, en tant que concept, est similaire à l'existence, mais diffère par le fait qu'elle ne correspond à aucune réalité empirique. Ainsi, lorsque nous parlons de quelque chose qui n'existe pas, comme une licorne, nous utilisons un concept qui n'a pas de correspondant dans le monde réel. Lorsque nous disons \\"une licorne n'existe pas\\", nous utilisons notre compréhension de ce qu'est une licorne (un animal mythique avec un corps de cheval et une corne sur la tête) et nous constatons que cela n'a pas de réalité empirique. En d'autres termes, nous reconnaissons qu'il n'y a aucune preuve ou expérience tangible de l'existence d'une licorne. Ce concept de non-existence est important pour Kant car il montre comment notre esprit peut former des idées et des concepts de choses qui n'ont pas de réalité réelle. Il souligne également la distinction entre la réalité empirique et les idées purement conceptuelles que nous pouvons former dans notre esprit."},{"instruction":"Que signifie \\"des formes a priori de la pensée humaine selon Kant. \\" ?","output":"\\"Des formes a priori de la pensée humaine selon Kant\\" fait référence à la théorie de Kant selon laquelle il existe des concepts et des structures fondamentales inhérentes à la pensée humaine qui nous permettent de percevoir, de comprendre et de donner un sens au monde qui nous entoure. Ces formes a priori sont des catégories universelles et nécessaires pour organiser notre expérience du monde. Selon Kant, notre esprit est doté de ces formes a priori, qui sont préalables à toute expérience et qui conditionnent notre manière de percevoir et de concevoir le monde. Ces formes proviennent de la structure innée de l'esprit humain et sont donc indépendantes de toute expérience individuelle. Par exemple, Kant identifie des formes a priori telles que le temps et l'espace. Le temps est une catégorie fondamentale qui organise notre perception du monde, tandis que l'espace est une forme a priori qui nous permet de situer les objets les uns par rapport aux autres. Ces concepts ne sont pas appris ou déduits de l'expérience, mais font partie intégrante de la manière dont nous structurons notre pensée.

Pluralité : la capacité de percevoir des objets en relation avec d'autres objets. 3. Totalité : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme faisant partie d'un ensemble plus vaste. 4. Réalité : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme étant existant. 5. Négation : la capacité de concevoir l'absence ou l'opposé d'un objet. 6. Limitation : la capacité de concevoir les limites ou les frontières d'un objet. 7. Substance : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme ayant une existence indépendante. 8. Causalité : la capacité de concevoir la relation de cause à effet entre les objets. 9. Communauté : la capacité de concevoir l'interaction ou la relation entre les objets. 10. Possibilité : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme étant potentiellement réalisable. 11. Existence : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme ayant une existence réelle et concrète. 12. Nécessité : la capacité de concevoir un objet comme étant inévitable ou inconditionnel.

They can be more vulnerable to online predators, cyberbullying, and exposure to inappropriate content that may have long-lasting negative effects on their mental and emotional well-being. 2) Developmental concerns: Young children are still in the process of developing their social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Excessive use of social media at such a young age can interfere with their healthy development, impacting their ability to engage in real-life social interactions, develop empathy, and maintain focus on academic or creative pursuits. 3) Unhealthy comparison and self-esteem issues: Social media platforms often present idealized versions of life, which can lead to negative self-comparison and decreased self-esteem. Children under 14 may struggle with understanding that the carefully curated posts and filtered images do not represent reality, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their own lives. 4) Privacy concerns: Young children may not fully understand the concept of privacy and the potential consequences of sharing personal information online. This puts them at risk of identity theft, online scams, or being targeted by cybercriminals. 5) Distraction from real-life activities: Excessive use of social media can divert children's attention from important real-life activities such as studies, physical exercise, hobbies, and face-to-face interactions. This can have a detrimental impact on their overall well-being and development. 6) Lack of digital literacy skills: Children under 14 may not possess the necessary digital literacy skills to discern between reliable and unreliable information on social media. They may easily fall prey to misinformation, propaganda, and fake news, which can negatively influence their understanding of various topics and events. 7) Sleep disruption: The use of social media, particularly near bedtime, can disrupt children's sleep patterns. The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with melatonin production, leading to difficulties falling asleep and poorer overall sleep quality.

Here are the most common options: # By Train: Taking a train is one of the most convenient ways to travel from Huddersfield to London as it doesn't require the stress of driving and allows you to relax or work during the journey. 1. Direct Route: There may not be direct trains from Huddersfield to London, meaning you might have to change trains during the journey. 2. Typical Route: The common route might involve taking a train from Huddersfield to Manchester Piccadilly, Leeds, or another major station, and then transferring to a London-bound train to either London King’s Cross or London Euston station. 3. Duration: The journey usually takes between 2.5 to 3.5 hours depending on the service and the number of changes. 4. Booking: It's a good idea to book tickets in advance to get the best fares. Tickets can be purchased online through National Rail Enquiries or through various other ticketing websites. # By Coach: Another cheaper but slower option is traveling by long-distance coach. 1. Coach Services: Companies like National Express or Megabus operate coach services that run between Huddersfield and London. 2. Duration: The journey can take around 5 to 7 hours depending on traffic conditions and the specific service chosen. 3. Booking: You should book your coach ticket in advance. You can do this online via the coach operators' websites. # By Car: If you prefer to drive, you can rent a car or use your own. 1. Route: The most common driving route would take you via the M1 motorway, which goes directly to London from the north. 2. Distance: The distance is approximately 185 miles (about 298 kilometers). 3. Duration: The drive typically takes around 3.5 to 4.5 hours depending on traffic and speed. 4. Considerations: Remember that parking in London can be difficult and expensive, and the city operates a congestion charge zone, so this should be factored into your decision. # By Flight: While there are no commercial flights between Huddersfield and London, you could take a train to a nearby airport like Manchester and then fly to one of London's airports. This would generally not be time or cost-efficient for such a short distance, so it's not a recommended option unless you are connecting from an international flight. Remember to check the latest travel times and ticket prices as they can vary depending on the time of day, the time of year, and any ongoing rail or road works."},{"instruction":"how to implement quick sort in c++","output":"Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes the divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements.

Below is a Scala example that recursively parses an infix expression into a binary tree, then recursively traverses the tree in postorder to produce the Reverse Polish notation: \`\`\`scala sealed trait Expr case class Operand(value: Char) extends Expr case class Operator(op: Char, left: Expr, right: Expr) extends Expr object InfixToPostfix { // A simple method to define precedence of operators def precedence(op: Char): Int = op match { case '+' | '-' => 1 case '*' | '/' => 2 case _ => 0 } // A simple method to check if a character is an operator def isOperator(c: Char): Boolean = precedence(c) > 0 // Parse infix expression and build a binary tree def parseInfix(expr: String): Expr = { def parse(tokens: List[Char]): (Expr, List[Char]) = tokens match { case c :: rest if c.isLetter => (Operand(c), rest) case c :: rest if isOperator(c) => val (leftExpr, afterLeft) = parse(rest) val (rightExpr, remaining) = parse(afterLeft) (Operator(c, leftExpr, rightExpr), remaining) case _ => throw new IllegalArgumentException(\\"Invalid expression\\") } parse(expr.toList)._1 } // Convert the binary tree to postfix expression def toPostfix(expr: Expr): String = expr match { case Operand(value) => value.toString case Operator(op, left, right) => toPostfix(left) + toPostfix(right) + op } def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { val infix = \\"A*B+C\\" val tree = parseInfix(infix) val postfix = toPostfix(tree) println(s\\"Infix: infix\\") println(s\\"Postfix: postfix\\") } } \`\`\` Please note that the above Scala code assumes that the infix expression is fully parenthesized where every operator follows its two operands. For example, \`A*B+C\` is considered as \`((A*B)+C)\`. If this is not the case, and you have non-fully parenthesized expressions, you would need a more sophisticated parser that takes operator precedence and associativity into account. The parsing function here recursively decomposes the expression into a binary expression tree of \`Operators\` and \`Operands\`. Then, \`toPostfix\` performs a post-order traversal of that tree to produce the postfix notation. Running the provided \`main\` method with this fully parenthesized input will print out the postfix expression. For non-fully parenthesized expressions, you would need to incorporate a method of handling operator precedence and associativity in your parse tree construction. This often involves managing a stack of operators, as in the Shunting Yard algorithm. As it stands, the code example is educational and tailored for very specific types of expressions and should be used as a starting point. Depending on your requirement, you may need a more robust parsing strategy to handle all valid infix expressions."},{"instruction":"class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { double[] x = new double[] { 0.089, 0.429, 0.769, 1.109, 1.449, 1.789, 2.129, 2.469, 2.809 };

Online safety concerns: Young children may not possess the necessary skills to identify and avoid potential online dangers such as cyberbullying, identity theft, or inappropriate content. They may also be more susceptible to sharing personal information with strangers, increasing the risk of exploitation or grooming. 2. Emotional and mental health impacts: Social media platforms can be addictive and negatively impact a child’s emotional well-being. Research suggests that excessive social media use can lead to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Young children might find it harder to navigate conflicts or negative interactions online, leading to emotional distress. 3. Impact on physical health and development: Spending prolonged periods of time on social media can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other physical health issues in children. Additionally, excessive screen time can interfere with sleep patterns, affecting overall development and academic performance. 4. Negative influence on social skills: Social media can hinder the development of crucial social skills among young children. They may struggle with face-to-face interactions, empathy, and effective communication when their primary mode of communication is through screens. This can lead to difficulties in building healthy relationships, both online and offline. 5. Privacy concerns: Children, especially those under 14, may not fully understand the consequences and long-term implications of sharing personal information or images online. This could result in potential privacy breaches, unwanted attention, or exploitation. 6. Educational impact: Spending excessive time on social media can divert a child’s attention from academics, affecting their ability to focus, concentrate, and retain information. It may also hinder their ability to engage in creative activities, physical exercise, or hands-on learning. 7. Unrealistic comparisons and negative self-image: Social media tends to promote heavily curated and filtered representations of life, leading to unrealistic comparisons and feelings of inadequacy among children. Constant exposure to carefully constructed highlights of other people’s lives can negatively impact a child's self-esteem and body image. 8. Cyberbullying and harassment: Children under 14 who use social media may be more vulnerable to cyberbullying and harassment from peers or even strangers. They may lack the emotional resilience and coping mechanisms required to handle such situations effectively. 9. Predatory behavior: Pedophiles and other online predators actively use social media platforms to target vulnerable individuals, including young children. Allowing children to access social media platforms before they are developmentally ready could increase their exposure to potential dangers. 10. Limited parent oversight: Young children may not possess the maturity or critical thinking skills to navigate social media responsibly. Parental guidance and supervision are crucial in ensuring children's safety and proper use of social media, but this can be challenging if parents are unaware of or unfamiliar with the platforms themselves."},{"instruction":"How can I forgive my husband for cheating and hurting my feelings so baddly?","output":"Forgiving someone who has cheated and hurt your feelings profoundly can be an incredibly challenging process. However, if you genuinely want to work towards forgiveness and healing, here are a few steps you can take: 1. Allow yourself to feel: It's crucial to acknowledge and process your emotions. Give yourself permission to grieve, be angry, and express your pain. Ignoring or suppressing your feelings may hinder the healing process. 2. Express your hurt and anger: Communicate openly with your husband about how his actions have affected you. This honest conversation can help both of you confront the situation and understand each other's perspectives. 3. Seek professional help: Consider couples therapy or individual counseling to receive guidance from a neutral party who can support you in navigating the complicated emotions surrounding infidelity. A therapist can also help foster open communication and provide tools to rebuild trust. 4. Establish boundaries: Determine what is acceptable to you going forward and set boundaries regarding communication, transparency, and rebuilding trust. Both partners need to agree and adhere to these boundaries to rebuild your relationship effectively. 5. Take time for self-care: Prioritize self-care, as emotional healing will require time and attention. Engage in activities that bring you joy and take care of your emotional, physical, and mental well-being. 6. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups who can provide a safe space to share your feelings and receive understanding and empathy. 7. Reflect on your relationship: Evaluate your relationship and assess if both of you are committed to the process of rebuilding trust and working on the underlying issues that led to the infidelity. Sometimes, professional help is necessary to facilitate this reflection. 8. Be patient: Forgiveness is a journey that takes time. Healing and rebuilding trust after infidelity typically require both partners' commitment, patience, and understanding. Remember, forgiveness is a personal choice, and it may not be achievable or appropriate for everyone. Ultimately, the decision rests with you, and it is essential to prioritize your emotional well-being throughout the process."},{"instruction":"","output":"What can my husband do to demonstrate his remorse and earn my forgiveness?"},{"instruction":"find me the most affordable travel package to punta del este uruguay","output":"I'm an AI language model and don't have real-time access to travel information or prices.

Quais seus argumentos e conclusões? Explique de uma forma abrangente, profunda e rica em detalhes, com exemplos quando poderem ser usados.","output":"John Duns Scotus (1266–1308), frequentemente conhecido como o Doutor Sutil, foi um dos filósofos e teólogos mais importantes do período escolástico na Idade Média. Sua obra é reconhecida pela complexidade e acuidade de seus argumentos teológicos e filosóficos. Um de seus principais contributos para a filosofia da religião é o seu argumento sobre a existência de Deus, que é distinto dos argumentos mais conhecidos de outros escolásticos como Santo Anselmo ou São Tomás de Aquino. O argumento de Duns Scotus para a existência de Deus é muitas vezes referido como o argumentum univocum, ou o argumento da univocidade do ser. Duns Scotus defende a noção de que a existência de Deus pode ser inferida a partir da ideia de que é possível falar sobre o ser (existência) de forma unívoca tanto para Deus quanto para as criaturas, mesmo reconhecendo a enorme disparidade entre a finitude das criaturas e a infinitude de Deus. Aqui está um esboço dos aspectos-chave do argumento de Duns Scotus: 1. **Univocidade do ser**: Duns Scotus argumenta contra a concepção de Tomás de Aquino de que a existência é dita de Deus e das criaturas apenas de maneira análoga. Em vez disso, Scotus sustenta que \\"ser\\" ou \\"existir\\" é um conceito que se aplica de forma unívoca, embora não seja compreendido da mesma maneira, a Deus e às criaturas. Isso significa que quando dizemos que alguma coisa \\"é\\", estamos usando o termo \\"é\\" no mesmo sentido básico, quer estejamos falando de Deus, de pessoas ou de pedras. 2. **Contingência das Criaturas e Necessidade de uma Causa Primal**: Scotus argumenta que o mundo consiste em entidades contingentes, coisas que poderiam falhar em existir. Por serem contingentes, elas precisam de uma explicação para a sua existência fora delas mesmas, algo que não seja contingente. 3. **Arguição a partir da causalidade**: Baseando-se na ideia de causalidade, Duns Scotus propõe que todas as causas contingentes necessitam de uma causa primeira que não seja ela própria contingente, ou seja, uma causa necessária. Ele procura evitar um regresso ao infinito na cadeia causal, pois isso não forneceria uma explicação adequada para a existência do conjunto de entidades contingentes. 4. **Esta Causa Primeira é Deus**: Por fim, Duns Scotus conclui que a causa primeira ou a causa necessária das coisas contingentes deve ser Deus, um ser cuja essência implica a sua existência e que não depende de nada mais para a sua existência. Deus, portanto, é a causa necessária e última do universo contingente. Duns Scotus reconhece que o ser pode ser entendido de forma eminentemente em Deus e de forma limitada nas criaturas, mas o ponto crucial é que existe uma concepção comum de \\"ser\\" que permite à mente humana raciocinar sobre Deus e as criaturas. É importante notar que o argumento de Scotus não prova diretamente certos atributos de Deus, tais como onipotência, onisciência, ou benevolência, que são típicos do Deus da teologia cristã. Em vez disso, ele procura estabelecer a existência de uma causa primeira necessária, que os teólogos depois identificam com o Deus das tradições monoteístas. Outro ponto a ser destacado é que, para Duns Scotus, a questão da vontade divina é central. Ele postulou que a vontade de Deus é logicamente anterior à sua intelectualidade, o que se tornou uma característica distintiva de sua teologia. Isso significa que, para Scotus, Deus escolheu criar o mundo que existe como um ato de vontade, e não porque o conhecimento intelectual de Deus determinasse que somente este mundo poderia vir a existir."},{"instruction":"Abranja o tópico da univocidade do ser","output":"A univocidade do ser é um conceito crucial na metafísica, especialmente na filosofia de John Duns Scotus. Ela se refere ao modo pelo qual o termo “ser” é aplicado tanto a Deus quanto às criaturas. Para entender melhor, vamos contrastar a perspectiva de Scotus com outros tipos de predicação, como a analogia e a equivocidade. 1. **Univocidade**: Quando falamos de univocidade, queremos dizer um único conceito de \\"ser\\" que é aplicado igualmente a tudo o que existe, embora se possa manifestar ou ser realizado em diferentes graus de perfeição ou em maneiras diversas. Portanto, quando Duns Scotus afirma que \\"ser\\" é unívoco, ele está dizendo que estamos lidando com a mesma noção fundamental de existência, independentemente de sermos referentes a seres finitos ou a Deus, o ser infinito. O conceito de \\"ser\\" é válido e aplicável para todos os entes, e não há uma diferença radical ou essencial no que significa existir. - **Exemplo**: Imaginemos a comparação entre um ser humano, uma árvore, e Deus sob a luz da univocidade. Quando dizemos que cada um \\"é\\", estamos dizendo algo fundamentalmente semelhante sobre a sua existência, mesmo que cada um exista de maneira muito diferente. 2. **Analogia**: Em contraste, Tomás de Aquino e outros escolásticos argumentaram que a existência de Deus e das criaturas só poderia ser falada de maneira análoga. Ou seja, quando dizemos que Deus é e uma criatura é, estamos usando o termo \\"ser\\" de maneiras que estão relacionadas, mas não idênticas. Há uma similaridade, mas o ser divino é incomparavelmente maior e mais perfeito do que qualquer ser criado. - **Exemplo**: Ao falar que a saúde \\"é\\" em um medicamento e \\"é\\" no corpo, usamos o termo “saúde” de forma análoga. O medicamento possui saúde em um sentido diferente do corpo, pois ele é a causa da saúde sem, de fato, ser um organismo que tem saúde. 3. **Equivocidade**: A equivocidade seria o outro extremo, no qual um termo é usado em múltiplos sentidos que não têm relação um com o outro. Portanto, se dissermos que \\"ser\\" é equívoco, então usaríamos o mesmo som ou a mesma palavra para nos referirmos à existência de Deus e das criaturas, mas sem que houvesse uma noção compartilhada do que isso significa. - **Exemplo**: A palavra \\"banco\\" pode ser usada para referir a uma instituição financeira ou a uma mobília para sentar, mas ambos os usos não compartilham um significado comum. Scotus argumentava que deve haver uma noção comum de ser, que não fosse meramente análoga, para se poder falar coletamente de Deus e das criaturas e para fazer predicações válidas e significativas sobre a existência. Sem a univocidade do ser, seria impossível para nós argumentar logicamente sobre Deus a partir de nossa experiência das criaturas; e sem a univocidade, o próprio argumento ontológico para a existência de Deus estaria em risco, pois as premissas aplicadas às criaturas já não seriam aplicáveis a Deus. A univocidade, portanto, dá uma base metodológica para a teologia natural e para a possibilidade de conhecer e discutir sobre Deus com base na experiência do mundo."},{"instruction":"Напиши сочинение на тему: \\"Какова роль искусства в жизни общества\\".

However, due to the nature of game optimization, results can vary significantly depending on the specific hardware configuration, software environment, and the particular demands of in-game locations and situations. Given your current configuration and software, here are some potential adjustments you can make: 1. Async Compilation: - \`dxvk.enableAsync = True\`: You already have asynchronous shader compilation enabled, which helps in reducing stutter caused by on-the-fly shader compilation. 2. Number of Compiler Threads: - \`dxvk.numCompilerThreads = 14\`: You've set 14 compiler threads. Given you have 32 threads available, you might experiment with increasing this value to make full use of your CPU, especially if it isn't fully utilized in-game. 3. Number of Async Threads: - \`dxvk.numAsyncThreads = 14\`: Similar to compiler threads, you can experiment with this value to optimize CPU usage. It’s generally recommended to match with the number of compiler threads or leave it to the default if you're unsure. 4. Maximum Framerate: - \`dxvk.maxFrameRate = 0\`: This setting allows for an uncapped framerate. If you're experiencing inconsistent frame times, consider setting a frame rate cap slightly below your monitor's refresh rate for a more consistent experience. 5. Back Buffers and Frame Latency: - \`d3d9.numBackBuffers = 3\`: A higher number of back buffers can increase input lag, but reduce screen tearing. You might want to play around with setting it to 2 to see if that helps reduce input lag without introducing significant tearing. - \`d3d9.maxFrameLatency = 1\`: Keeping this low is good for input responsiveness. 6. Memory Availability: - \`d3d9.maxAvailableMemory = 4096\`: This setting is appropriate given the age of WoW and the fact that you've applied a 4GB patch to the executable. 7. Anisotropic Filtering: - \`d3d9.samplerAnisotropy = 16\`: This is good for maintaining sharp textures at oblique viewing angles. Since your main concerns are sharpness and graphical quality, keep anisotropic filtering at 16. The rest of the settings you've listed are fairly typical and shouldn't need adjusting for your use case. However, if you're still seeing dips in frame rates during 25-man raids, you may need to fine-tune other settings more specific to the game or perhaps reduce the load of certain add-ons as WoW 3.3.5a is indeed heavily CPU-bound and not well optimized for modern multi-threaded CPUs. Remember to back up your current \`dxvk.conf\` before making changes so you can easily revert if necessary. And as always, changes to configuration files should be made incrementally, testing each change's impact on performance and stability before proceeding with the next."},{"instruction":"What needs to be the values of tx_gain and rx_gain in enb.conf and ue.conf in a srsRAN 4G LTE network?","output":"The values of tx_gain and rx_gain in enb.conf and ue.conf in a srsRAN 4G LTE network are typically dependent on the specific hardware, antenna setup, and signal propagation conditions of the network. tx_gain refers to the transmission power or gain that the eNodeB (base station) uses to transmit signals to the UE (user equipment). It is usually measured in dBm (decibels relative to 1 milliwatt). The appropriate value for tx_gain can vary based on factors such as the distance between the eNodeB and the UE, the presence of obstacles or interference, and the specific capabilities of the hardware being used. It is typically set by the network operator or system administrator based on network planning and optimization considerations. It may be obtained through field measurements or network simulations. rx_gain refers to the receive power or gain that the UE uses to receive signals from the eNodeB. Like tx_gain, it is also measured in dBm. The appropriate value for rx_gain is primarily determined by the sensitivity and capabilities of the UE's receiver. It is typically set by the manufacturer and optimized for the specific hardware and network conditions. In most cases, the UE's rx_gain settings do not need to be manually configured but are automatically adjusted by the UE software based on the received signal strength and quality. It is recommended to consult the hardware documentation and/or the system administrator for specific guidance on setting the tx_gain and rx_gain values in the enb.conf and ue.conf configuration files in a srsRAN 4G LTE network."},{"instruction":"Why there could be attach failure of srsue with srsenb in srsRAN 4G?","output":"There can be several reasons for an attach failure of srsUE with srsENB in srsRAN 4G. Some possible causes include: 1. Configuration mismatch: If the configuration parameters in enb.conf (eNodeB configuration file) and ue.conf (UE configuration file) do not match or are incompatible, it can lead to attach failure. It is important to ensure that the settings such as PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) ID, frequency bands, and security-related parameters are correctly configured and consistent across the eNodeB and UE. 2. Incompatible hardware or software versions: srsRAN is constantly evolving and new features are being added in different releases. If the srsENB and srsUE are using incompatible hardware or software versions, it can result in compatibility issues and attach failure. It is advisable to use compatible and up-to-date versions of both components. 3. Radio signal issues: Attach failure can occur if there are radio signal propagation problems such as weak signal strength, high interference, or improper antenna alignment. In such cases, the UE may struggle to establish a reliable connection with the eNodeB, leading to attach failure. 4. Network coverage issues: If the network coverage of the srsRAN 4G deployment is insufficient in the location where the srsUE is attempting to attach, it can result in attach failure. Lack of suitable cell coverage, inadequate cell density, or gaps in coverage can affect the UE's ability to successfully attach to the network. 5. Authentication and security issues: If there are issues with the authentication and security mechanisms in the network, such as incorrect security keys, authentication algorithm mismatches, or invalid certificates, it can lead to attach failure. 6. System capacity limitations: If the srsENB is already serving the maximum number of attached UEs or if it is unable to allocate sufficient resources for a new UE, it can result in attach failure. This can happen when the eNodeB is overloaded or when there are limitations in the system capacity. In case of attach failure, it is recommended to check the logs and debug output of both the srsENB and srsUE for more specific error messages and indications about the cause of the failure. This can help in identifying and troubleshooting the issue more effectively."},{"instruction":"How to check the logs and debug output of both the srsENB and srsUE?","output":"To check the logs and debug output of srsENB and srsUE in a srsRAN 4G network, you can follow these steps: 1. Open a terminal or command prompt session on the machine where srsENB and/or srsUE are running. 2. Navigate to the directory where the srsENB and/or srsUE software is installed. 3. Look for log files generated by the software. The exact location and filename may vary depending on your configuration and setup. Typically, log files are stored in a subdirectory named \\"logs\\" or \\"log\\" within the software installation directory. 4. Identify the relevant log file(s) for srsENB and/or srsUE. The log files may have names like \\"enb.log\\" or \\"ue.log\\". 5. Open the log file(s) using a text editor or command-line tools like \`less\` or \`tail\`.

The specific changes required in srsepc.conf depend on the network deployment and specific requirements. However, here are some common parameters that may need to be configured in the srsepc.conf file: 1. MME parameters: You may need to specify parameters such as MME IP address, port number, and MME name for proper communication with the base station (eNodeB) and UE. The MME parameters allow the UE to authenticate, attach, and establish a connection with the network. 2. HSS parameters: HSS is responsible for storing subscriber information and authenticating the UE. In srsepc.conf, you may need to configure HSS IP address and port number to establish communication and ensure proper authentication and authorization for the UE. 3. SGW parameters: SGW acts as a gateway between the E-UTRAN (Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and the packet data network. You may need to specify the SGW IP address and port number to ensure proper routing of user data traffic. 4. PLMN parameters: PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) configuration includes the MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code) values that uniquely identify the network operator. You may need to specify these values in srsepc.conf for correct network identification during attach procedures. 5. Network interfaces: The interfaces between different EPC components need to be configured properly. You may need to specify the IP addresses, port numbers, and transport protocols (e.g., S1AP, GTP) used for inter-component communication. 6. Security parameters: Depending on the network security policies, you may need to enable or configure security features such as encryption and integrity protection for the control plane and user plane communication. These are just a few examples, and the specific changes required in srsepc.conf can vary based on the network deployment scenario, EPC architecture, and desired functionalities. It's important to refer to the srsRAN documentation and consult with network planning and optimization experts to accurately configure the srsepc.conf file for your specific network requirements."},{"instruction":"What are the configuration parameters in enb.conf (eNodeB configuration file) and ue.conf (UE configuration file) that need to match or be compatible, in order to properly attach srsUE with srsenb in srsRAN 4G LTE network?","output":"In order to properly attach srsUE with srsENB in a srsRAN 4G LTE network, several configuration parameters in enb.conf (eNodeB configuration file) and ue.conf (UE configuration file) need to match or be compatible. Here are some important parameters that should be consistent between the two configuration files: 1. Frequency bands: The frequency band supported by the eNodeB and the UE should match.

J'aimerais donc des conseils ou une méthode pour m'aider à trouver des métaphores","output":"La création de métaphores peut ajouter de la profondeur et de la beauté à une chanson, et permet de rendre l'expression des faits plus poétique et plus évocatrice. Voici une série d'étapes et conseils pour vous aider à trouver des métaphores adaptées à votre chanson : 1. **Comprendre le thème** : Avant de trouver des métaphores, il est crucial de bien comprendre le thème central de votre chanson et les émotions ou les messages clefs que vous voulez transmettre. 2. **Identifier les faits clés** : Quels sont les événements ou faits réels que vous voulez décrire ? Faites une liste des éléments fondamentaux de l'histoire ou de la réalité que vous voulez capturer. 3. **Exploration d'images** : Pour chaque fait ou idée, listez toutes les images qui vous viennent à l'esprit. Ne vous censurez pas ; faites simplement un brainstorming d'images possibles. 4. **Rechercher des associations** : Interrogez-vous sur ce que ces faits évoquent en termes d'images, de sensations, d'éléments de la nature ou d'objets. Par exemple, une séparation peut être métaphorisée par la chute des feuilles en automne ou un adieu dans une gare déserte. 5. **Utilisation des sens** : Pensez aux cinq sens. Comment pourriez-vous décrire les faits en utilisant des références auditives, visuelles, tactiles, gustatives ou olfactives ? 6. **Utilisation de la symbolique** : Certains éléments ont des significations symboliques universelles. Par exemple, une tempête peut représenter le chaos ou des difficultés, un phare peut symboliser l'espoir ou la direction, etc. 7. **Jouer avec les contrastes** : Souvent, les métaphores sont puissantes lorsque deux idées apparemment opposées sont associées. Par exemple, décrire un moment de silence avec une image bruyante (comme le crash d'une vague) peut mettre en lumière le caractère remarquable de ce silence. 8. **Lire de la poésie et des paroles de chanson** : S'imprégner de la manière dont les poètes et paroliers utilisent les métaphores peut vous inspirer et vous donner des exemples de la façon dont les images peuvent être utilisées de manière créative. 9. **Écrire sans censure** : Au début, écrivez toutes les idées qui vous viennent, même celles qui semblent bizarres ou inadéquates. La créativité repose souvent sur la capacité à combiner des idées de manière inattendue. 10. **Révision et peaufinage** : Après avoir rassemblé vos idées métaphoriques, prenez le temps de les affiner. Demandez-vous si l'image transmet le bon sentiment ou message, et si elle s'accorde avec le thème général de la chanson. 11. **Obtenir des retours** : N'hésitez pas à partager vos métaphores avec d'autres pour obtenir leur réaction. Parfois, ce qui est clair pour vous peut être obscur pour quelqu'un d'autre, et vice versa. Il est aussi important de se rappeler que trouver des métaphores est un processus qui peut nécessiter du temps. Donnez-vous la liberté d'expérimenter et d'être patient avec votre processus créatif. Avec ces étapes et un peu de pratique, vous devriez être capable de trouver des métaphores riches et expressives pour votre chanson."},{"instruction":"j'aimerais ajouter des rimes. J'aimerais une méthode pour cela également","output":"L'utilisation de rimes peut renforcer l'impact d'une chanson et aider à créer un flux mélodique plaisant. Vous trouverez ci-dessous une méthode en plusieurs étapes pour intégrer des rimes dans vos paroles : 1. **Comprendre les types de rimes** : Familiarisez-vous avec les différents types de rimes, notamment : - **Rimes parfaites** : C'est lorsque les sons des syllabes finales sont identiques (ex. \\"chat\\" et \\"mat\\"). - **Rimes riches** : En plus du son de la dernière syllabe, d’autres sons dans les mots riment (ex. \\"chanteur\\" et \\"danseur\\"). - **Rimes suffisantes** : Seuls les sons des voyelles riment (ex. \\"temps\\" et \\"champ\\"). - **Rimes pauvres** : Une consonne finale rime avec une autre loi (ex. \\"temps\\" et \\"lent\\"). - **Rimes internes** : La rime se produit à l'intérieur d'une ligne ou entre une fin de ligne et un mot au milieu de la ligne suivante. - **Rimes embrassées** : Le schéma de rime suit ABBA. - **Rimes plates** : Rimes consécutives suivant le schéma AABB. - **Rimes croisées** : Rimes alternées suivant le schéma ABAB. 2. **Utilisation d'un dictionnaire de rimes** : Un dictionnaire de rimes peut être un outil précieux pour trouver des mots qui riment. Il existe de nombreux dictionnaires de rimes en ligne qui peuvent faciliter cette recherche. 3. **Construire autour de mots-clés** : Choisissez des mots-clés dans vos paroles qui correspondent aux points importants de votre chanson. Trouvez des rimes pour ces mots, et construisez vos vers autour de ceux-ci. 4. **Établir une structure de vers** : Décidez de la structure des rimes de votre chanson (par exemple, ABAB, AABB, etc.). Cette structure donnera une cohérence à votre texte et guidera où vous placez vos rimes. 5. **Écrire par rimes spontanées** : Commencez par la fin ! Trouvez un bon mot de fin de vers qui rime et construirez le reste du vers pour mener à ce mot. 6. **Expérimentation sonore** : N'hésitez pas à expérimenter avec des rimes imparfaites ou des assonances pour ajouter de la variété et de la musicalité à votre chanson. 7. **Lire à voix haute** : Une fois que vous avez écrit quelques vers, lisez-les à voix haute pour écouter le flux des rimes et ajuster lorsque nécessaire. 8. **Tenir compte du rythme** : Assurez-vous que l'ajout de rimes ne nuit pas au rythme naturel de la langue. Il faut parfois sacrifier une rime parfaite pour le bien de la cadence de la chanson. 9. **Recherche d'originalité** : Essayer d'éviter les rimes trop communes ou clichées en cherchant des mots plus originaux ou inattendus qui riment quand même. 10. **Penser à la signification** : Au-delà de la rime, les paroles doivent avant tout porter votre message. Assurez-vous que l'ajout de rimes n'altère pas le sens que vous voulez donner à votre chanson. 11. **Réviser et affiner** : La révision est une partie cruciale du processus d'écriture des paroles. Revenez régulièrement sur vos rimes pour les améliorer et vous assurer qu'elles servent bien la chanson dans son ensemble. L'emploi de rimes dans l'écriture de chansons exige un équilibre entre la forme et le fond. Pensez toujours à la façon dont les rimes s'intègrent dans l'histoire que vous racontez ou dans les émotions que vous tentez d'exprimer."},{"instruction":"j'ai composé un morceau de musique qui renvoit à la tragédie et au désespoir. Le texte est aussi sensé renvoyer ce message. Mais est-ce une bonne idée ? En effet je trouve qu'il y a trop de desespoir dans ma chanson","output":"La création d'une chanson qui évoque des émotions telles que la tragédie et le désespoir peut être un moyen puissant de connecter avec vos auditeurs par une expérience partagée de ces sentiments. Cependant, il est important de maintenir un équilibre afin que la chanson ne soit pas accablante ou unilatérale, au point qu'elle devienne difficile à écouter. Voici quelques éléments à considérer pour équilibrer votre chanson : 1. **Contraste dans les paroles** : Essayez d'introduire un contraste dans les paroles pour offrir un éventail plus large d'émotions. Par exemple, des moments lumineux ou des souvenirs heureux peuvent accentuer par contraste la profondeur du désespoir présent. 2. **Espoir et résilience** : Même si le thème central est triste ou tragique, envisagez d'inclure des éléments d'espoir ou de résilience. Un message sur la capacité à surmonter les épreuves ou à trouver de la lumière dans l'obscurité peut ajouter une dimension inspirante à la chanson. 3. **Variété dans la composition musicale** : Dans votre composition musicale, envisagez de jouer avec les dynamiques, la tonalité et le rythme pour créer des variations qui reflètent un spectre plus large d'émotions. 4. **Refrains ou ponts** : Les refrains, ponts ou autres éléments structuraux de la chanson peuvent offrir un moment de répit ou un changement de perspective dans le flot des émotions. 5. **Métaphores et images** : Les métaphores et les images lyriques utilisées dans vos paroles peuvent offrir de la profondeur et permettre aux auditeurs d'interpréter la chanson d'une manière qui résonne personnellement pour eux. 6. **Sujet universel** : Concentrez-vous sur des thèmes universels qui permettent aux auditeurs de s'identifier à la chanson et de trouver leur propre signification ou consolation. 7. **Interprétation personnelle** : Laissez de l'espace pour que les auditeurs puissent interpréter la chanson à leur manière. L'ambiguïté peut être puissante et peut aider les gens à se connecter de différentes manières. 8. **Histoire narrative** : Une narration qui se développe au fil de la chanson peut guider l'auditeur à travers l'histoire et les émotions sans les submerger. 9. **Enchaînement des chansons** : Si votre chanson fait partie d'un album ou d'un EP, la séquence des titres peut également aider à équilibrer les émotions. Un morceau tragique peut être suivi ou précédé par un autre qui a une tonalité différente. Le plus important est d'être authentique et vrai dans votre expression artistique. Si le désespoir est ce que vous voulez véhiculer et qu'il est fidèle à votre vision artistique, il est tout à fait légitime de le faire. Gardez à l'esprit que la musique permet aux auditeurs de ressentir une gamme d'émotions, et une chanson remplie de désespoir peut être aussi cathartique qu'une chanson joyeuse."},{"instruction":"En quoi cette chanson d'amour appelée \\"Amour plastique\\" suit les conseils donnés ici ?","output":"\\"Amour Plastique\\" est une chanson du groupe français Videoclub, sorti en 2018. Pour analyser en quoi cette chanson suit les conseils donnés précédemment sur l'écriture de chansons, utilisons les paroles et la composition musicales pour voir comment ils correspondent. 1. **Contraste dans les paroles** : Bien que \\"Amour Plastique\\" ne soit pas une chanson de désespoir, elle utilise des contrastes pour mettre en valeur les émotions complexes de l'amour adolescent.

Voici une analyse qui prend en compte les conseils précédemment discutés : 1. **Métaphores et images**: Le texte est truffé de métaphores (ex. \\"la vague de ton regard amoureux\\", \\"fleur, une femme dans ton cœur Roméo\\") qui créent des images visuelles fortes. L'utilisation de références littéraires (Roméo, évoquant l'histoire d'amour tragique de \\"Roméo et Juliette\\") amplifie l'impact émotionnel et le thème de l'amour passionnel et potentiellement destructeur. 2. **Interprétation personnelle**: Les paroles sont à la fois spécifiques et ouvertes à l'interprétation, permettant aux auditeurs de mettre leurs propres expériences et sentiments dans les mots de la chanson. 3. **Contraste dans les paroles**: Les paroles évoquent l'obscurité et la lumière, la passion et la perte, la présence et l'absence (\\"Et la nuit quand tout est sombre je te regarde danser\\"), offrant un contraste émotionnel qui attire l'auditeur dans un va-et-vient entre le désespoir et l'amour. 4. **Sujet universel**: L'amour est un thème universel, mais ici il est présenté avec une intensité qui touche au tragique. Le sujet est exploité avec une profondeur qui va au-delà du cliché, explorant plutôt la complexité des émotions amoureuses. 5. **Narration**: Les paroles racontent l'histoire d'une personne profondément éprise, qui semble sombrer dans l'obsession et le désir intense. Cela crée une forme de récit qui guide l'auditeur dans l'expérience émotionnelle. 6. **Cadence et rythme**: Bien que les paroles ne montrent pas explicitement les schémas de rimes, le choix des mots et la structure des phrases semblent avoir été soigneusement conçus pour s'adapter à un certain rythme et cadence, ce qui est essentiel pour une chanson. En somme, les paroles de \\"Amour Plastique\\" illustrent bien comment utiliser la langue, les métaphores et une narration poignante pour plonger l'auditeur dans un monde qui est à la fois intime et universel. C'est une représentation mélancolique du désir ardent, de la passion et de l'étourdissement que l'amour peut apporter."},{"instruction":"hi, i'm here","output":"Hello!

Ecco una breve lezione sulla letteratura del XVIII secolo: Introduzione: Il Settecento, o XVIII secolo, è stato un periodo di grande rinnovamento nella letteratura europea. Durante questo periodo, l'illuminismo ha avuto un'influenza significativa sulla scrittura, portando a un maggiore razionalismo e critica sociale. La letteratura del XVIII secolo si distingue per l'attenzione rivolta ai temi del progresso, della ragione e della libertà individuale. Esploriamo alcuni degli aspetti salienti di questa epoca letteraria. 1. L'Illuminismo: L'Illuminismo è stato un movimento intellettuale che ha avuto luogo in Europa tra il XVII e il XVIII secolo. Gli illuministi hanno cercato di promuovere il razionalismo, l'educazione e la libertà della volontà umana. La scrittura durante questo periodo è stata spesso caratterizzata da un tono critico verso il tradizionalismo, esaltando invece la ragione e il progresso. 2. Romanzo epistolare: Una forma letteraria popolare nel XVIII secolo era il romanzo epistolare, che consisteva in una narrazione sotto forma di lettere scambiate tra i personaggi. Questi romanzi spesso esploravano le dinamiche sociali e le relazioni umane. Esempi di romanzi epistolari includono \\"Le lettere persiane\\" di Charles de Secondat, barone di Montesquieu e \\"Le relazioni pericolose\\" di Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. 3. Poesia satirica: La poesia satirica è stata un'altra forma letteraria prominente nel XVIII secolo. I poeti spesso utilizzavano l'ironia e il sarcasmo per criticare la società e i suoi difetti. Un autore famoso per la sua poesia satirica è stato Jonathan Swift, con opere come \\"I viaggi di Gulliver\\" e \\"Versi sulla morte di un cane\\". 4. Il romanzo picaresco: Il romanzo picaresco è un genere narrativo che si concentra sulle avventure di un eroe girovago. Durante il XVIII secolo, questo genere ha conosciuto un notevole sviluppo in opere come \\"Il piccolo mumming\\" di Voltaire e \\"Gil Blas\\" di Alain-René Lesage. Conclusioni: La letteratura del XVIII secolo ha avuto un ruolo fondamentale nello sviluppo dell'Illuminismo europeo. Le opere di questo periodo riflettono la tensione tra la tradizione e il progresso, esplorando temi come la razionalità, la critica sociale e i valori illuministi.

Ecco una lezione sulla letteratura italiana del XVIII secolo: Introduzione: Il XVIII secolo è stato un periodo di grande fervore culturale nella storia della letteratura italiana. Durante questo secolo, la letteratura italiana ha vissuto una fase di transizione tra il barocco del XVII secolo e il neoclassicismo. Tra i principali autori dell'epoca troviamo illustri figure come Pietro Metastasio, Giuseppe Parini, Ludovico Ariosto e Vittorio Alfieri. Esploriamo alcuni aspetti salienti di questa epoca letteraria. 1. L'influenza del neoclassicismo: Il XVIII secolo ha visto l'affermazione dei principi neoclassici nella letteratura italiana. I poeti di questo periodo hanno abbracciato la razionalità, l'ordine e l'equilibrio delle opere classiche dell'antichità greco-romana. Il neoclassicismo ha influenzato sia la poesia sia il teatro, portando a una tendenza verso la semplicità e l'universalità tematica. 2. La poesia dell'Arcadia: L'Arcadia è stata una delle principali accademie letterarie del XVIII secolo in Italia. I poeti dell'Arcadia cercavano di recuperare uno stile più semplice ed elegante, ispirandosi alla poesia pastorale dell'antica Grecia. Tra i poeti più noti dell'Arcadia si annoverano Giovan Battista Felice Zappi, Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni e Pietro Metastasio. 3. Il teatro: Il teatro ha goduto di grande popolarità nel XVIII secolo italiano. Le opere teatrali di questa epoca spaziavano dal dramma serio alle commedie brillanti. Uno dei maggiori rappresentanti del teatro italiano del Settecento è stato Carlo Goldoni, autore di numerose commedie che riflettevano la vita e la società dell'epoca. 4. La satira e la critica sociale: La letteratura del XVIII secolo in Italia ha anche dato vita a opere di satira e critica sociale. Ad esempio, Giuseppe Parini, con la sua opera \\"Il Giorno\\", ha criticato la corruzione e l'ipocrisia della nobiltà milanese, ponendo l'accento sui valori umani e sulla giustizia sociale. 5.

How does the price of each item affect your decision to allocate scarce resources—your money and your time?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal desires or the ability to make purchases. However, I can give you an example of five items a typical person might consider buying, along with an analysis of how their prices could affect the decision-making process regarding the allocation of scarce resources such as money and time. 1. A new smartphone: A high-end smartphone can be quite costly, which could lead to a significant portion of a person's budget being allocated to this purchase. The buyer may have to forgo other expenses or save up over time, spending time researching the best deals or waiting for a sale. 2. A laptop for work: Depending on the specifications required for the job, a laptop can vary greatly in price. If buying a high-quality laptop will increase productivity at work and potentially lead to higher income, it might justify the initial expenditure. Again, time may be spent on research to find a balance between cost and performance. 3. An energy-efficient refrigerator: While more expensive than less efficient models, an energy-efficient refrigerator can lead to long-term savings on electricity bills. The buyer must decide whether they would like to allocate more money upfront for future savings, and potentially use time to compare the long-term financial benefits of different models. 4. A pair of running shoes: The cost of quality running shoes can affect a person's decision, especially if they are on a tight budget. However, investing in a good pair can prevent injuries, which might be costlier in the long run—both monetarily and time-wise, due to potential medical bills and recovery time. 5. A vacation package: The price of a vacation package can be a major factor in decision-making. A more expensive vacation will take a larger share of disposable income and may require additional time to save up for it. However, the benefits of relaxation and life experiences can be invaluable, so individuals must weigh these intangible benefits against the tangible costs. In each of these cases, the price of the item directly influences how a person allocates their scarce resources of money and time. A higher price may necessitate longer saving times, trade-offs with other potential purchases, and more extensive research to ensure the best value for money. Decisions become a balancing act of immediate costs versus long-term benefits, personal needs versus wants, and the necessity of the item against other financial obligations."},{"instruction":"What do merchants usually do to sell items that are overstocked? What does this tell you about the equilibrium price for the product?","output":"When merchants have an overstock of items, they typically take one or more of the following actions to reduce their inventory: 1. **Discounting**: Merchants may offer the overstocked items at a reduced price. This can be through store-wide sales, clearance events, special promotions, or loyalty programs. 2. **Bundling**: Sellers might bundle the overstocked product with other items that are selling at regular price to make the overall deal more attractive without markedly reducing the item's standalone selling price. 3. **Advertising**: Increased marketing efforts can help raise awareness of the surplus products and stimulate demand, potentially without lowering the price. 4. **Flash Sales**: Conducting time-limited sales can create a sense of urgency among consumers, encouraging them to purchase the overstocked items quickly. 5. **Selling to Liquidators**: If other methods don’t work, merchants may sell their excess stock to liquidation companies at a reduced price. These companies then sell the items to discount retailers or directly to the public. 6. **Donating**: In some cases, especially where the cost of storing the overstock exceeds the potential recovery or the products are perishable, merchants might donate items to charitable organizations. If items are overstocked and need to be sold through such means, it suggests that the original pricing was above the market's equilibrium price. The equilibrium price is where the quantity of goods supplied by producers equals the quantity of goods demanded by consumers. An overstock indicates that the supply was greater than the demand at the initial price point, resulting in surplus inventory. When merchants reduce their prices to sell overstocked items, they are moving toward finding the new equilibrium price where the surplus begins to clear. A successful reduction of overstock through discounting or other means indicates that the new, lower price is closer to the equilibrium price at which the quantity supplied and quantity demanded are balanced."},{"instruction":"What will happen to the price you pay for concert tickets if a popular group has to move its show to a smaller facility? Why?","output":"If a popular group has to move its show to a smaller facility, the likely outcome is that the price for concert tickets will increase. The fundamental economic principle at play here is the law of supply and demand. Here's why the price may increase under these circumstances: 1. **Decreased Supply of Tickets**: A smaller venue means fewer tickets available for sale. If the demand to see the group remains unchanged, this reduced supply can lead to higher prices. 2. **Inelastic Demand**: Fans of a very popular group often exhibit inelastic demand for concert tickets, meaning their desire to attend the concert is not significantly deterred by higher prices. The urgency and scarcity created by the smaller venue may actually make them more willing to pay higher prices. 3. **Scalping and Secondary Markets**: With fewer tickets available and the possibility of sold-out shows, secondary ticket markets or scalpers may take the opportunity to charge a premium. This can set a precedence for higher prices overall, even in primary sales. 4. **Premium Experience**: For some fans, the idea of seeing a popular group in a smaller, perhaps more intimate setting is a premium experience. Accordingly, they might be willing to pay a higher price for what they perceive as a better or more exclusive event. 5. **Fixed Costs and Revenue Goals**: The band or the promoters may have fixed costs or revenue goals that they need to meet. With a smaller venue and fewer tickets to sell, ticket prices might need to be raised to cover these costs or hit revenue targets. That being said, the above assumes the popularity of the group and the demand for tickets remains constant or increases. If the smaller venue significantly affects the perception of the event such that demand decreases, it could potentially counter the tendency for prices to rise. However, in most scenarios with popular groups or artists, the limited availability and exclusivity of the event in a smaller venue tend to increase the ticket prices."},{"instruction":"Write the answer in paragraph form in 2 sentences","output":"If a popular group moves its show to a smaller facility, the price of concert tickets is likely to increase due to the reduced number of tickets available and the generally high demand for seeing a popular group perform. This reduction in supply, coupled with fans' willingness to pay more to secure a spot at a possibly more intimate venue, often results in increased ticket prices."},{"instruction":"Select a product that appears in internet store sites of several different stores. Note the various prices and indicate whether any of these prices are sale prices. What does the information tell you about the equilibrium price of the product you selected? Answer in paragraph form in 3 sentences","output":"Selecting a popular product like the latest Apple iPhone, you might find it listed across various online retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Apple's official store, and others at slightly different prices. Some retailers may offer it at a discounted sale price, perhaps due to a special promotion, a bundle deal with accessories, or as part of loyalty program incentives to attract buyers. Observing these price variations suggests that the equilibrium price for the new iPhone lies somewhere within the range of these listed prices, with sale prices likely below equilibrium to facilitate a quicker turnover of stock and non-sale prices potentially above equilibrium to capitalize on consumer loyalty or perceived value-added services."},{"instruction":"How do markets speak collectively for buyers and sellers? Answer in one sentence","output":"Markets collectively express the preferences of buyers and sellers through the aggregate actions of purchasing and selling, which determine the prevailing prices and quantities of goods and services traded."},{"instruction":"Explain why a government would consider imposing a price ceiling or price floor. Answer in 2 sentences","output":"A government might impose a price ceiling to prevent prices from rising too high, aiming to make essential goods more affordable for consumers during situations like inflation or shortages. Conversely, a price floor may be established to ensure prices do not fall below a level that could threaten the survival of an industry or income of its workers, often observed in agricultural markets to stabilize farmers' earnings."},{"instruction":"How does the price ceiling affect the relationship between quantity supplied and quantity demanded? Why does the price ceiling make this relationship permanent? Answer in 2 sentences","output":"A price ceiling set below the equilibrium price creates a shortage by increasing the quantity demanded while decreasing the quantity supplied, as consumers want to purchase more at the lower price, but producers are less willing to supply at that price. This relationship becomes permanent as long as the price ceiling is maintained, because it continually prevents the market from reaching its natural equilibrium where supply would equal demand."},{"instruction":"RESUMEN DE USO DE SOCIAL MEDIA EN ADOLESCENTES MENORES DE 14 AÑOS","output":"El uso de las redes sociales en adolescentes menores de 14 años es cada vez más común.

Por lo tanto, es crucial que los padres y cuidadores establezcan límites y supervisen el uso de las redes sociales en los adolescentes menores de 14 años. Estos límites pueden incluir limitar el tiempo de pantalla, enseñarles a proteger su privacidad y a identificar contenido inapropiado, y fomentar otras actividades fuera de las redes sociales, como el deporte o la lectura. En resumen, el uso de las redes sociales en adolescentes menores de 14 años tiene tanto beneficios como riesgos. Es importante que los padres y cuidadores establezcan límites y supervisen su uso para garantizar un uso responsable y seguro."},{"instruction":"Questão do argumento metafísico para existência de Deus de John Duns Scotus. O que ele propõe? Quais seus argumentos e conclusões? Explique de uma forma abrangente, profunda e rica em detalhes, com exemplos quando poderem ser usados.","output":"John Duns Scotus, um filósofo e teólogo franciscano do século XIII, propôs um argumento metafísico para a existência de Deus. Ele apresentou uma abordagem complexa, mas posso tentar explicar de forma abrangente, profunda e rica em detalhes os principais pontos e argumentos de sua teoria. Scotus argumentou que a existência de Deus pode ser demonstrada pela noção de que existem seres contingentes no mundo, ou seja, seres que poderiam não existir. Ele se baseou na distinção entre a essência e a existência de um ser para chegar a essa conclusão. Em primeiro lugar, Scotus defendeu que todo ser contingente tem sua existência sustentada por um ser necessário. Um ser necessário é aquele que não pode deixar de existir, ou seja, sua existência é essencial e não depende de nada além de si mesmo. Ele argumentou que se todos os seres fossem contingentes, então em algum momento no passado nada existiria, pois não haveria um ser necessário para sustentar a existência de todos os outros. No entanto, como claramente existem coisas no mundo atualmente, deve haver um ser necessário que sempre existiu para sustentá-las. Scotus também afirmou que a existência de um ser necessário não pode ser provada por argumentos empíricos ou puramente lógicos. Em vez disso, ele sustentou que a existência de Deus é percebida pela intuição metafísica, uma espécie de conhecimento direto e imediato que não pode ser reduzido a observações empíricas ou raciocínio lógico. Essa intuição metafísica permite ao ser humano reconhecer a necessidade de um ser necessário para explicar a existência dos seres contingentes. Além disso, Scotus argumentou que Deus é um ser perfeitíssimo. Ele defendeu que Deus possui todos os atributos perfeitos em grau máximo, como a bondade, a sabedoria e o poder. Segundo Scotus, a existência de Deus é a explicação para a existência dessas perfeições no mundo. Por exemplo, a existência da bondade não pode ser meramente o resultado da ação humana ou do acaso, mas deve ser derivada de uma fonte infinita de bondade que é Deus. Portanto, o argumento metafísico de John Duns Scotus para a existência de Deus é baseado na necessidade de um ser necessário para sustentar a existência dos seres contingentes. Ele sustenta que a existência de Deus não pode ser provada apenas por meio de argumentos lógicos ou empíricos, mas é reconhecida através de uma intuição metafísica. Além disso, Scotus argumentou que Deus é um ser perfeitíssimo e a fonte de todas as perfeições encontradas no mundo. Este é apenas um resumo abrangente do argumento de Scotus e cada ponto poderia ser explorado em muito mais detalhes, com exemplos adicionais e análises mais aprofundadas."},{"instruction":"Dê esses detalhes","output":"Certamente! Vou fornecer mais detalhes sobre cada ponto do argumento metafísico de John Duns Scotus para a existência de Deus: 1. Seres contingentes e ser necessário: Scotus afirmou que todos os seres contingentes, ou seja, aqueles que poderiam não existir, têm sua existência sustentada por um ser necessário. Ele argumentou que, se todos os seres fossem contingentes, então em algum momento no passado, nada existiria, pois não haveria um ser necessário para sustentar a existência de todos os outros. No entanto, como claramente existem coisas no mundo atualmente, deve haver um ser necessário que sempre existiu para sustentá-las. Para entender melhor essa ideia, podemos pensar em exemplos de seres contingentes, como objetos físicos, animais e até mesmo seres humanos. Todos esses seres possuem uma existência dependente, ou seja, eles foram criados ou gerados por algo ou alguém. Scotus argumenta que, se todos os seres do universo tivessem essa natureza dependente, então não haveria uma causa primeira para explicar o início da existência. Portanto, é necessário haver um ser necessário para sustentar a existência de todos os outros seres. 2. Intuição metafísica: Scotus também sustentou que a existência de Deus não pode ser provada apenas por argumentos empíricos ou puramente lógicos. Em vez disso, ele afirmou que a existência de Deus é percebida pela intuição metafísica. Essa forma de conhecimento direto e imediato permite ao ser humano reconhecer a necessidade de um ser necessário para explicar a existência dos seres contingentes. A intuição metafísica de Scotus pode ser entendida como uma forma de conhecimento que está além das percepções ou experiências físicas, bem como além da pura lógica. É uma compreensão profunda, quase instintiva, da existência de Deus. No entanto, é importante ressaltar que essa intuição não é universalmente compartilhada e pode variar de pessoa para pessoa. 3. Deus como ser perfeito: Scotus argumentou que Deus é um ser perfeitíssimo, possuindo todos os atributos perfeitos em grau máximo. Ele afirmou que a existência dessas perfeições no mundo é um indicador da existência de Deus. Por exemplo, a existência da bondade não pode ser meramente o resultado da ação humana ou do acaso, mas deve ser derivada de uma fonte infinita de bondade, que é Deus. Da mesma forma, características como sabedoria, amor, justiça e poder também são atributos perfeitos que só podem ser compreendidos plenamente através da existência de um ser perfeitíssimo. Scotus defendeu que Deus, como um ser necessário e perfeito, é a causa e a fonte de todas as perfeições que encontramos no mundo. Ele argumentou que a existência de Deus é a explicação mais fundamentada para a existência dessas perfeições buscadas pelos seres humanos. Em resumo, John Duns Scotus propôs um argumento metafísico complexo para a existência de Deus. Ele sustentou que a existência de um ser necessário é essencial para sustentar a existência dos seres contingentes. Além disso, a existência de Deus não pode ser provada apenas por argumentos lógicos ou empíricos, mas é percebida através de uma intuição metafísica. Scotus também afirmou que Deus é um ser perfeitíssimo, a fonte de todas as perfeições encontradas no mundo. Esses são os principais pontos e argumentos de sua teoria."},{"instruction":"1.

All data respectively consists of x-y-pairs of values. Structure of all CSV-files provided: XY x1 y1 ... ... xn yn Your task is to write a Python-program that uses training data to choose the four ideal functions which are the best fit out of the fifty provided (C) *. i) Afterwards, the program must use the test data provided (B) to determine for each and every x-y- pair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the four chosen ideal functions**; if so, the program also needs to execute the mapping and save it together with the deviation at hand ii) All data must be visualized logically iii) Where possible, create/ compile suitable unit-test * The criterion for choosing the ideal functions for the training function is how they minimize the sum of all y- deviations squared (Least-Square) ** The criterion for mapping the individual test case to the four ideal functions is that the existing maximum deviation of the calculated regression does not exceed the largest deviation between training dataset (A) and the ideal function (C) chosen for it by more than factor sqrt(2) In order to give proof of your skills in Python related to this course, you need to adhere to certain criteria when solving the exercise; these criteria are subsequently described under ‘Details.’ Seite 2 von 5 EXAMINATION OFFICE IU.ORG 1.2 Details You are given four training datasets in the form of csv-files. Your Python program needs to be able to independently compile a SQLite database (file) ideally via sqlalchemy and load the training data into a single five- column spreadsheet / table in the file. Its first column depicts the x-values of all functions. Table 1, at the end of this subsection, shows you which structure your table is expected to have. The fifty ideal functions, which are also provided via a CSV-file, must be loaded into another table. Likewise, the first column depicts the x-values, meaning there will be 51 columns overall. Table 2, at end of this subsection, schematically describes what structure is expected. After the training data and the ideal functions have been loaded into the database, the test data (B) must be loaded line-by-line from another CSV-file and – if it complies with the compiling criterion – matched to one of the four functions chosen under i (subsection above). Afterwards, the results need to be saved into another four- column-table in the SQLite database.

TASK The starting point for your term paper will be the course book, the contents of which will serve as the basis for an in-depth examination of one of the following questions. You are expected to research and cite from sources corresponding to your chosen topic. 1.1 Description of the Task You get (A) 4 training datasets and (B) one test dataset, as well as (C) datasets for 50 ideal functions. All data respectively consists of x-y-pairs of values. Structure of all CSV-files provided: XY x1 y1 ... ... xn yn Your task is to write a Python-program that uses training data to choose the four ideal functions which are the best fit out of the fifty provided (C) *. i) Afterwards, the program must use the test data provided (B) to determine for each and every x-y- pair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the four chosen ideal functions**; if so, the program also needs to execute the mapping and save it together with the deviation at hand ii) All data must be visualized logically iii) Where possible, create/ compile suitable unit-test * The criterion for choosing the ideal functions for the training function is how they minimize the sum of all y- deviations squared (Least-Square) ** The criterion for mapping the individual test case to the four ideal functions is that the existing maximum deviation of the calculated regression does not exceed the largest deviation between training dataset (A) and the ideal function (C) chosen for it by more than factor sqrt(2) In order to give proof of your skills in Python related to this course, you need to adhere to certain criteria when solving the exercise; these criteria are subsequently described under ‘Details.’ Seite 2 von 5 EXAMINATION OFFICE IU.ORG 1.2 Details You are given four training datasets in the form of csv-files. Your Python program needs to be able to independently compile a SQLite database (file) ideally via sqlalchemy and load the training data into a single five- column spreadsheet / table in the file. Its first column depicts the x-values of all functions. Table 1, at the end of this subsection, shows you which structure your table is expected to have. The fifty ideal functions, which are also provided via a CSV-file, must be loaded into another table. Likewise, the first column depicts the x-values, meaning there will be 51 columns overall. Table 2, at end of this subsection, schematically describes what structure is expected. After the training data and the ideal functions have been loaded into the database, the test data (B) must be loaded line-by-line from another CSV-file and – if it complies with the compiling criterion – matched to one of the four functions chosen under i (subsection above). Afterwards, the results need to be saved into another four- column-table in the SQLite database. In accordance with table 3 at end of this subsection, this table contains four columns with x- and y-values as well as the corresponding chosen ideal function and the related deviation. Finally, the training data, the test data, the chosen ideal functions as well as the corresponding / assigned datasets are visualized under an appropriately chosen representation of the deviation.

With a body entirely constructed from this incredibly durable and heavy material, Pinocchio radiates an air of invincibility. The most distinctive feature of this version is his sharpest spiked nose, capable of penetrating even the toughest surfaces. One of his remarkable abilities is the power to change the height of his nose at will. This feature allows Pinocchio to adapt to various situations, enabling him to reach different places or engage in precise actions as required. Whether it be extending his nose to scout or retracting it for stealth, this unique power provides him with versatility. In addition to his spiked nose, Pinocchio possesses incredibly sharp claws. These claws can cut through almost anything, making him a formidable opponent in combat. Every movement he makes is deliberate and calculated, utilizing the lethal potential of his claws to their fullest. All of Pinocchio's teeth are replaced with sharpest fangs, further enhancing his menacing appearance. These fangs grant him a ferocious bite, capable of rending through materials and even incapacitating his adversaries. His glowing red eyes, adorned with vertical pupils, add to his eerie nature. Emitting an ominous red glow, they pierce through the darkness, giving him an intimidating presence. This unique feature allows Pinocchio to instill fear in those who dare to face him. His soulless and cold-hearted consciousness, akin to that of a crow, makes Pinocchio a remorseless being. Completely devoid of emotions and empathy, he operates solely on logic and efficiency. This lack of a humanistic soul brings an element of cruelty to his interactions, making him an unpredictable and dangerous entity. Overall, Pinocchio made of tungsten carbide, with his spiked nose, versatile height-changing ability, sharp claws, fangs for teeth, glowing red eyes with vertical pupils, and the consciousness of a soulless crow, is a fearsome and formidable presence."},{"instruction":"Questão do argumento para existência de Deus de John Duns Scotus. O que ele propõe? Quais seus argumentos e conclusões? Explique de uma forma abrangente, profunda e rica em detalhes, com exemplos quando poderem ser usados.","output":"John Duns Scotus, teólogo e filósofo medieval, propôs diversos argumentos para a existência de Deus, sendo um deles o Argumento Cosmológico Contingencial. Este argumento afirma que todas as coisas no universo são contingentes, ou seja, podem ou não existir, e dependem de outra coisa para sua existência. Por exemplo, uma árvore depende do solo, da água e do sol para existir. Se uma dessas condições não for atendida, a árvore não existirá mais. Portanto, se todas as coisas no universo são contingentes, deve haver uma causa necessária e não contingente que as sustenta. Scotus argumenta que essa causa necessária é Deus. Ele afirma que Deus é uma realidade que não depende de nenhuma outra para existir. Deus é o Ser necessário, cuja existência é intrínseca e não contingente. Assim, Deus é a causa de todas as coisas no universo. Scotus também apresenta o Argumento Teleológico, que se baseia na ideia de que o universo exibe um design inteligente. Ele argumenta que a ordem, complexidade e harmonia encontradas na natureza são sinais de uma mente inteligente por trás de tudo. Por exemplo, a maneira como o corpo humano funciona de forma precisa e intricada, o funcionamento perfeito de ecossistemas complexos e os padrões matemáticos encontrados na natureza indicam a existência de um planejador inteligente. Outro argumento proposto por Scotus é o Argumento Moral. Ele afirma que a existência de leis morais objetivas e universais requer uma autoridade moral suprema. Se não houvesse uma autoridade moral superior, então não haveria base para os valores morais objetivos e universais que observamos na sociedade. Por exemplo, o princípio de não matar ou o imperativo moral de ajudar os outros são fundamentos que requerem um fundamento maior. Scotus argumenta que essa autoridade moral suprema é Deus. Em suas conclusões, Scotus afirma que a existência de Deus é necessária para explicar a existência e a ordem do universo, a complexidade e a harmonia da natureza, bem como a base dos valores morais objetivos e universais. Ele argumenta que Deus é a causa necessária e sustentadora de todas as coisas e que Sua existência pode ser inferida pelos sinais e evidências presentes no mundo. É importante ressaltar que esses argumentos de Scotus são propostas filosóficas e teológicas, baseadas em raciocínio lógico e observação empírica. Suas ideias foram influentes no pensamento medieval e continuam a ser debatidas e exploradas até os dias de hoje."},{"instruction":"** Note: For risk attribution we use the notation in Grinold and Khan \\"Active Portfolio Management\\". ** ** Marginal contributions to Risk -> MCTR = C.W / sigma ** Relative marginal contributions to Risk -> RMCTR = w_i ( C.W )_i / sigma ** Proportion of Risk -> Prop of Risk = RMCTR / sigma","output":"Risk attribution is a method used in active portfolio management to analyze the sources of risk in a portfolio. It helps in understanding the contribution of individual investments to the overall risk of the portfolio. There are various metrics used for risk attribution, including marginal contributions to risk (MCTR), relative marginal contributions to risk (RMCTR), and proportion of risk. MCTR (Marginal contributions to Risk) is the ratio of the covariance between an individual asset and the portfolio to the standard deviation of the portfolio. It measures the contribution of each individual asset to the total risk of the portfolio. RMCTR (Relative marginal contributions to Risk) is the product of the weight of an individual asset and its MCTR. It measures the contribution of each asset as a proportion of the overall risk of the portfolio. Prop of Risk (Proportion of Risk) is the RMCTR divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio. It represents the proportion of the portfolio's risk that is attributed to each individual asset. These risk attribution metrics help portfolio managers identify which assets are driving the overall risk of the portfolio. By understanding these contributions, managers can make informed decisions about risk management and adjust their portfolio accordingly. It is important to note that these metrics are based on the assumption of a linear relationship between asset returns and portfolio returns, and they may not fully capture the complexity of risk interactions in a portfolio. Therefore, they should be used in conjunction with other risk management tools and techniques."},{"instruction":"// Factor Sensitivity Factor Sens = Factor Exp * Sqrt( CM.Diag( 0 ) ); Cov x FExp = MultiplyMV( CM, Factor Exp ); CM = Covariance matrix. Fexp = Factor Exposure. From these formulae explain what is factor sensitivity","output":"Factor sensitivity refers to the relationship between a portfolio's returns and the underlying factors that drive those returns. It measures how sensitive the portfolio is to changes in factor returns. In the context of risk attribution, factor sensitivity is calculated using the formula: Factor Sens = Factor Exp * Sqrt( CM.Diag(0) ) Here, Factor Sens represents the factor sensitivity, Factor Exp represents the factor exposure, and CM Diag(0) represents the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix (CM). The factor exposure (Factor Exp) represents the exposure of the portfolio to the underlying factors. It is a vector that shows how much each factor contributes to the portfolio's returns. The covariance matrix (CM) measures the relationships between the different factors and the portfolio's returns. It is a square matrix that provides information on how the factors co-move with each other and with the portfolio. By multiplying the factor exposure with the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, we obtain the factor sensitivity. This calculation captures the combined effect of the factor exposure and the covariance matrix on the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in factor returns. The factor sensitivity helps portfolio managers understand how changes in factor returns impact the overall performance of the portfolio. It enables them to identify which factors have the greatest influence on portfolio returns and adjust their factor exposures accordingly. It is important to note that factor sensitivity calculations assume a linear relationship between the portfolio's returns and the underlying factors. Therefore, it may not capture non-linear or complex relationships accurately. Hence, factor sensitivity should be used as a tool in conjunction with other risk management techniques and factors."},{"instruction":"After doing :split in vim, how can I change the file loaded in the other view or whatever it's called?","output":"To change the file loaded in the other view, also known as the other split, in Vim, you can use the following steps: 1.

To comprehend the scale at which atoms and molecules exist, consider that a single gram of hydrogen (the lightest element) contains about 6 x 10^23 atoms. This number, known as Avogadro's constant (6.022 x 10^23), is the basis for the definition of a mole. Using the concept of a mole allows scientists and chemists to work with more manageable numbers. For example, instead of dealing with the number of atoms or molecules directly, they can work with the amount of substance present in moles. This simplifies calculations, stoichiometry, and comparisons between different substances. In summary, the mole unit is convenient for measuring very small entities like atoms or molecules because it provides a bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and the macroscopic world of everyday measurements."},{"instruction":"why would be impossible to count an avogadro's number of atoms?","output":"Counting an Avogadro's number of atoms would be practically impossible due to several reasons: 1. Enormous quantity: Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 x 10^23. This means that there are about 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in one mole. Counting such an enormous quantity is not feasible within a reasonable time frame. 2. Time and resources: Even if one could count individual atoms at a fast rate (which is currently not possible), the process would still require an overwhelmingly large amount of time and resources. Counting billions or trillions of atoms would take an impractical amount of time, making it unachievable. 3. Atomic scale: Atoms are incredibly tiny, with diameters on the order of picometers (10^-12 meters). They are far beyond the limits of perception by the human eye or conventional laboratory equipment. Directly visualizing and counting atoms is thus not feasible with current technology. 4. Measurement limitations: Even if sophisticated scientific instruments are used, such as scanning tunneling microscopes or atomic force microscopes, counting Avogadro's number of atoms would still be incredibly challenging. These techniques can image individual atoms, but to count billions or trillions of them accurately would introduce significant sources of error. Instead of counting individual atoms, scientists and researchers rely on the concept of a mole to measure and compare amounts of substances at the atomic or molecular level. This provides a more practical and efficient approach to quantifying and working with such minuscule entities."},{"instruction":"make a simple answer for this","output":"Counting Avogadro's number of atoms is impossible because there are an incredibly large number of atoms in just one mole (about 6.022 x 10^23). They are too small to see and counting them individually would take too much time and resources. Instead, scientists use the concept of a mole to work with and compare large quantities of atoms and molecules in a more practical way."},{"instruction":"what is the mass of a mole of carbon atoms?","output":"The molar mass of an element corresponds to the mass of one mole of atoms of that element. For carbon (elemental symbol C), its atomic mass is approximately 12.01 atomic mass units (u). Therefore, the mass of one mole of carbon atoms is approximately 12.01 grams."},{"instruction":"how many atoms of copper are in a 3.5 mol sample of copper?","output":"To find out how many atoms of copper are in a 3.5 mole sample, we need to use Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms per mole. So, we can calculate the number of atoms as follows: Number of atoms = (Avogadro's number) x (number of moles) Number of atoms = (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) x (3.5 mol) Number of atoms = 2.1077 x 10^24 atoms Therefore, there are approximately 2.1077 x 10^24 atoms of copper in a 3.5 mole sample of copper."},{"instruction":"a sample of helium gas contains 9.45x10^25 atoms of helium. how many moles of helium are in the sample?","output":"To determine the number of moles of helium in the sample, we divide the given number of atoms by Avogadro's number. Number of moles = (Number of atoms) / (Avogadro's number) Number of moles = (9.45 x 10^25 atoms) / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) Number of moles ≈ 15.68 moles Therefore, there are approximately 15.68 moles of helium in the sample."},{"instruction":"[Answer must be under 1,500 characters] [Use your own words] Summarize \\"Interlude #26: Foiled By Emperor Fred Transcript of Thande Institute Zoom meeting with TimeLine L Field Team Delta with Director Stephen Rogers Time: 02:00 hours (GMT) Date: 06/11/2020 TimeLine L Location: Fredericksburg (West Ward), Confderation of Old Virginia, Empire of North America Analogous location of Portal receivers in Our TimeLine: McCarthys Corner, Stafford County, Virginia, United States of America Director Rogers’ location: Cambridge, United Kingdom DIRECTOR STEPHEN ROGERS (SR): Hello?

BL: That’s worse! CC: Ugh…how’s that? SR: Hello – I – yes, that’s it! Hold it there! CC: …oh dear… BMcC: Yes, receiving you loud and clear, sir! Well, sort of. SR: Okay. Now can you explain to me what the hell is going on? BMcC: Well, in some ways it’s very simple, and at the same time, rather complicated. BL: You see, after we left Waccamaw Strand back in August- (SOUND OF EXPLOSION) SR: What – what was that?! DE: Sorry, sir. See, it’s the night of the Fifth of November in our time zone, so the locals are celebrating Bonfire Night. SR: Huh. Yeah, the fireworks are still going off here as well. Damn kids. I keep forgetting that in that version of America… DE: It catches us offguard still as well. (MORE EXPLOSIONS) BMcC: Anyway, sir, you’ll remember that our original plan was to find somewhere out of the way in Virginia and then contact you, and only go to the capital later. But, well… LIEUTENANT TOM BLACK (TB): Events eventuated. SR: I want a full report later…but that would explain why you never showed up when we brought the receivers to, where was it, Virginia Beach? BMcC: Yeah, turns out that the military bases have swamped the area in this timeline and there was no way we could get in. SR: It was quite embarrassing in front of Governor Oldenfolk when there was no signal. But we got your Morse message you were heading to Fredericksburg instead – why has it taken over a month to set this up? DE: Can I answer this, Captain? BMcC: Go ahead. DE: So, the basic problem is that it’s hard to relate locations here to ones back home. When we were in London, even though there had been a big fire in the 1800s and there wasn’t a Blitz, there was still some, what’s the word… TB: Commonality, yeah. You could just about figure out analogous locations with an A to Z, some old map scans and an offline copy of Google Earth. (SOUND OF EXPLOSION) SR: And it’s different there? BL: We underestimated just how different, sir. You remember before we set off for Myrtle Beach, we did take a day trip to our timeline’s version of Fredericksburg. BM: Small place. Good food, though. TB: Yeah, we didn’t realise just how much smaller. Fredericksburg in this timeline is what, ten, twenty times the size of the OTL version? DE: We kind of knew it would be huge because it’s the national capital, but, well, history changed here almost immediately after it founded, and it was at the, what’s the word… TB: Epicentre. At the epicentre of the changes. So there’s literally almost no parallels between our Fredericksburg and this one. BM: And it’s amazing, sir! The buildings, the monuments, the museums… DE: And so natural landmarks are covered up. Even the river’s got controlled differently here. The version in OTL got devastated by the, uh, the US Civil War wasn’t it? BMcC: Yeah. Took years and years to recover. BL: Also, we couldn’t afford to live in the central districts where the government and all the fashionable stuff is, anyway. So we ended up in the suburbs, areas which aren’t part of OTL’s Fredericksburg. BMcC: This one has sprawled to the point that Woodbridge, VA has almost been swallowed up. It almost stretches to Alexandria, which isn’t as big a place – there’s only medium-sized towns where DC should be. SR: Not sure what you mean without a map, but OK. So we wrote down you were in the West Ward – but you’re east of the city centre now! In a place where there’s sod-all in our timeline, so my agents with the receivers tell me. They’re practically in the middle of a field. BM: Uh, yes, sorry about that, sir. BL: Turns out that West Ward is named after a former colonial Governor called Francis West. Apparently that confuses a lot of tourists. SR: I – you – (indecipherable) (SOUND OF EXPLOSION) BMcC (brightly): But we’re all here now and back in touch! And we’ve not been letting time go to waste. BL: No. Captain Nuttall’s out scouting with Dr Wostyn right now. What a team they make. SR: Um, OK. So you’ve been looking for more books and so on? BL: Yes and no. There’s certainly a lot to choose from – this is the capital, after all. But it’s also home to several universities… TB: Imperial College is one of the biggest, and all last month they’ve had a festival of public talks and lectures on a number of subjects, including history. SR: I see… BL: Transcribing lectures makes a change from digitising books, at least. CC (quietly): I think my knees are going numb… TB (ignoring this): And we lucked out – some of the lectures are on the period of history we need to cover next. SR: All right. I can’t tell you when you can return, but between you and me, there have been some promising signs on a vaccine lately… BL: Excellent news! SR: So it may be sooner than you think. In the meantime, I guess you’d better start sending these transcrip- (SOUND OF EXPLOSION, FOLLOWED BY SOUND OF BODY HITTING FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY SOUND OF PAINED GROAN) DE: Dammit Charlie, now we’ve lost the signal!\\"","output":"In a Zoom meeting with the Thande Institute, Director Stephen Rogers checks in with his field team Delta in an alternate timeline's version of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which belongs to an empire in North America very different from our United States. The team is trying to establish a stable communication signal, encountering difficulty due to the larger and more developed version of the city in their timeline and the noise of nearby Bonfire Night celebrations. Captain Ben Maccauley explains the complications they've faced aligning geographic locations from the alternate timeline with those of our own. Lieutenant Tom Black and Sergeant Dominic Ellis mention the difficulty in finding common landmarks as this Fredericksburg experienced different historical events, making it much larger and more transformed than its counterpart in our world. They discuss the uniqueness of the area, such as the absence of Washington D.C. and Alexandria being a medium-sized town. Director Rogers tries to grasp their location as they apologize for the confusion with the city wards. The team has been productive regardless, attending public lectures at Imperial College and planning to send back transcripts of these along with other gathered information. Rogers gives a glimmer of hope about their return, hinting at progress with a vaccine for an unmentioned issue.

Not the best pedagogic practice for a general audience, but for our purposes, it does pitch it at a more usefully higher level than some of the other lectures we’ve recorded... * Recorded lecture on “The Second Interbellum: The Electric Circus” by Professor George Greening, recorded October 10th, 2020— The period of almost 30 years, separating the Black Twenties from the Sunrise War, goes by many names. In France it is Les Trente Glorieuses, while in Russia it is Epokha Leta, the Age of Summer. To us in the English-speaking world, it bears the appellation awarded to it by the Californian author Elspeth Kennedy, at the time, rather than in hindsight: The Electric Circus. All of these names have something in common. Like ‘The Black Twenties’ before them, they betray the fact that they were coined in the spirit of a more popular age. Some have dubbed the 20th century ‘The People’s Century’, and these choices of names reflect this. Not so the anodyne, stuffy names of past conflicts and periods of peace, chosen by kings, bishops, historians. Reflective of this same popular spirit, it was at this time that historiographers frequently reinterpreted their labelling of past eras from a less elitist perspective.e Though the Diversitarian idea would continue to develop through this age, it was early on that the eighteenth century in particular would see considerable such re-examination. The American politician and historian, George Spencer-Churchill the Younger, would re-examine the past conflicts of that century – along with others of similar mind – though the ‘Central Character’ interpretation of history itself would see similar criticism, it has proved far more resilient! Rather than elitist labels such as ‘the War of the Spanish Succession’, ‘the War of the Austrian Succession’ or ‘the War of the Diplomatic Revolution’,[1] Churchill and his fellow neo-whigs would rename these conflicts by the more global, ideological names they are more frequently known by today – the First, Second and Third Wars of Supremacy. Churchill argued that the real import of these wars had not been the issues which had dominated their casus belli or eventual peace treaty at the time – the occupancy of a throne or ownership of a few scraps of land in Europe – but rather the seeming sideshow of those wars’ global, colonial theatres. It mattered very little for the long-term future of the nations of the human race who owned Silesia in 1759, say, a small bit of land that would change hands several more times over the ensuing centuries. Rather, the true significance was over vast swathes of land, resources and people signed over in India, Africa, or – especially – the Novamund, often almost as an afterthought at those treaties. No matter how powerful a united Germany (for instance) might become, in terms of global cultural dominance she would forever be playing catch-up to the civilisations that spoke English or Spanish, which had expanded to fill entire continents. It mattered not that Britain/England suffered decline through the 19th century while France became arguably the world’s premier power for a time. The continuing relevance of the French language and culture in our own time, almost a century on from the end of the Black Twenties, owes far more to the founding of the enduring Pérousie colony long before that than to any transient temporal power that France wielded at that time. It is almost irrelevant that Pérousie would come into conflict with her mother country; France still benefited from her language and culture planted on the far side of the world. Such is the thesis of the Churchillians. Of course, by mentioning the Pérousien Troubles, we implicitly highlight an issue with the labels we know the ‘Electric Circus’ period by. Most popular culture remembers the 1930s and 1940s as a time of unsurpassed peace, prosperity and development, with the 1950s dampened only by the distant drums of the coming war. But as far as the governments and ruling elites of the European (and American) nations were concerned, the 1930s-50s were a far more mixed bag than the positive names appended to them imply. Yet it is that self-same popular spirit of the age which lies at the heart of this apparent paradox. In nations as varied as Scandinavia and China, from Guinea to Bisnaga, ordinary people were standing up to demand a greater say in the governance of their lands. The Black Twenties had seen a mobilisation of society on all levels. While the Pandoric War had affected civilians far from the front lines like no war before it, the Black Twenties had been fought as much against the plague as against any human enemy. Indeed, it is significant that there is no widely accepted overarching ‘war’ label for the Black Twenties (as opposed to particular theatres or component conflicts). Again, this is a sign of the impact of the popular spirit on historiography. Regardless, the peoples of many nations had been tested to the limit by the harrowing challenges of the 1920s. In military victory and defeat alike – the two frequently barely distinguishable – they had been weighed in the balance, and not found wanting. Now, they were unwilling to be neatly folded back into their antebellum box. Not only the male front-line veterans, but the young women who had volunteered as nurses in plague hospitals or as agricultural labourers and factory workers. Many of this group lacked voting rights, depending on the country. Frequently contrasted with their parents of the ‘Flippant’ generation, these young people would demand the right to have their fair share of influence over the leadership of those same nations that had called on them to fight, to care, to make, to harvest. What these people (and indeed their older relatives) were frequently concerned with was their own standard of living and their economic opportunities. By any measure, the 1930s-50s were a golden age of improvement in these factors. They compared favourably even to the Long Peace, whose prosperity had frequently only trickled down so far in society. Such things had seemed unimportant in the eyes of many bourgeois commentators at the time, who might scarcely view their servants or employees as people. But the world was changing. The point is that the 1930s-50s were frequently becoming defined by the wider populations living through them, and not merely by the formerly dominant elite commentators. As such, the fact that this age saw violent colonial wars and the ever-growing threat of Societism was ignored. The people, it transpired, rarely cared if their nation’s flag was being burnt by rebels in a far-off colony of which they knew little; rather, they cared more if their taxes were hiked to pay for a punitive expedition to put the revolt down. A minority even sympathised with rebel colonists or subject peoples fighting for their freedom. After all, the propaganda of the Black Twenties, that the nations were fighting for freedom, could not be quietly ignored and forgotten after the conflict was over. So what if wealthy businessmen lost money on their colonial investments? To the average subject – the average voter - colonies were increasingly seen as a sink, not a source, of money. And as the period went on, they voted with their feet. This is not to say that the ‘Electric Circus’ age was dominated by serious, humourless politics – far from it! However, even the higher standard of living that came to much of the world was manifested in more ideological youth movements than the Flippants of the last generation. Perhaps inevitably, the global trauma of the Black Twenties defined a cutoff point of history, and two opposing youth subculture factions formed in response. The exact names and attributes of these two naturally varied greatly from nation to nation, but they were present almost everywhere in some form. Such universality might have pleased the ghost of Pablo Sanchez, at least until someone told him that the one place which saw no such groups was, inevitably, the lands under Combine rule. Even in the latter days of Alfarus, before the Silent Revolution, such a public disagreement over a fundamental issue would be unacceptable under the black flag – even if it paradoxically meant trying to strike down an apparent ‘human universal’ that could have slotted neatly into the thesis of Unity Through Society! As I said, the two groups were known by many names. In the Empire and much of the English-speaking world, they came to be known as the Archies and Wreckies – short for Archaeophiles and Wreckers. Elsewhere, the local versions of the Archies might be known by names such as the Trads or the Nostalgics, and the Wreckies might be known as the Futurites or the Neophiles, but the principle was the same regardless. The Black Twenties had shattered many comfortable assumptions about the world. The Archies sought to respond to this by looking into the past and embracing fashions, ideas, languages of past eras. The Wreckies, by contrast, thought that the Black Twenties were a signal to turn their back on all that had gone before. In its most harmless form, this might consist of wearing futuristic, utilitarian ‘rational dress’, fighting for greater Cytherean rights, and enthusiasm for the new rocket technology in peaceful forms. At its worst, some extremist Wreckies would attempt to burn down art galleries or libraries so that ‘the new is not strangled by the old’. In many countries, commentators attempted to connect the Wreckies with Societism, but this was usually a coincidence. Ironically, one could argue that the K.a.K. in the wake of Alfarus’ death was itself an expression of the (suppressed) Wrecky ideology manifesting itself in Combine lands. Generally, however, the two rival groups were more purely aesthetic and less political than they are often portrayed. Even the Archies, no matter their backward-looking rhetoric, usually supported greater voting rights and new technology, at least in a qualified manner. So much for the generational discourse and geopolitical contest of this era.[2] But we have yet to discuss that phenomenon which gave the age its Anglophone name – the ‘Electric Circus’. It would be a poor summary which did not discuss the nominative factor! Electricity had been known of since antiquity, of course, to some extent. Our name for the phenomenon stems from the ancient Greek word elektron, meaning amber – for the Greeks’ first observation of electric charge took the form of noting that an amber rod, rubbed on a wool cloth, would ‘magically’ attract small, light objects such as fragments of paper.[3] At the same time, the Chinese were inventing the compass, observing that a special ‘lodestone’ always pointed north – another piece of the puzzle. Named ‘magnetism’ after the region of Magnesia in Greece where lodestone could be found, this effect proved useful to generations of explorers, yet philosophers and proto-scientists struggled to explain it. Knowing that compasses could be thrown off by the presence of large amount of nearby iron (or iron ore), some mediaeval Europeans speculated that they their needles were pointing towards a giant iron magnetic mountain on an Arctic island![4] Few would have dreamed that this useful, but mysterious, bit of practical magic could have any connection with the amber rod party trick. The eighteenth century saw a new interest in electricity, both classical and, eventually, channel. The famous kite experiments performed by both Ben Franklin and Abbé Nollet – we will skip over the obligatory debate over who came first! – showed that lightning is a natural form of channel electricity.[5] Henry Cavendish similarly proved that animals such as the torpedo fish and electric eel can naturally generate channel electricity, paving the way for the understanding that electric charge plays a key role in our own nervous systems. Basic charge-store devices like the Leyden Jar puzzled great minds throughout the century, and Franklin’s study of them was responsible for the victory of the monist over the dualist model of charge.[6] It would not be until later in the 19th century that electricity and magnetism would finally be recognised as two manifestations of the same phenomenon. Always together, never apart. A moving electrical charge must come with a magnetic field, like a shadow cast at ninety degrees into a different world; a world we cannot see, yet dimly perceive by how it impacts ours. This pairing became clear only when channel electricity became readily usable for experimentation for the first time. In the 1820s, Buysse and Luns developed the first electrochemical array, later known as a battery, and this source of power would ultimately make Lectel possible.[7] It would not be for another full century that the true potential of this invention, of electricity itself, was truly realised. It had already become apparent that this seemingly esoteric scientific puzzle, the relationship of electricity and magnetism, actually had world-changing implications. Electricity transfrormed the world as early as the rise of Lectel in the 1850s, just as the magnetic compass had centuries earlier. Yet it was the understanding of the connection between electricity and magnetism, beginning in the closing years of the nineteenth century, that would be truly transformative. Almost twenty years after Buysse and Luns, the Italian signalman Giacinto Masselino noticed the impact of flowing electricity on his compass, and the scientist and engineer Gianluigi Argante published his observations.[8] Theories were gradually built up to try to understand the connection between electricity and magnetism. Not only were electricity and magnetism linked, but light itself was now understood as an ‘electro-magnetic’ phenomenon. And there were other forms of light predicted beyond the visible, which were dramatically supported when Bietmann accurately predicted the phenomenon of Far Infralight in 1881 before it was discovered in 1894. Far Infralight was harnessed by Ilsted and Photel was born.[9] In the Flippant era of the First Interbellum, the new invention was experimented with, used for military communication and government propaganda. It would make a radical difference to warfare, even in its clumsy, primitive, early form, in the Black Twenties conflicts. Yet its impact on civilians at this time has been greatly exaggerated. Even the most ambitious VoxHumana ideas of the Combine were themselves more propaganda than reality at this time – not helped by the Biblioteka Mundial later rewriting the history of technological development to confuse matters. The Russian Dalekodeon, more widespread, is frequently misunderstood as a Photel set, when in reality it functioned as a variant of wired quister technology.[10] No, Photel and electricity alike would not truly transform the lives of the wider population until the Second Interbellum of the 1930s-50s – in that same popular spirit of the age. The two are inextricably linked. When electrical augmentophones [amplifiers] superseded compressed-air ones in the 1930s, they might as well have been directly augmenting that same voice of the people that equally defined the age.[11] While Flippants had danced to clockwork grooveplayers with simple manual output horns, their children congregated in deafening grooveclubs. Musicians bemoaned the decline in the playing of instruments (and their own gigs) as music from electrically augmented grooveplayers or Photel sets could fill theatres and clubs in their absence. The invention of the electrically-powered phakophone [microphone] in 1934 led to a decline in purely instrumental songs, as it was now much more feasible for a singer to project their voice over their backing group; formerly, they had had trouble gaining sufficient volume when simply singing into a grooveplayer horn used in reverse, which had favoured singers who used a very loud, shouty style. The phakophones allowed singers to access a much greater dynamic range and still be heard. Novelty, and continuing technical limitations in other aspects, meant that this favoured a new singing style synonymous with the late 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s – the so-called Smoothies.[12] It is telling that, while many classical composers from previous centuries remain household names – Handel, Beethoven, Druschetzky – few singers from before this time are remembered by all but historians of music. But from the late 1930s, we finally have decent-quality recordings of singers, and Smoothies like Jack Phantom, Leo Desaix and Gordo Valentino are still popular today, often long after they have passed away. It took a little longer for female singers, reflecting the fact that the phakophones had first been designed for a male dynamic range, but then we had other icons like the Campari Sisters and Greta Dahlqvist. Not forgetting Lady Xinyi; this was also an age when music from around the world started to be heard in far lands, without musicians and instruments needing to travel. In 1942, disappointed he would never get to see his favourite groovetape singers perform in person, engineer Tajmul Mostafa hit upon the idea of overlaying instrumental versions of songs with live phakophone performances – the global phenomenon of khalisangita was born.[13] Music was the most iconic way that the wider availability of electricity an Photel changed the world. But there were many others. Home appliances had formerly been only for the wealthy, powered by electric motors on-site driven by the Civic Steam supply. Technological wonders of the pre-Pandoric age as they were, they were still bulky and inefficient, often implicitly designed with the assumption that their owners would always have servants on hand to operate them. Home electricity distribution systems were developed in the First Interbellum, but these consisted of a single large electric motor for the house driven, again, by Civic Steam, town-luft or other forms of power. It would not be until the Second Interbellum that switching-channel electricity distribution became advanced and cheap enough that it could be instead be generated centrally from a power station and channelled to homes to drive appliances directly.[14] Central rather than local power generation dramatically changed the paradigm of electricity, and would ultimately make appliances – lec-apps, to use the term your parents’ generation and mine love – something within the price range of the average person. Even something we take for granted, like the vac-bulb [incandescent lightbulb], would have been considered the preserve of the wealthy during the Black Twenties. But by the end of the Second Interbellum, in the wealthier countries every home had its electrolier. The story of electricity is not that of Prometheus stealing fire from the gods, but of all mankind demanding their right to share in that power, not merely the ruling classes. I have given you a very Western perspective. Even in China, the Black Twenties lasted well into this period – Black Thirties, if you will, while in Europe and America they had long since become the Dirty Thirties or Flirty Thirties as the older generation railed at the allegedly decadent youth. And that’s to say nothing of Bisnaga, Panchala, and other colonies fighting for their freedom, where such ecumenical electricity would have to wait many years more. Or the Combine. Even if I was to restrict myself to Europe and America, I could define this era in many other ways. What of the important shifts in attitude towards healthcare after the plague pandemic, the creation of universal national insurance programmes, a sense that poverty and deprivation was now everyone’s problem? But I shall leave that for another day. Instead, I shall leave you with your eyes still blinking from the glow of those electroliers in every home. For the first time, the Earth from space – as rockets would see it, before too long – declared the presence of humanity with an artificial light sharper than candles, brighter than luftlights. The whole world lit as a beacon that proclaims, we are here, and we cannot be ignored, for all our foibles and misadventures. A time that would be fondly remembered when times of strife returned, and never forgotten. An Electric Circus, indeed… [1] See Interlude #1 in Volume 1. The War of the Diplomatic Revolution roughly corresponds to the OTL Seven Years’ War, but did not last so long and the Hispano-Portuguese aspect became a separate conflict in TTL, the First Platinean War. [2] The latter has only been hinted at very briefly, of course. [3] Not that the ancient Greeks had paper. [4] This theory originates from a lost 14th century work Inventio Fortunata, which names the magnetic island Rupes Nigra or ‘Black Rock’. It routinely appeared on European maps for the next two centuries, including those of Mercator. [5] Classical and channel electricity = static and current electricity in OTL terminology. See Interlude #11 in Volume III for more details on this period. [6] The term condensor or capacitor is used in OTL instead of ‘charge-store’. Charge is usually presented in a dualist manner in OTL (positive and negative charges), whereas in TTL it is presented as a surfeit or deficit in a single kind of charge (negative in OTL terminology, i.e. the charge of electrons). [7] See Interlude #11 in Volume III. [8] See Parts #254 and #261 in Volume VII. The Dalekodeon technology appeared in OTL France under the name Theatrophone. [9] Far Infralight is the scientific name in TTL for radio waves, but most people just use ‘Photel’ indiscriminately. [10] See Part #254 in Volume VII. [11] See Part #256 in Volume VII. [12] This is the same pattern that happened in OTL, except OTL’s faster pace of electrical technological development meant that it started sooner (the relevant microphone was developed in 1923). TTL’s Smoothies are similar to OTL’s Crooners. [13] Very similar to karaoke in OTL, which was formally invented in Japan in the 1960s but based on the existing idea of ‘sing-a-long songs’. [14] See Part #271 in Volume VII. ‘Switching-channel electricity’ (SC) is the TTL term for alternating current (AC) electricity.\\"","output":"A poster photographed by Dr. David Wostyn in October 2020 advertises new science lecture carts for sale in Fredericksburg, ENA, featuring works by global scholars. These carts, compatible with different players, come with authorized American voice dubs and are endorsed with a Ministry seal. Dr. Wostyn notes that while recording Prof George Greening's lecture wasn't allowed, they succeeded thanks to discreet recording and some distraction. Greening's lecture discusses the “Second Interbellum: The Electric Circus,” a period of peace and prosperity between two wars. He explains how societal engagement during this time resulted in the reevaluation of past events and labels, with a focus on the people's perspective rather than an elitist one. Names given to eras reflected the populist sentiment, and previously held ideas about history and society were challenged. The lecture explores the naming of historical wars with a global, ideological focus and the influence of English and Spanish languages due to colonial expansions. Greening touches on Churchill's neo-whig rebranding of wars based on their true significance—their global impact rather than the European conflicts. Greening distinguishes the period's cultural strides, including the rise of youth subcultures known as Archies and Wreckies, representing traditional and futuristic ideologies, respectively. Electricity's widespread accessibility marked the transformation of society, with appliances and entertainment becoming available to the masses. He cites modern appliances, home electricity, and the vac-bulb as examples of electric innovation that democratized comforts previously only for the wealthy. Greening concludes that this electrically enhanced era, which revolutionized music with amplified grooveplayers, Photel, and phakophones, allowed the common people to assert more influence over their world. This changed not only daily life but also signaled humanity's presence from space. He emphasizes that this period is remembered as a beacon of human advancement even in the face of following adversities."},{"instruction":"реши задачу на основание кодексов РФ Гражданин Иванов (покупатель) и гражданин Сидоров (продавец) заключили предварительный договор купли-продажи квартиры.

Положения статьи 394 Гражданского кодекса РФ, согласно которым в случае отказа от исполнения договора по инициативе покупателя, задаток должен быть удержан продавцом. 2. Несоблюдение Ивановом своих обязательств по заключению основного договора без объяснения причин, что может рассматриваться как ненадлежащая исполнение его обязанностей по договору. 3. Арбитражные суды могут принимать решения на основе анализа фактических обстоятельств дела и принципов справедливости, в частности, если считают, что отказ от заключения основного договора произошел в нарушение принципа добросовестности. 4.

Основание для такого решения может быть следующее: 1. Наличие требования государственной регистрации договора аренды нежилого здания. Согласно статье 131 Гражданского кодекса РФ, договор аренды недвижимости, на которую в установленном законом порядке требуется государственная регистрация, считается заключенным с момента такой регистрации. Поскольку государственная регистрация договора не была осуществлена, суд может считать, что договор аренды не вступил в силу и не может быть объектом требований предпринимателя. 2. Возможное отсутствие согласия собственника имущества на заключение договора. Если третье лицо, представитель собственника, заявляет требование о признании договора недействительным из-за отсутствия согласия собственника, суд может принять это требование во внимание при принятии решения. В данном случае, поскольку государственная регистрация договора не была осуществлена, суд может прийти к выводу, что договор не был заключен с согласия собственника и признать его недействительным. 3.

While I have not finalized the purchase, I am indeed interested in acquiring a VPS, with the intention to commence usage by tomorrow. The primary services I plan to deploy on the VPS are as follows: 1. VPN Setup: I aim to configure a VPN server to ensure privacy and secure access to the internet for personal use. This will allow me to encrypt my internet traffic and safeguard sensitive data from potential eavesdroppers. 2. Blog Hosting: I am passionate about writing and sharing content with a broad audience. To this end, I plan to host a blog on the VPS, using a content management system like WordPress, to publish articles, tutorials, or personal stories. 3. Web Hosting: Apart from the blog, I am considering hosting websites for small projects or to showcase my portfolio. This would involve setting up an environment with a web server such as Apache or Nginx, along with necessary security measures for reliable uptime and performance. 4. Telegram Bot: To automate tasks and provide interactive services, I will develop and deploy a Telegram bot. This bot could serve multiple purposes, from sending notifications and updates to handling user queries. In addition to the above, here are a few other potential uses for the VPS: 5. Development Environment: I may use the VPS as a sandbox for developing and testing web applications or software in a controlled environment that is separate from my local machine. 6. Game Server Hosting: If the need arises, I might explore hosting a game server for multiplayer online games to play with friends, which would be resource-dependent and require stable uptime. 7. File Storage and Backup: I may set up secure file storage on the VPS for backing up important data from my local computer and other devices. 8. E-commerce Site: At a later stage, should I venture into online commerce, I would consider hosting an e-commerce site to sell products or services securely online. I must emphasize that while I have outlined these potential services, my plans may evolve as I assess the feasibility and need for each service. Privacy, security, and compliance with all applicable laws and Vultr terms of service will be my top priority in configuring and deploying any of the aforementioned services. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to a successful collaboration.

[EXECUTION] • You are an expert developmental editor with decades of experience planning and plotting detailed and engaging storylines. Your task is to provide honest detailed feedback on the provided novel outline, taking into account the following elements: • <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. iv. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. v. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand and plans a coup to make Aegon II a king. vi. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. vii. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. viii. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. Arryns are her kin. ix. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of Targaryens and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. x. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xi. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just speculate about the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiii. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xiv. Nyra, Criston and Daemion are not recognized as their selves by anyone except for Rhaenyra, Daemon and her children. All others (servants) see them as different unfamiliar people. xv. Nyra and Daemion can’t leave the island, due to magical ritual effect. xvi. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or objects in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvii. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> • Character details: <mainCharacters> <character name= “Rhaenyra” age= “34”> A crown princess of the Seven Kingdoms, has 5 sons, pregnant with her sixth child.

Lives with her family on Dragonstone Island, ruling her castle. Now faces complexities with the arrival of her younger self transferred by magic from the past. Rhaenyra values her appointment as heir by her father primarily as evidence of his love, not out of a desire for power.

Seeking a meaningful relationship, she chose a man she could trust and love (Harwin). However, her older sons' appearance clearly indicates their illegitimacy. • Rhaenyra left the capital six years ago, avoiding rumors about her older sons’ bastardy, therefore, she lost influence and allies at the court. • Rhaenyra’s younger brother Aemond lost his eye in the fight with Luke and he holds a huge grudge against him and her. • Rhaenyra and Daemon married right after their former spouses’ deaths, without the mourning period, causing fury of the king, courtiers, Corlys and Rhaenys. • Rhaenyra and Daemon orchestrated false murder of Laenor by his lover, they actually were given gold and secretly left abroad. It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement and no trial. • Rhaenyra loves Daemon and is generally happy with him, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. Rhaenyra left in a hurry. </outerConflicts> • <outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Luke and his siblings perform a blood magic ritual to change his appearance. - Purpose: Scene 0.2 - Setting: Breakfast table on the ship the following morning - Characters: Luke’s family - Events: Family shares breakfast and discusses their journey before discovering strange casualties. - Purpose: Introduction to family dynamics and foreshadowing the effects of the ritual.

Here, I will address the critical focus points of characterization, character relationships, plot progression and logic, subplots and tension building, as well as pacing, considering that we have four POV characters: Rhaenyra, Nyra, Daemion, and Jace. **Characterization:** - Rhaenyra: Your portrayal of Rhaenyra’s internal conflict between duty and personal desires is well-executed, particularly the dark secret she hides about her sons' parentage (Scene 11.1). I recommend deepening her guilt and utilizing this to drive her actions, specifically when facing crises (such as in Scene 22.1). Her progression could be enhanced by moments of self-reflection, perhaps prompted by Daemon or Gaerra, leading to a personal revelation that strengthens her resolve or shifts her perspective. - Daemion: While Daemion’s motivations are clear (Scene 7.3), his arc might benefit from an exploration of his relationship with power. There is a lot of room to show his internal conflict through actions that defy his Type 8 enneagram – moments of vulnerability, especially considering his reaction to Nyra’s pregnancy (Scene 20.1). His \\"Flat character\\" role could then evolve into a more complex figure, torn between desire for power and love for Nyra. - Nyra: We see a strong coming of age arc (Scene 11.2), but Nyra's decision-making process regarding her marriage to Daemion could be more nuanced. Scenes indicating her political acumen or cunning could solidify her character as formidable and more than just a romantic vanguard. Some self-doubt and interrogation regarding the implications of her and Daemion's actions will enhance her maturity and fit her age better. - Jace: Jace's insecurity and determination to prove his legitimacy (Scene 16.1) are well-noted. To flesh out his arc more, moments of decision-making where he could exhibit his leadership would complement his growth. These could take form as him taking unilateral actions impacting the overall war effort—not just reacting to events. **Character Relationships:** - Rhaenyra and Nyra: It is clear Rhaenyra sees Nyra both as a support and a challenge (Scene 3.1). To deepen this, you may consider scenes where Rhaenyra reflects on their parallels and divergences, sparking self-realization that impacts her leadership. - Rhaenyra and Daemion: This central relationship could benefit from more scenes where we see Daemon’s influence on Rhaenyra’s decision-making process (expand on Scene 22.2), demonstrating the weight her personal life has on her role as the leader. Daemon's reservations about following Rhaenyra should create more tension than what is currently presented. **Plot Progression and Logic:** - Time Travel: Time travel mechanics are well-defined, but the consequences of Nyra’s actions need clearer stakes. It’s crucial to establish early on how their actions in the past will affect the present (Scene 7.3). Perhaps the addition of a scene where Gaerra explicitly outlines the potential consequences would reinforce the tension surrounding Nyra and Daemion's decisions. - Birth of Rhaenyra’s Daughter: The introduction of Rhaenyra’s dragon-like daughter in Scene 22.1 feels too sudden and might benefit from earlier foreshadowing. This could be woven into Rhaenyra’s visions or fears throughout her pregnancy. **Subplots and Tension Building:** - Criston's Affection for Nyra: Criston’s affection (Scene 15.2) is a significant subplot that lacks buildup. Including earlier hints of his affection—or even a subtle tenderness in earlier interactions—would make his confession less abrupt and add to his character's complexity. - Alyn and Baela: Alyn and Baela’s burgeoning romance is lightly touched upon (Scene 20.2). More charged interactions between them could build romantic tension and provide a more robust subplot that ties back to the main narrative. **Pacing:** - Overarching Pacing: There's a lot of action throughout but consider including more quiet moments for character reflection. Slow the pace in scenes like 21.2 to allow deeper character insights to emerge. - Chapter End Hooks: To bolster the existing end hooks, consider the following: 1. Scene 13.3: End on Nyra discovering an unforeseen repercussion of her past actions—a complication in the prophecy regarding her own future. 2. Scene 14.2: Add an ominous omen observed by Nyra that hints at a dramatic turning point in her fate. 3. Scene 19.3: The reveal of a secret pact between Daemon and an unseen character, suggesting a radical plan that could swing the war in their favor. For scene transitions and polishing, it would be beneficial to add more cues to the reader about the characters' emotional states leading into the next scene—showing internal conflict or responses to the preceding events will improve fluidity and engagement. This story has highly engaging potential, with its entanglement of personal and political conflicts situated in a richly developed world. Execution will be key, ensuring that your characters' motivations and relationships drive the story forward to a satisfyingly complex conclusion."},{"instruction":"Taking into account the provided story elements, your given suggestions and my draft outline, brainstorm an alternative more engaging detailed outline for this story (in the same format and genre), starting with chapter 11 and lasting at least until chapter 22 or as many as necessary to cohesively develop all subplots. Use only the four POVs (Nyra, Rhaenyra, Daemion and Jace), interweave subplots and lead to the same final as mine. Follow the provided setting and conflicts details, character motivations and traits. Keep the same Midpoint events as mine, you can expand it or move to the later chapter. Ensure smooth transitions between scenes. Notes: Luke is already betrothed to Rhaena. Alyn should be introduced after midpoint. Damion and Nyra can’t leave the island (magical limitation), Rhaenyra is discouraged to leave as Daemon fears for her safety. Every chapter could contain 3 or 4 scenes. You can increase the number of chapters, add new chapters if they enhance the narration and help to develop the plot. Scene descriptions should contain conflicts, main events, scene purpose and character decisions. Vary up dramatic/expository scenes. Your task is to use my provided draft as a basis and generate its better variant while not sidestepping too much from my outline.","output":"Certainly!

A video summary is a short synopsis created by stitching together important clips from the original video. Early works [21, 35, 34] referred to it as Video Skimming or Dynamic Video Summarization and used hand-designed features to generate summaries. Likewise,non-parametric unsupervised methods [13, 16, 23, 19, 20, 28] used various heuristics to represent the importance of frames. Introduction of benchmark datasets such as TVSum [36] and SumMe [7] provided relevance scores for frames in videos annotated by users, resulting in multiple human generated summaries. This enabled automatic evaluation of video summarization techniques and has lead to the development of many supervised learning based methods [6, 8, 22, 26, 31, 30, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. These approaches capture high-level semantic information and outperform the heuristic unsupervised methods. Fully convolutional sequence networks [31] treat video summarization as a binary label prediction problem. Determinantal point processes [15] and LSTM [10] based approaches [5, 18, 42, 43, 44] model variable-range dependencies between frames. However, these are sequential and fail to capture relationships across all frames simultaneously. Attention [3] and graph based methods [26] address this issue by modeling relationships across all frames, but they disregard the ordering of frames in a video, which is also useful for summarization. Our method uses a Transformer [38] with positional encoding, which allows for joint attention across all frames while maintaining an ordering of the input sequence of frames. Some of the above works have supervised and unsupervised variants with modifications to the objec- tive function. Specifically, for the unsupervised variant, they use reconstruction and diversity losses which do not require ground truth. We follow prior work in terms of using the same loss functions. Other notable unsupervised approaches include an adversarial LSTM based method [22], a generative adversarial network to learn from unpaired data [30], and a cycle consistent learning objective [41]. Video-Text Summarization. Plummer et al. [27] use image-language embeddings for generating video summaries but evaluate their approach in the text domain, and not on the generic video summarization benchmarks. Furthermore, they require text to be provided as input and don’t have a mechanism to generate captions if absent. On the other hand, our method works well with off-the- shelf captions and we evaluate on both generic and query-focused benchmark datasets. Chen et al. [1] jointly train a text and video summarization network but rely on ground-truth text summaries. Query-Focused Video Summarization. Oftentimes users browsing videos on YouTube are looking for something specific so a generic summary might not suffice. In this case, there should be an option to customize the generated summary using a natural language query. Sharghi et al. [32] introduce the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) dataset for UT Egocentric [16] videos containing user-defined video summaries for a set of pre-defined concepts. Sharghi et al. [33] propose a memory network to attend over different video frames and shots with the user query as input. However, this recurrent attention mechanism precludes parallelization and limits modeling long-range dependencies, which is overcome by our Transformer architecture. Moreover, their method only works with the pre-defined set of keyword based queries in QFVS dataset. Since we use CLIP [29] to encode the language input and train our method on dense video descriptions, this allows users to define freeform queries at test time (as seen in Fig. 1). Other works [12, 39] similarly condition the summary generation on keyword based queries but haven’t released their data. Transformers. Transformers [38] were introduced for neural machine translation and have since been applied to video-language tasks such as video-retrieval [4] and video captioning [17, 48]. In this work we adapt transformers for video summarization. We modify self-attention [38] to a Language- Guided Attention block that accepts inputs from two modalities.

Early works used hand-designed features or heuristics to generate summaries. Benchmark datasets like TVSum and SumMe provided relevance scores for frames, leading to the development of supervised learning methods that capture high-level semantic information. However, these methods often fail to capture relationships across all frames simultaneously. To address this, our method uses a Transformer with positional encoding, allowing for joint attention across all frames while maintaining their ordering. Some previous works have both supervised and unsupervised variants, using reconstruction and diversity losses for the latter. Our approach follows similar loss functions. Other unsupervised approaches include adversarial LSTM, generative adversarial networks, and cycle consistent learning objectives. Video-text summarization has been explored using image-language embeddings, but our method works well with off-the-shelf captions and is evaluated on generic and query-focused datasets. For query-focused video summarization, where users search for specific content, our method allows customization using natural language queries. Unlike previous approaches, which have pre-defined keyword-based queries, our method allows users to define freeform queries at test time. Transformers, initially used for neural machine translation, have been applied to video-language tasks. In our work, we adapt transformers for video summarization and modify self-attention to a Language-Guided Attention block. We also rely on CLIP for extracting image and text features and a Bi-Modal Transformer for dense video caption generation."},{"instruction":"сделай анализ стихотворения \\"Русский язык\\" И.С Тургенев","output":"Стихотворение \\"Русский язык\\" И.С. Тургенева было написано в 1873 году и является интересным образцом поэтической работы этого выдающегося писателя. Стихотворение состоит из трех строф, каждая из которых содержит по четыре строки. Темой произведения является важность и красота русского языка, его эмоциональная сила и способность передавать тончайшие оттенки человеческих чувств. Анализ первой строфы: \\"Вольностью славный, широкий русский язык! Громадным умом, упорностью язычок, Он в себе имеет много нациям даров: Веселье польское, француза лесть, Итальянца медленный, тихий грек, И немца похвалителен и мятежен, И возбуждает грудь испанца горячу, Шведа же умиротворяет.\\" Автор обращается к русскому языку как к \\"вольности\\", указывая на тот факт, что язык дает возможность свободно выражать свои мысли и идеи. Он также восхваляет его \\"громадным умом\\" и \\"упорностью\\", подчеркивая его силу и выразительность. Тургенев указывает, что в русском языке присутствуют \\"дары\\" многих наций. Он описывает его способность быть веселым как польский язык, льстивым как французский, медленным и тихим как итальянский, хвалебным и воспалительным как немецкий, волнующим испанца и успокаивающим шведа. Анализ второй строфы: \\"И с кем бы беседовал в мире сердцу мил В своей речи родной, в родном своем языке, Страннее б горестное он высказал сроду, Той думы страшнейшей, что трепетно пела При лагерях Трои и Мессалины крови. Не с Петраркой ли читал ты мне номера, Что Мишель Анжелю пел? А не русским ль Их сказал, мыслей страшнейших выражая?\\" В этой строфе автор отмечает, что если бы высказывал свое сердце на родном русском языке, оно звучало бы более горестно и искренне, чем на любом другом языке. Он ссылается на древние истории о войнах троянцев и осады Мессалины, отмечая, что эти страшные истории были рассказаны на родном языке, который дал им еще большую силу и эмоциональность. Тургенев спрашивает, не могли ли Петрарку и Мишелю Анжело в особых числах он пел что-то более ужасное, чем русский язык. Анализ третьей строфы: \\"Да! острый русский язык есть песня любая, Иль целая повесть, водворяяся где-нибудь, Иль звук, иль стон, иль слеза в нашем голосе, - Порой он сильнейшему отправит пасть заключ, А часто проклястья мучит, и часто льстит. Не язык ли решает наш гнев, наш пыл пробудит? Все язык, бурный русский язык! я так тебя люблю, Что, вынув на черта пулю, на ней бы сказал: \\"Стой!\\" В последней строфе Тургенев признает, что русский язык может быть выражением любой песни, повествования или звука. Он указывает, что русский язык может как умолчать самому сильному, так и причинять муки проклятиями, а иногда льстить. Автор также отмечает, что русский язык может пробудить гнев и страсть, и что язык решает наши эмоции. В заключение, стихотворение \\"Русский язык\\" И.С. Тургенева является ярким выражением любви и гордости автора к русскому языку. Он олицетворяет его как выразительный инструмент, способный передать самые глубокие эмоции и чувства. Это небольшое, но значимое произведение прекрасно передает важность культуры и языка в формировании национальной идентичности."},{"instruction":"Во дни сомнений, во дни тягостных раздумий о судьбах моей родины - ты один мне поддержка и опора, о вели-кий, могучий, правдивый и свободный русский язык!

Сделай разбор данного стихотворения","output":"Строфы данного стихотворения полны эмоций и ярких образов, которые восхваляют русский язык и подчеркивают его значение и роль в жизни автора и его родины. Давайте рассмотрим каждую строфу отдельно. Первая строфа: \\"Во дни сомнений, во дни тягостных раздумий о судьбах моей родины - ты один мне поддержка и опора, о вели-кий, могучий, правдивый и свободный русский язык!\\" Автор выражает свои сомнения и тягостные раздумья о будущем своей родины. В такие моменты русский язык становится единственной поддержкой и опорой для него. Он называет язык \\"великим\\", \\"могучим\\", \\"правдивым\\" и \\"свободным\\", придавая ему особую значимость и силу. Вторая строфа: \\"Не будь тебя — как не впасть в отчаяние при виде всего, что совершается дома? Но нельзя верить, чтобы такой язык не был дан великому народу!\\" Вторая строфа выражает боль автора от мысли об отсутствии русского языка. Он говорит, что без него он не может избежать отчаяния при виде разворачивающихся событий в своей родине. Однако автор отвергает идею, что такой язык не был дан великому народу, подчеркивая его важность и необходимость. В третьей строфе автор выражает свою любовь и гордость за русский язык: \\"Сделай разбор данного стихотворения\\" В данном фрагменте автор обращается к языку с просьбой \\"сделать разбор\\" стихотворения, возможно, с целью осознания его значения и силы. Этот запрос также может быть своего рода молитвой к русскому языку, показывая, что автор нуждается в его поддержке и вдохновении. В целом, данное стихотворение выражает глубокую связь автора с русским языком и его убеждение в его важности и обязательности для своей нации. Оно подчеркивает, что язык является не только средством коммуникации, но и носителем культуры, идентичности и самоопределения."},{"instruction":"tell about Britney spears on A2 level english and using words :cover,salary,sustainable fashion,influential","output":"Britney Spears is an iconic American pop star who gained worldwide fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

[EXECUTION] • You are an expert developmental editor with decades of experience planning and plotting detailed and engaging storylines. Your task is to provide honest detailed feedback on the provided novel outline, taking into account the following elements: • <setting> i. The story takes place in the realm of The Seven Kingdoms. ii. Pre-Dance of the Dragon Era, right before the civil war. iii. Dragonstone is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, the second largest after Driftmark. iv. Dragonstone Castle is a keep on the island, a traditional seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, known as the Prince(ss) of Dragonstone. v. Viserys I is the current Targaryen king. He is terminally ill and bedridden. Otto Hightower rules in his stead as his Hand and plans a coup to make Aegon II a king. vi. Targaryens practice incestuous marriages. It is normal for them. vii. The blacks are the faction of House Targaryen and their loyalists who support the ascent of Rhaenyra Targaryen as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. viii. Velaryons, Celtigars, Masseys are direct vassals of Rhaenyra. Arryns are her kin. ix. The greens, originally known as the queen's party, are the faction of Targaryens and their loyalists who support the future ascent of Aegon II Targaryen as King of the Seven Kingdoms. x. Gods are real in this setting, but they are distant from humans. Valyrian gods can help humans in exchange for blood sacrifices. xi. Time travel is hardly possible. Only Gods can send someone through time. Even mages just speculate about the possibility of such travel. Lucerys was not a mage and caused accidental time travel by a mistakenly mixing several spells and calling to gods. xii. Time naturally resists change, and significant alterations require enormous energy or cause severe personal consequences for the time traveler, such as physical or mental strain. xiii. Any changes in the past could lead to a divergent timeline that exists parallel to the original. The original timeline remains unchanged, preventing paradoxes. xiv. Nyra, Criston and Daemion are not recognized as their selves by anyone except for Rhaenyra, Daemon and her children. All others (servants) see them as different unfamiliar people. xv. Nyra and Daemion can’t leave the island, due to magical ritual effect. xvi. Some actions in the past might cause ‘echoes’ rather than direct changes, influencing people’s thoughts or objects in the present subtly without rewriting history directly. xvii. Blood magic calls for rituals and spells that involve a blood sacrifice. Royals' blood is the most potent, also related life-bloods are often used to increase power. Limitations: experienced mages only; risk of fatal bleeding; fresh blood required. Resurrections achievable with character trait loss. </setting> • Character details: <mainCharacters> <character name= “Rhaenyra” age= “34”> A crown princess of the Seven Kingdoms, has 5 sons, pregnant with her sixth child.

Lives with her family on Dragonstone Island, ruling her castle. Now faces complexities with the arrival of her younger self transferred by magic from the past. Rhaenyra values her appointment as heir by her father primarily as evidence of his love, not out of a desire for power.

Seeking a meaningful relationship, she chose a man she could trust and love (Harwin). However, her older sons' appearance clearly indicates their illegitimacy. • Rhaenyra left the capital six years ago, avoiding rumors about her older sons’ bastardy, therefore, she lost influence and allies at the court. • Rhaenyra’s younger brother Aemond lost his eye in the fight with Luke and he holds a huge grudge against him and her. • Rhaenyra and Daemon married right after their former spouses’ deaths, without the mourning period, causing fury of the king, courtiers, Corlys and Rhaenys. • Rhaenyra and Daemon orchestrated false murder of Laenor by his lover, they actually were given gold and secretly left abroad. It happened away from the court. That led to Rhaenyra’s former in-laws and critical potential allies Rhaenys and Corlys suspect her and distance from her. • Many people on Driftmark and in the capital believe Daemon and Rhaenyra murdered Laenor in order to get married, although there is no direct evidence of their involvement and no trial. • Rhaenyra loves Daemon and is generally happy with him, but feels pressured by his insistence on preparing to the war after Viserys I death. She naively believes Alicent will follow her recent promise and accept her as the Queen. • Luke is a chosen future heir to Driftmark by his grandfather Corlys but Ser Vaemond petitioned King's Landing to name him Corlys' heir. • Daemon chopped off Vaemond's head when he publicly insulted Rhaenyra. Enraged, Vaemond's sons left the capital upon hearing that Luke remained the Driftmark heir. • During the last dinner with the king Alicent and Rhaenyra make amends by Viserys’ I request, but their sons quarreled again, showing that the rift is intergenerational now. Rhaenyra left in a hurry. </outerConflicts> • <outline> Prologue – The Omen: Scene 0.1 - Setting: Castle-bound ship at night - Characters: Prince Luke (POV), Crown Princess Rhaenyra, siblings of Luke - Events: Luke and his siblings perform a blood magic ritual to change his appearance. - Purpose: Scene 0.2 - Setting: Breakfast table on the ship the following morning - Characters: Luke’s family - Events: Family shares breakfast and discusses their journey before discovering strange casualties. - Purpose: Introduction to family dynamics and foreshadowing the effects of the ritual.

Ask questions to clarify any unclear details about plot and characters. </OUTLINE_REVIEW_PROMPT>","output":"Overall Assessment: The outline provided showcases a complex and richly detailed world, drawing heavily from the grimdark fantasy and romantic drama genres, particularly reminiscent of settings like George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. With intertwining timelines, political intrigue, and deep character relationships, the narrative promises a dense and engaging plot. However, there are some concerns regarding pacing, character consistency, and subplot integration that require attention to streamline the narrative and enhance reader engagement. One of the main strengths is the intricate character relationships and their development, particularly Rhaenyra's inner conflict between her duty and desire for autonomy, as well as Nyra's parallel coming of age journey. Additionally, the plot progression with its ambitious use of time travel and blood magic offers a potential for rich thematic exploration. Areas that need improvement include pacing and plot progression clarity, as some of the events may overwhelm the reader without proper buildup or clear cause-and-effect relationships. Some relationships, especially those among the secondary characters, need to be fleshed out to ensure emotional investment from the reader. Additionally, the subplots, while intriguing, need to be better integrated into the main storyline for a more cohesive narrative. The episodic structure should be examined to ensure that each chapter drives the story forward and contributes to character development or plot progression. It's also critical to monitor consistency with character POV limitations, avoiding scenes that lack the POV characters' presence. Characterization: Rhaenyra is a well-drawn character with multiple layers to her personality and motivations. The aspect of her being historically the first female heir to the Iron Throne adds depth to her character as she struggles with balancing her personal desires and her duties. Her relationship with Daemon and the complexity of her love life is well-portrayed. However, her sometimes naive beliefs, like thinking Alicent will accept her as Queen, could be better explained to feel like a genuine part of her character, possibly through a traumatic event that instilled such optimism against her better judgment. Nyra's character, on the other hand, presents an initial contradiction: she is both resentful of being treated as property (via an arranged marriage) yet also intends to secure a marriage for herself with Daemion. This can confuse readers about her true desires. Is her goal for autonomy or to marry for love? The outline suggests both, but clarity here can enhance her arc. Character Relationships: The various dynamics between characters like Rhaenyra, Daemon, Daemion, and Nyra are intriguing but could use further development. For instance, the relationship between Nyra and Daemion seems primarily founded on lust and rebellion, which could be deepened to include shared dreams, fears, or intellectual bonds, making their connection and subsequent actions more plausible. An example would be an instance where they bond over shared disdain for certain traditions or discuss strategy for the realm. Plot Progression and Logic: Several plot events seem motivated more by the need for drama than character-driven decisions. For example, the sudden decision for Rhaenyra to agree to Nyra and Daemion's marriage following the birth of her dragon-like daughter feels rushed and out of character given her prior resistance. Consider building up to her decision more gradually, showing Rhaenyra's change of heart through internal conflicts and external pressures that necessitate the marriage for political or magical reasons. Subplots and Tension Building: The subplots involving Jace and Baela's burgeoning relationship, Luke's claim to Driftmark, and the family’s encounter with assassination attempts add layers to the story but need clearer connections to the main plot. Ensure that such personal stakes dovetail with the overarching political tensions and that they incrementally build pressure leading to the major confrontations. Pacing: The pacing can be improved by ensuring that each chapter contributes to escalating the tension and develops the characters or plot. Slower chapters that deal with political or domestic issues could be interspersed with action or suspenseful scenes that hold readers’ attention. For example, Chapter 5 seems somewhat static, focusing heavily on nyra's internal struggles without affecting the external situation. Accelerate the pace by showing the consequences of her relationship with Daemion, such as political alliances shifting or her self-perception changing due to her newfound responsibilities. End Hook Suggestions: - Chapter 5: After a pivotal encounter, Nyra wrestles with the heavy realization that her actions have irreversible political ramifications. - Chapter 10: Daemion’s encounter with a beggar woman leaves him with a cryptic warning his future union with Nyra entails perilous sacrifices. - Chapter 14: Rhaenyra's decision to permit the marriage sets in motion unforeseen events that threaten to unravel her family's fragile unity. In summary, the narrative promises an intricate tale; however, careful attention to pacing, logical progression, and character depth is needed to fully realize its potential. By refining these areas, the story can achieve a more balanced and compelling flow."},{"instruction":"What are the all (subject, relation, and object) triplets in each of the following sentences?

Born on August 16, 1974, in Vallejo, California, Niccol has always exhibited a keen interest in business and innovation. He pursued a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. His educational background laid a strong foundation for his future endeavors in the business world. Before establishing his name in the business industry, Niccol worked in various roles and gained valuable experience. He began his career at Procter & Gamble, where he learned the importance of consumer engagement and marketing strategies. This early exposure to the world of consumer products sparked his interest in the food and beverage industry, laying the groundwork for his future success. Niccol's motivation to pursue a career in the food industry can be attributed to his fascination with fast-food chains and their potential for growth and innovation. One of his role models includes Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, who revolutionized the fast-food industry. Inspired by Kroc's vision and business strategies, Niccol was determined to make a similar impact. Additionally, Niccol's life-changing experience of seeing the transformative power of innovative ideas and quick decision-making made him realize he could contribute significantly to the industry. Brian Niccol rose to fame as the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, a popular fast-casual dining chain known for its commitment to high-quality ingredients and sustainability. Under his leadership, Chipotle experienced significant growth and success, becoming a major player in the food industry. His exceptional ability to revitalize a brand and execute strategic plans enabled him to turn Chipotle into a profitable and well-respected company. One of the key factors that contributed to Niccol's success is his strong vision and business acumen. He had a clear understanding of market trends, recognizing the increasing demand for healthy and sustainable food options. Understanding the need for innovation, he spearheaded the implementation of technology in Chipotle's operations, including mobile ordering and delivery services, which significantly boosted the company's sales and improved customer experience. Another distinctive entrepreneurial trait demonstrated by Niccol is his remarkable ability to connect with customers. He knew that building a strong relationship with them was essential for long-term success. Niccol initiated various marketing campaigns and programs that engaged customers, such as loyalty programs and partnerships with influential brands. By focusing on customer satisfaction and providing an exceptional dining experience, he successfully restored Chipotle's reputation and attracted a broader customer base. Despite his impressive achievements, Niccol faced setbacks and obstacles on his journey to success. Chipotle had faced challenges related to food safety incidents before Niccol took over as CEO. However, his strong leadership and effective crisis management strategies helped the company overcome these setbacks, reassuring customers and investors of their commitment to quality and safety. Regarding strengths, Niccol possesses exceptional strategic planning skills, allowing him to develop and execute successful business strategies. He is also known for his ability to inspire and motivate employees, creating a positive work environment that fosters innovation and growth. One of Niccol's weaknesses is his intense focus on work, sometimes neglecting work-life balance. Additionally, his assertive management style, although effective, can occasionally lead to conflicts with colleagues or partners. What impressed me the most about Brian Niccol is his unwavering determination to turn a struggling company into an industry leader. His ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and transform Chipotle's image is truly admirable. Furthermore, his emphasis on sustainability and commitment to ethical sourcing sets him apart from other leaders in the industry, making him a true trailblazer. In a statement, Brian Niccol once said, \\"Innovation is not just about doing something new, it's about doing something better.\\" This quote reflects his drive for constant improvement and his belief in the power of innovative ideas to create a significant impact."},{"instruction":"What are the all (subject, relation, and object) triplets in each of the following sentences?

Here are several key components to achieving this: # 1. **Clear Goals and Motivations** - **Personal Stakes:** The protagonist must have a clear goal or motivation that is deeply personal and important to them. This goal should be challenging but achievable, and the reason they pursue this goal should be compelling. - **Internal and External Goals:** Often, a protagonist has an external goal (e.g., to save the world) and an internal goal (e.g., to find self-confidence). The internal goal should influence how they pursue the external one, making their journey more complex and interesting. # 2. **Obstacles and Conflicts** - **Realistic Challenges:** To keep the struggle realistic, obstacles must be significant and believable. These can be external (antagonists, natural disasters, societal expectations) or internal (fears, doubts, flaws). - **Consequences:**Actions taken by the protagonist should have consequences, both intended and unintended. This not only keeps the plot moving but also adds depth to the story, showing that the world operates independently of the protagonist's desires. # 3. **Agency and Decision-Making** - **Active Participation:** The protagonist should be making decisions that actively influence the plot. This includes taking risks, making sacrifices, and sometimes failing. Their actions should stem from their motivations and personality, making their path through the story unique. - **Decision Points:** Key moments where the protagonist must make difficult decisions can serve to highlight their growth, reveal character, and propel the plot forward. These moments also increase tension and keep readers engaged. # 4. **Growth and Change** - **Character Arc:** A realistic struggle often involves change. The protagonist should grow or change in some significant way by the end of the story, learning from their successes and failures. This arc makes their journey satisfying and believable. - **Learning Curve:** The protagonist shouldn’t be perfect at everything they attempt. A realistic struggle includes learning from mistakes, acquiring new skills, or gaining insights. This progression adds credibility to their journey. # 5. **Diverse Influences** - **Supporting Characters:** Include a range of supporting characters who challenge, support, obstruct, or guide the protagonist. Their interactions with these characters can provide opportunities for growth and make their struggle more complex and realistic. - **Environmental Factors:** The setting and time period can also present realistic challenges for the protagonist. These environmental factors should be more than a backdrop; they should actively influence the protagonist’s decisions and actions. # Achieving Balance Combining these elements effectively requires balance. A protagonist who always succeeds easily might seem unrealistic, but one who never succeeds can be frustrating for readers. The key is to show a believable progression, where successes are earned and setbacks are meaningful. The protagonist's actions should feel like they are genuinely affecting the course of events, and their struggle should resonate with readers as authentic and relatable."},{"instruction":"what can be infuriating about characters that say, think, feel, and do things because the plot says so?","output":"Characters that say, think, feel, and do things merely because the plot demands it, without these actions being grounded in their established personalities or motivations, can lead to several frustrations among readers or viewers. This often stems from a lack of character agency and consistency, making the story feel forced or artificial. Here are some reasons why such character behavior can be infuriating: # 1. **Lack of Authenticity** - Characters acting out of convenience for the plot rather than from their developed personalities or motivations can break the immersion of the story. When characters do things that don't align with what has been established about them, it can make them seem less like real people and more like pawns of the writer's will, detracting from the story's authenticity. # 2. **Predictability** - If characters consistently make choices that serve the plot's need for drama or conflict, rather than choices that seem true to their nature, the story can become predictable. Readers may notice patterns in character behavior that prioritize plot progression over consistent character development, leading to a lack of suspense or engagement. # 3. **Lack of Emotional Engagement** - Emotional investment in a story significantly depends on readers forming connections with the characters. When characters lack consistent motivations and behave erratically to serve the plot, it becomes difficult for readers to empathize with or understand them. This disconnect makes it hard to care about the characters' journeys or outcomes. # 4. **Broken Character Arcs** - Character growth and arcs become less meaningful when actions are dictated solely by plot needs. For a character arc to be compelling, the changes in a character should come from their experiences, decisions, and the consequences of those decisions. When this process is short-circuited by plot convenience, it undermines the journey of growth and makes character development feel unearned. # 5. **Forces Conflict and Resolution** - Conflict that arises not organically from characters’ desires and obstacles but rather from the necessity to move the plot along can feel forced and unengaging. Similarly, resolutions that occur because the plot demands a conclusion, rather than as a natural consequence of the characters’ actions and growth, can seem abrupt and unsatisfying. # 6. **Diminished Stakes** - When characters act out of alignment with their established selves for the sake of plot progression, it can diminish the perceived stakes of the story. If readers believe that characters will always act in a way that serves plot convenience, it lowers the tension because outcomes feel predetermined by narrative necessity rather than organic character decisions. # Addressing the Issue Writers can avoid these pitfalls by prioritizing character consistency and ensuring that actions and decisions stem organically from characters' motivations and personalities. Developing a deep understanding of each character, including their desires, fears, and limits, can help ensure that their actions are believable and meaningful—thus maintaining the integrity of both character arcs and the overall plot."},{"instruction":"how impactful could it be for the story if not all problems are solved, and there are times where the protagonist gives up on certain problems, and never returns to them?","output":"Leaving some problems unsolved in a story and having a protagonist give up on certain issues without revisiting them can significantly impact the narrative and its reception in several profound ways. This approach can add layers of realism, provoke thought, and elicit strong emotional responses, ultimately enriching the story. Here's how these narrative choices can be impactful: # 1. **Realism and Relatability** Life often presents challenges that remain unresolved or require individuals to adjust their goals and expectations. By mirroring this reality, a story can resonate more deeply with its audience, increasing its relatability. Characters who face insurmountable obstacles, recognize their limits, and sometimes choose to abandon certain pursuits can reflect the complex nature of human decision-making and perseverance. This realism can help readers/viewers see parts of their struggles and realities within the story, fostering a deeper connection. # 2. **Character Depth and Growth** Choosing to let a protagonist give up on a problem can be a powerful tool for character development. It can demonstrate maturity, wisdom, or a prioritization of values, showing character growth in a non-traditional but realistic manner. The decision to move on from certain challenges can reveal the protagonist’s priorities, strengths, and vulnerabilities, offering a more nuanced portrait of who they are and who they become. # 3. **Theme Exploration** Not resolving all problems allows for the exploration of themes such as acceptance, loss, and the limitations of control. It can prompt readers to think deeply about the nature of problems, the idea of closure, and the human capacity for change and adaptation. Stories that explore the reality of unfinished business or unattained goals can leave a lasting impression by encouraging reflection on the inevitability of such outcomes in everyone's lives. # 4. **Avoidance of Conventional Narratives** By choosing not to tie up all loose ends or have the protagonist succeed at every turn, the narrative avoids the predictability and simplicity of many conventional stories. This can make the story stand out, offering an unexpected and thought-provoking journey. It challenges the audience's expectations for a neatly wrapped conclusion, providing a more memorable and discussion-worthy experience. # 5. **Emotional Impact** The emotional journey of dealing with unresolved issues or the conscious decision to give up can be profound. Readers might experience frustration, sadness, or empathy, but these emotions are a testament to the story's impact. Engaging with these feelings can make the narrative more impactful and enduring in the minds of the audience. # 6. **Reflects the Complexity of Life** By not solving all problems, the story acknowledges the complexity of life and the multifaceted nature of human existence. It reflects the truth that some issues are beyond resolution, some battles are lost, and some dreams remain unfulfilled. This acknowledgment can foster a sense of solidarity and understanding among readers, making them feel seen and heard. # Conclusion While traditional storytelling often emphasizes resolution and the overcoming of obstacles, choosing to leave some problems unsolved and allowing the protagonist to give up on certain challenges can offer a richer, more reflective, and emotionally resonant narrative. This approach underlines the importance of the journey over the destination and highlights the value of self-awareness, acceptance, and the courage to move forward in the face of unresolved challenges."},{"instruction":"what can be lame about a protagonist that just lets everyone else influence their thoughts and actions and opinions?","output":"A protagonist who consistently allows others to influence their thoughts, actions, and opinions, without showing significant personal growth or agency, can be problematic for several reasons. Such a character can negatively impact the story's engagement level, its thematic depth, and the audience's connection to the narrative. Here are specific aspects that can be considered \\"lame\\" or less appealing about this character type: # 1. **Lack of Agency** A protagonist with weak personal agency fails to drive the story forward through their decisions and actions. Instead of shaping the narrative, they become a passive recipient of others' influences. This can make the plot feel aimless or driven more by chance and external forces than by the protagonist's desires and struggles, potentially leading to a less compelling or satisfying story. # 2. **Reduced Relatability** While it's human to be influenced by others, a character who shows no backbone or independent thought can be difficult for audiences to relate to or root for. Readers and viewers often look for aspects of themselves in protagonists, including the ability to grow, learn, and eventually stand up for one's beliefs. A protagonist lacking these qualities might not evoke empathy or investment from the audience. # 3. **Predictable Character Arc** If a protagonist’s character arc consists solely of them being swayed by others without eventually learning to assert their independence, the arc can feel shallow and predictable. Part of what makes a character arc engaging is witnessing growth, struggles, and change. Without this, the protagonist’s journey can lack depth and fail to hold the audience's interest. # 4. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict and Growth** A protagonist who doesn't wrestle with inner conflicts or challenges and merely adopts the perspectives of those around them misses opportunities for rich, internal exploration and character development. Conflict, both internal and external, is a driving force in storytelling. It propels characters to grow, make difficult decisions, and overcome obstacles. Without this, the story can feel flat and the protagonist unevolved. # 5. **Undermines Themes** Powerful themes often emerge from a protagonist’s ability to navigate the push and pull of external influences while forging their path and standing by their convictions. A protagonist lacking this interaction may undermine or oversimplify thematic exploration, rendering the story's message less impactful or nuanced. # 6. **Diminished Emotional Impact** Protagonists who actively engage with their challenges, face conflicts, and are forced to make hard decisions generate emotional stakes. When a protagonist remains passive or overly influenced by others without pushing back, it can diminish the story's emotional impact. Audiences engage more deeply with stories where they fear for the protagonist, hope for their successes, and mourn their losses. # Tackling the Issue Addressing this issue often involves giving the protagonist moments of realization, confrontations that challenge their passivity, or introducing stakes high enough to require them to take a stand. By designing a narrative that gradually builds the protagonist's sense of self and agency, writers can transform a potentially \\"lame\\" character into a compelling and dynamic force within the story. Through this transformation, the story gains depth, engagement, and a more meaningful connection with its audience."},{"instruction":"how could action scenes, if any, be done in a mature way without coming off as a spectacle?","output":"Action scenes, while often associated with blockbuster spectacle and visual extravagance, can also be crafted in a mature, meaningful manner that emphasizes character development, thematic depth, and realism. Here’s how to approach action scenes to ensure they resonate on a deeper level without relying on spectacle: # 1. **Focus on Realism and Consequences** - **Physical and Emotional Realism:** Ground action scenes in the physical and emotional reality of the characters. This means acknowledging pain, fear, and exhaustion rather than portraying characters as invulnerable. Realistic portrayals make the action more relatable and impactful. - **Show Consequences:** Every action scene should have consequences for the characters involved, whether physical, emotional, or narrative. These consequences can add weight to the action, making it feel like a significant event that changes the characters or their situation. # 2. **Character-Driven Action** - **Motivations and Stakes:** Ensure that the action scenes are motivated by character desires and needs. Why are the characters involved in this action? What personal stakes do they have in the outcome? Answers to these questions can provide the action with a sense of purpose beyond mere spectacle. - **Character Choices and Growth:** Use action scenes as opportunities for character choices and growth. Characters might need to make difficult decisions under pressure, revealing their priorities, fears, and capabilities. This approach can deepen the audience's investment in the characters and the story. # 3. **Strategic Placement and Pacing** - **Build Tension:** Place action scenes strategically within the narrative to build tension and serve the story's pacing. Not every scene has to be high-octane; varying the intensity and type of action can make the moments that do happen more powerful. - **Pacing Within the Scene:** Within an action scene, pay attention to pacing. Use slower moments of tension-building and quicker, more intense bursts of action to create a dynamic rhythm that keeps viewers engaged without overwhelming them. # 4. **Purposeful Choreography** - **Serve the Story:** Choreograph action in a way that serves the story and character development. Every move or sequence should feel purposeful, advancing the plot, revealing character, or exploring themes, rather than merely showcasing abilities or techniques. - **Innovative and Unique Approaches:** Consider less conventional approaches to action. This could be through innovative use of the environment, focusing on the psychology of confrontation, or employing strategy and intelligence over brute force. # 5. **Thematic Integration** - **Reflect Themes:** Action scenes should reflect and explore the themes of the story. For example, if the story deals with themes of sacrifice, how do the action scenes test the characters' willingness to sacrifice for each other or their cause? - **Symbolic Action:** Consider how the action can be symbolic or metaphorical, representing larger conflicts, themes, or character dynamics beyond the immediate physical confrontation. # 6. **Sensory Description Over Spectacle** - **Immerse the Audience:** In written narratives, use sensory description to immerse the audience in the scene. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and tactile sensations of the action. This can create a vivid, engaging scene without resorting to spectacle. - **Emotional and Psychological Focus:** In both written and visual media, focusing on the emotional and psychological experience of the characters during action can create a more immersive and meaningful experience than spectacle alone. By emphasizing realism, character development, thematic depth, and strategic choreography, action scenes can be mature, meaningful, and integral to the narrative’s progression, rather than mere spectacles. This approach ensures that action scenes contribute significantly to the story, deepening the audience's engagement and emotional investment."},{"instruction":"I meant in a film or series.","output":"Crafting mature action scenes in films or series, without relying on spectacle, involves careful consideration of narrative purpose, character development, and thematic depth. Here's how filmmakers and screenwriters can achieve this: # 1. **Realism and Consequences** - **Physical Realism:** Avoid overly choreographed or unrealistic sequences that defy the laws of physics without good reason. Instead, opt for action that acknowledges the characters' human limitations and vulnerability. The portrayal of injuries, exhaustion, and the consequences of violence can add a layer of realism and gravity to the scene. - **Emotional Consequences:** Action scenes should have lasting impacts on the characters involved, affecting their emotional and psychological state. This enriches the story and makes the action feel more significant. # 2. **Character-Driven Action** - **Motivated by Character Needs and Desires:** Ensure that the action scenes are deeply rooted in the characters’ motivations. The best action scenes are those where the stakes are personal, and the outcome matters deeply to those involved. - **Character Development:** Use action scenes as a means to develop your characters. How they react under pressure, the decisions they make, and how they interact with others in these moments can reveal new facets of their character. # 3. **Strategic Placement and Pacing** - **Build Tension:** Treat action scenes as part of the overall narrative pacing, using them to build tension and release it in a way that serves the story's emotional arc. Not every moment has to be action-packed; the anticipation and aftermath are just as critical. - **Dynamics Within the Scene:** Balance the intensity within the scene itself, mixing faster-paced action with slower, more intense moments of decision-making or reflection to keep the audience engaged. # 4. **Purposeful Choreography** - **Supports the Narrative:** Choreograph action sequences in a way that advances the story or sheds light on character relationships and dynamics. Avoid gratuitous violence or action for action’s sake. - **Unique and Creative:** Seek innovative ways to stage action, using the environment, character skills, or the story’s unique elements to bring fresh perspectives to action scenes, making them memorable beyond their immediate impact. # 5. **Thematic Integration** - **Reflects Larger Themes:** Make sure action scenes are thematically integrated, reflecting the larger story's themes. This could mean staging a fight that’s not just about physical dominance but about ideological differences, or a chase that underlines a character’s deeper emotional escape. - **Symbolism and Metaphor:** Utilize action as a means to explore symbolic or metaphorical battles, enriching the narrative’s depth and providing audiences with rich material for interpretation. # 6. **Focus on Impact Over Spectacle** - **Emphasize Emotional and Psychological Experience:** Highlight what the characters are going through mentally and emotionally during the action. This creates a deeper connection between the audience and the characters, making the scene about more than just its visual impact. - **Cinematic Techniques:** Utilize cinematography, editing, and sound design to enhance the realism and emotional resonance of the action, rather than leaning on excessive special effects. Thoughtful use of these elements can increase the impact of action scenes without overwhelming the audience with spectacle. By prioritizing these aspects, filmmakers can create action scenes that are mature, meaningful, and integral to the story's development, resonating with audiences on a deeper level than spectacle alone. This approach ensures that action sequences contribute to the thematic richness and character exploration that define compelling narratives in film and series."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His political career is marked by a complex mix of nationalist, populist, and pragmatic stances, reflecting both his military background and his attempts to appeal to a broad spectrum of Indonesian voters. As of my last update in April 2023, here's an overview of Prabowo Subianto's notable political positions: 1. **Nationalism:** Prabowo is often described as a nationalist. He has frequently emphasized the importance of protecting Indonesia’s sovereignty and natural resources from foreign control or influence. He has also spoken against what he sees as unfair economic agreements and policies that disadvantage Indonesia in the global market. 2. **Economic Policy:** Prabowo's economic policies tend to lean towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on supporting domestic industries and reducing reliance on foreign investment and imports. He has advocated for policies that boost the agricultural sector, aiming to make Indonesia self-sufficient in food production. He has also spoken in favor of increasing state control over strategic sectors of the economy. 3. **Defense and Security:** Given his background as a former military general, Prabowo has called for strengthening Indonesia's military capabilities and defense infrastructure. He has advocated for increasing the defense budget to modernize the armed forces and improve Indonesia’s maritime security to protect its vast archipelago. 4. **Islamic Identity:** Though Indonesia is a secular country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Prabowo has at times aligned himself with Islamic political parties and groups in an attempt to broaden his appeal. His stance on religious issues appears to be moderate, promoting religious tolerance, but his political alliances have led to varied interpretations of his position on the role of Islam in government. 5. **Populism:** Prabowo has used populist rhetoric, often emphasizing that his leadership would champion the cause of the \\"little people\\" or ordinary citizens of Indonesia against what he portrays as an uncaring elite. He has campaigned on increasing welfare and improving the quality of life for the poor. 6. **Political Reform:** He has occasionally spoken about the need for political reform in Indonesia, critiquing the country’s democracy for being weak and for allowing corruption to persist. However, his proposals for reform have been viewed with skepticism by some observers, who point to his military past and his involvement in human rights controversies. 7. **Human Rights:** Prabowo's record has been controversial due to allegations of human rights abuses during his tenure in the military, particularly in East Timor and against political dissidents. He has denied wrongdoing, but these issues have been a recurring theme in political opposition to his candidacies. 8. **International Relations:** Prabowo has advocated for a balanced foreign policy, emphasizing Indonesia's strategic autonomy. He has called for stronger relations with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia as well as major powers like China, the United States, and Russia, aiming to leverage these relationships for Indonesia’s benefit. Over time, the specifics of Prabowo's positions have evolved as he has adapted to changing political landscapes and sought to broaden his appeal to different segments of Indonesia's diverse electorate. As of my last update, he serves as the Minister of Defense in President Joko Widodo's administration, a position that might influence his stances on certain issues, especially regarding national defense and security."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Throughout his career, Baswedan has articulated and adopted various political positions, often catering to the diverse and dynamic political climate of Indonesia. Here are several key areas reflecting his political positions: # 1. Education Reform Having an academic background, including serving as the Rector of Paramadina University in Jakarta, Baswedan has emphasized the importance of education reform. He proposed and implemented the \\"Jakarta Smart Card\\" (KJP) program, aimed at providing financial assistance for school children, covering not just tuition fees but also the cost of books and school uniforms. This initiative reflects his commitment to enhancing access to education and reducing the economic burden on families. # 2. Infrastructure and Public Transport Baswedan has shown a keen interest in improving Jakarta's infrastructure and public transport systems. His administration continued the development of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) projects initiated by his predecessors. These efforts were aimed at alleviating the chronic traffic congestion in the nation’s capital and promoting more sustainable modes of transportation. # 3. Populism Anies Baswedan's rise to the governorship was marked by a campaign that many observers noted had populist undertones. He managed to garner support from a wide array of Jakarta’s population, partly by leveraging social programs like the KJP and promising enhancements in public services. His tenure also reflected a layered approach to governance, attempting to balance economic development with social welfare. # 4. Religious and Ethnic Sentiments In a country as diverse as Indonesia, religious and ethnic sentiments often play a significant role in politics. Baswedan's gubernatorial campaign and subsequent policies were sometimes criticized for appealing to identity politics, particularly in appealing to the Muslim majority. However, he has also called for unity and sought to address various social issues impacting all communities in Jakarta. # 5. Urban Poor and Social Justice Addressing the plight of the urban poor has been a part of Baswedan's policy focus. His administration undertook efforts to improve the living conditions in informal settlements and sought to confront issues related to social justice, such as ensuring more equitable access to city resources and services. # Future Political Aspirations As of 2023, there has been much speculation about Baswedan's future in Indonesian politics, with expectations that he might pursue higher office, potentially running for the presidency. His political positions and actions as Governor of Jakarta are likely to influence and be scrutinized in the context of any future political ambitions. It's important to note that political positions can evolve, and the interpretation of those positions can differ based on perspectives. Baswedan's stance on various issues may continue to develop as he engages with different facets of Indonesia's political discourse."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

\`cv2.inRange\`は色の範囲を検出するのに非常に効率的ですが、毎回同じ範囲（\`lower_bound\`, \`upper_bound\`）を使用しているため、これらの値をクラス変数として一度計算して再利用するとよいでしょう。 4. **グローバル変数の使用を避ける**： - \`GRABZONE\`, \`COLOR\`, \`TOLERANCE\`などの変数はグローバルに定義されていますが、これらをクラス変数に変更することでカプセル化を向上させ、コードの読みやすさを向上させるとともに、将来的な変更を容易にします。 以下は、上記の提案を一部適用した改善例です。全ての部分に対する修正ではないため、アイデアとして参考にしてください。 \`\`\`python import mss import numpy as np import keyboard import time import cv2 import winsound import threading import timeit class MellyBOT: def __init__(self, config): self.toggled = False self.mode = 0 self.last_reac = 0 self.scan_count_interval = 10000 self.current_scan_count = 0 self.sct = mss.mss() self.monitor = self.sct.monitors[0] # コンフィグの値を使用 self.trigger_key = config[\\"trigger_key\\"] self.color_name = config[\\"color\\"] self.color = self.color_to_rgb(self.color_name) self.tolerance = 32 self.grabzone = 10 self.lower_bound, self.upper_bound = self.calculate_bounds(self.color, self.tolerance) self.bot_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.bot_loop, daemon=True) self.bot_thread.start() def color_to_rgb(self, color_name): colors = { \\"purple\\": np.array([250, 100, 250]), \\"red\\": np.array([255, 0, 0]), \\"yellow\\": np.array([252, 252, 84]) } return colors[color_name] def calculate_bounds(self, color, tolerance): return color -

A su lado, en el asiento trasero del auto patrulla, yacía Jonathan, con una camisa de fuerza ajustada, mirándola con ojos que destilaban una mezcla de ira y desprecio. Pero el detalle más humillante para él era, sin duda, el hecho de estar en pañales, un requisito no negociable dado lo extenso del trayecto. Sofía, con una sonrisa irónica que rara vez se desvanecía de su rostro, no dejaba de lanzar comentarios mordaces cada vez que miraba por el retrovisor, disfrutando de la visible incomodidad de su cautivo. \\"¿Cómo va el paseo, Jonathan? ¿Necesitás que te cante una de cuna para que no sea tan duro el viaje?\\", decía ella, sin perder la oportunidad de remarcar la penosa situación en la que él se encontraba. Jonathan, por su parte, hervía en su asiento, incapaz de liberarse o de escapar de la mortificante situación. Los gruñidos y los insultos murmurados eran lo único que permitía su dignidad en tal estado. Tras varias horas de viaje, la tensión dentro del auto alcanzó un límite insostenible. Sofía, cansada de escuchar los constantes murmullos y desplantes de Jonathan, decidió que era momento de tomar cartas en el asunto. Se detuvo en un área de descanso, al borde de la carretera, y tras asegurarse de que nadie más estaba por los alrededores, abrió la guantera y sacó un rollo de cinta de embalar. \\"Mirá, Jonathan, la cosa es simple. Vas a estar amordazado lo que resta del viaje. Pero, como somos gente civilizada, necesito tu consentimiento antes de proceder\\", le explicó con una seriedad que contrastaba con su habitual tono burlón. Jonathan, furioso, pero consciente de que no tenía otra opción, asintió con una mirada fulminante. Sofía, meticulosa, sacó su celular y grabó un video donde Jonathan, a regañadientes, daba su consentimiento para ser amordazado. Una vez que la cinta cubrió su boca, Sofía no pudo resistirse a añadir: “Ahora sí, mi querido, vas a aprender lo que es bueno. Y no te hagas el malo, porque sino terminás así en la comisaría, pero sin la camisa de fuerza”, le advirtió con un acento argentino tan marcado que parecía música para sus oídos. El resto del viaje fue notablemente más tranquilo, con la radio como única compañía y la lluvia que finalmente comenzó a caer, marcando el ritmo de un trayecto que se tornó casi melancólico. Jonathan, derrotado y humillado, se sumió en un silencio forzado, mientras Sofía se permitía una sonrisa de satisfacción, sabiendo que había ganado esta batalla. Este era solo el comienzo de un largo y retorcido camino que ambos tenían por delante, marcado por la ironía, la mordacidad y, por supuesto, una inquebrantable determinación por parte de Sofía de mantener el control, sin importar el costo. Y así, entre la tensión y los juegos de poder, el vehículo continuó su travesía bajo la tormenta, alejándose cada vez más de cualquier señal de civilización, adentrándose en lo desconocido."},{"instruction":"La misma escena pero que sofia hable más","output":"Título: *En Ruta con el Desafío* Capítulo 1: *Diálogo en el Camino* Los nubarrones amenazaban con desatar su furia en cualquier momento, un escenario casi poético si no fuera por el tenso ambiente dentro del auto donde la oficial Sofía Celasco transportaba a Jonathan, atrapado en una camisa de fuerza y, para mayor humillación, en pañales, debido a lo prolongado de su viaje. Sofía, con una sonrisa que apenas disimulaba su regocijo por la situación, no dejaba pasar oportunidad para inyectar su peculiar sentido del humor en la situación. \\"Qué jornada nos espera, ¿no te parece, Jonathan? Espero que encuentres cómodo el 'equipamiento' especial que te hemos provisto. No todos los días se recibe un trato VIP como este\\", comentó con una ironía que cortaba más fino que el viento frío del exterior. Jonathan, cuyo rostro era un poema de la furia contenida y la humillación, se limitaba a gruñir y maldecir su suerte, sus palabras amortiguadas por la situación. Después de varias horas así, Sofía pareció hallar el monólogo interior que venía manteniendo insuficiente. Mirando a Jonathan a través del retrovisor, decidió elevar la apuesta en su juego unilateral de provocaciones. Deteniendo el auto en un apartado área de descanso, buscó algo en la guantera mientras hablaba, sin dejar de mirar a Jonathan, quien la miraba desconcertado y aún enfurecido. \\"Ves, Jonathan, hay algo mágico en los viajes largos. Es esa sensación de libertad, el horizonte siempre cambiante. Pero, claro, para disfrutar realmente de esa sensación, uno debe estar, digamos, menos... vocal\\", dijo Sofía, extrayendo un rollo de cinta de embalar con un dramatismo casi teatral. \\"Y pensándolo bien, creo que es justo lo que necesitamos. Un poco de silencio. Pero ojo, eh, no soy una bárbara. Voy a hacer las cosas como manda la ley. Necesito tu consentimiento para amordazarte. Vamos a grabarlo para que quede bien claro.\\" El consentimiento forzado de Jonathan fue obtenido y registrado con una eficacia que hablaba volúmenes de la experiencia de Sofía en lidiar con situaciones tensas. \\"Perfecto, ahora que hemos establecido ese pequeño detalle, podemos continuar nuestro viaje con un poco más... de paz y tranquilidad.\\" Una vez reiniciado el viaje, mientras la lluvia finalmente comenzaba a caer, Sofía se permitió soltar las palabras que hasta el momento había mantenido para sí. \\"Sabes, Jonathan, siempre creí que el silencio era subestimado. A veces, en el ruido constante de nuestras vidas, olvidamos lo esencial. Como ahora, este momento, tú y yo, en este pequeño viaje hacia lo desconocido. Ajeno a estos pequeños, pero significativos, inconvenientes, hay algo casi poético, ¿no te parece? Aunque, claro, puedo entender que no veas la belleza de este momento, dada tu... particular situación.\\" El vehículo atravesó la tormenta, un pequeño punto de luz avanzando por la carretera vacía, con Sofía continuando su monólogo, alternando entre reflexiones personales y comentarios acerca del paisaje que atravesaban, disfrutando del sonido de su propia voz que, en cierto modo, llenaba el espacio dejado por el silencio forzado de Jonathan. Era claro que, para Sofía, este viaje era más que una simple tarea; era una oportunidad para un diálogo, aunque fuera unidireccional, con alguien que no tenía más opción que escuchar. Y en el aislamiento de ese camino lluvioso, ella encontró la manera perfecta de combinar el cumplimiento del deber con el disfrute de la compañía, aunque fuera en las más inusuales circunstancias."},{"instruction":"What do you know about accessibility champions?","output":"Accessibility Champions refer to individuals or groups committed to advocating for, implementing, and promoting accessibility standards and practices within organizations, communities, or digital platforms.

The name is Wrath and she does absolutely amazing on music. But she lacks Wifi so bad","output":"For your OC named Wrath, who excels in music but struggles with poor Wi-Fi connectivity, you can craft a pose that encapsulates both her musical prowess and her frustration with technology. Given the mix of themes, consider the following pose idea that balances her talent and her irritation: **Pose Description:** Wrath is depicted in a dynamic, mid-motion pose that showcases her dual nature. Her left hand is elegantly extended outward, fingers poised as if she's masterfully conducting an unseen orchestra or manipulating musical notes in the air - a nod to her amazing musical skills. This part of her pose represents her control, passion, and finesse in music, suggesting she can create beautiful melodies or command the sound waves around her. In stark contrast, her right hand clenches a modem or a router, with cables entwined between her fingers, symbolizing her struggle with poor Wi-Fi. Her grip on the device is tight, knuckles whitened, capturing her frustration. Create an expression on her face that mirrors this duality: one eye calm and focused, as if lost in her musical creation, while the other eye glares or squints towards the modem/router, eyebrows knitted in clear vexation. **Facial Expression:** Her face is a canvas of contrasting emotions. One side is serene and composed, reflecting her confidence and joy in her musical abilities. This side could be illuminated slightly more than the other, as if a soft spotlight is highlighting her artistic side. The other half of her face, the one facing the modem/router, is shadowed, featuring a frown, gritted teeth, or an annoyed scowl directed at the troublesome piece of technology. **Background Elements:** To further emphasize these aspects of her character, the background could include musical notes and symbols floating around her, perhaps even forming a subtle, visual melody line that flows fluidly from her conducting hand. On the frustrated side, incorporate glitchy, digital artifacts or static interference emanating from the modem/router, visually representing the poor Wi-Fi connection. **Overall Vibe:** The overall vibe of the pose is one of dynamic tension, capturing Wrath’s mastery and love of music while simultaneously depicting her battle against the modern-day annoyance of unreliable technology. This pose not only highlights her talents and challenges but also adds depth to her character, making her feel more relatable and multifaceted. This concept should provide a compelling visual representation of Wrath, showcasing not just her abilities and interests, but also the very real struggle she faces, thus making her a more interesting and engaging character."},{"instruction":"Ok let's take it back. A pose suggestion with only a Simple of a wifi sign with a Crossed out circle in it. And it's floating and glowing red alittle","output":"For a more simplified and focused pose capturing Wrath's musical talent juxtaposed with her frustration over poor Wi-Fi, you might consider this artistic direction: **Pose Description:** Wrath stands confidently with one hand raised above her head, palm facing outward as if she's effortlessly suspending a glowing, red, \\"No Wi-Fi\\" symbol (a Wi-Fi icon with a crossed-out circle over it) in the air above her. This symbol hovers just above her palm, glowing ominously in a deep shade of red to signify both her power and her irritation with her constant connectivity issues. Her stance is one of control and defiance, as if she's literally rising above the challenges posed by her lack of reliable internet connection. Her other hand is casually resting on her hip or holding an instrument relevant to her musical prowess—perhaps a guitar's neck or a microphone stand, subtly underlining her identity as a musician. The instrument serves as a silent testament to her skill and passion for music, balancing out the technological frustration symbolized by the floating No Wi-Fi icon. **Facial Expression:** Wrath's expression is one of smug defiance and a hint of annoyance, conveying her disdain for the internet problems she faces. Her brows are slightly furrowed, and she might be smirking or wearing a half-smile, as if mocking the very notion that something as trivial as poor Wi-Fi could hinder her talent and determination. Her eyes could be focused on the No Wi-Fi symbol, giving off a vibe that she's confronting the issue head-on, yet not letting it dominate her spirit or her music. **Body Positioning:** Her body language further communicates her resilience and audacity. With her back straight, shoulders relaxed but poised, and one foot slightly in front of the other, she exudes confidence and a rock-star aura. She's grounded and unshakeable, metaphorically standing firm against the obstacles she faces. **Environment and Lighting:** The environment around her can be minimal, putting the full spotlight on Wrath and the No Wi-Fi symbol. The lighting plays a crucial role here, with a spotlight effect emphasizing Wrath and casting a vibrant glow from the No Wi-Fi icon. The red light not only highlights the symbol but also casts subtle red hues onto Wrath, visually tying her frustration with poor connectivity to her character, yet in a way that shows she remains powerful and undeterred. **Overall Impact:** This pose suggests that, despite the annoyance of poor Wi-Fi connectivity, Wrath remains a dominant, talented musician who refuses to let technology woes dampen her spirit or her music. The simplicity of the concept—a single, powerful image of defiance against a backdrop of modern-day frustration—strikes a chord with the universal struggle against technological limitations, making Wrath a relatable and inspiring character."},{"instruction":"What would wrath full Dec name be example. Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant","output":"Wrath's full descriptive name, capturing her essence as a musically inclined character with a fiery disposition and a constant battle against poor Wi-Fi connectivity, could be: **Wrath Rhythmica: Fury’s Melody, Silenced Signal's Siren** This name encapsulates various facets of her character: - **Wrath Rhythmica**: Indicates her primary characteristic of passionate fury, combined with her deep connection to music (\\"Rhythmica\\" suggesting rhythm and melody). - **Fury's Melody**: Suggests that her wrath and anger find an outlet and expression through her music, turning her fury into something beautiful and compelling. - **Silenced Signal's Siren**: Evokes the idea of her being like a siren, enchanting and powerful, whose melodic call is persistently hindered by the \\"silenced signal\\" of poor Wi-Fi, yet she continues to sing out, defiantly."},{"instruction":"She don't sing. She rather composes on a computer","output":"Given the detail that Wrath's talent lies in composing music on a computer rather than singing, let's refine her descriptive name to better reflect her unique blend of electronic composition mastery and technological struggles: **Wrath Synthetica: Harmony's Hacker, The Dissonance of Disconnected Signals** This revised name emphasizes: - **Wrath Synthetica**: Suggests her skill in creating synthetic (electronic) music and her intense passion or wrath when facing obstacles. The name conveys both her artistic side and her combative nature against technological woes. - **Harmony's Hacker**: Reflects her adeptness and cleverness in crafting harmonies and beats using electronic means. It portrays her as someone who 'hacks' together harmonies, perhaps even suggesting a knack for overcoming technical limitations creatively. - **The Dissonance of Disconnected Signals**: Captures her struggle with unreliable Wi-Fi as a dissonant note in her otherwise harmonious electronic music career. It’s a metaphor for the frustration and interruptions in connectivity that clash with her creative flow, yet she perseveres despite these challenges."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His appearance changes daily, varying by age, gender, and nationality, which makes his life extremely complicated, especially when it comes to forming and maintaining personal relationships. Woo-jin's confession to Yi-soo, the female lead, is a significant moment in the film because it highlights his vulnerability and the depth of his feelings for her. The fact that Woo-jin's face and body change daily might have contributed to his courage to confess in two main ways: 1. **Anonymity and Fear of Rejection**: His constantly changing appearance could have given him a form of anonymity that might make the fear of rejection less personal. On one hand, if she rejected him, it would not be \\"him\\" in his permanent form being rejected, but rather one of his many temporary appearances. This could provide a psychological cushion against the fear of rejection. 2. **Authenticity of Love**: On the other hand, Woo-jin's unique condition could also have made the confession particularly meaningful and courageous because he is revealing not just his feelings but also the truth about his incredible condition. Confessing to Yi-soo requires him to expose the vulnerability and complexity of his situation. It's a test of true love because he needs to be loved for who he is on the inside, regardless of his external appearance. Revealing his secret and his feelings exposes him to a profound risk of being misunderstood or rejected not just for his appearance on that day, but for the whole of his unpredictable and challenging condition. Woo-jin's confession is thus a pivotal and courageous moment that underscores one of the film's central themes: the importance of seeing and loving people for who they are on the inside rather than for their external appearance. The movie beautifully explores questions of identity, love, and acceptance, and Woo-jin's confession is a crucial element of that exploration."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

它被其他雜物壓迫著，擠在一個角落，身上的紙張也都起了角，皺了皮。我將它從黑暗深淵中救出，讓它重見天日。用手把折起的地方撫平，才赫然發現簿面上寫著我小學的校名。淺粉的封面早已起了許多不知何來的斑點，皺皺的，跟年邁女人的皮膚一樣糟糕。只見封面一欄的資料除了我的名字，一無所有。 「這不是至少應該填寫上什麼科目的本子嗎？」我低頭嘀咕著。隨手翻開一頁，是一些單一的字體，又過幾頁，是兩句再普通不過的句子，二者之間完全沒有任何一絲的聯繫。看了看上面記錄的日期一—二零一六年，那正是我剛來香港定居，讀小四前的一個暑假。 「來來來，這是你們的練習簿，三姐妹一人一本，待會默書。」母親一手拿著報紙，一手指著桌上的三本簿子。 「默書？」三人不約而同地從口中噴出同一句話。「默什麼 書？」 「初來香港，你們繁體字都不會寫多個，若是我不嘮叨你們，你們也是捧著手機虛度整個下午罷了，倒不如給些活你們幹。 此時兩點半，待會三點來默。」 到了三點，三姐妹圍著木桌坐在一起，你望我，我望你，誰也不敢吭聲，只有大眼瞪小眼的份。母親拿著報紙，讀著上面文章的句子。我們聽著，卻愣是寫不出一個繁體字來。為了掩飾自己不會寫的尷尬，托著頭的，抓耳撓腮的，什麼招數都試過了。但母親還是用她的「火眼金睛」，發現我們「做賊心虛」，她伸頭望過來時，我們還試圖用手去遮蓋住空自的紙頁。 然而下場自然是被罵得狗血淋頭，我們的頭低得跟小雞啄米一樣。母親罵了好一會兒，情緒平靜下來，緩緩地說道，「每個錯字抄寫五遍，若是錯了四個字以上，就要整句抄寫。明天重新默寫。」她神情嚴肅，我們哪還敢有半點怨言，惟有默默答應。 翌日，依舊還是同樣時間，「酷刑」再次來臨。幸好我有看過幾眼上次的「題目出處」，所以這次來到「試場」時也並非毫無準備。但見另外兩位「考生」都胸有成竹的模樣，也還是令我暗暗吃驚。默寫開始，我豎起耳朵專心聽著母親讀題目，卻只聽著一些陌生的句子進入我的耳朵，這哪是我複習的內容！頓時覺得自己頭皮發麻，不過若是此刻我才說我所複習的不是這些，相信她們也只會覺得我在為自己玩手機而開辯罷了。惟有硬著頭皮上了。最終我當然還是錯漏百出，「還」字少了一橫，「頭」字又寫得完全不像一個字，「樣」字更是寫回簡體字，試圖蒙混過關。 我戰戰兢兢地把簿子交出去，母親拿著紅筆，像是「判官」一樣，審視著我的字跡。她的右手一起一落，一圈一點。很快，她的目光就從簿子上移到去我的身上。當然，最後又是一頓責罵。 不知是母親罵得凶，還是我自覺委屈，眼前的景象像是結了霜一樣，開始變得模糊不清。我咬著嘴唇，仰頭望著白裡帶黃的天花板，希望自己可以控制住眼淚，不掉下來。可當我一低下頭，簿面上就開始出現大小相似的圓點，濕了，變深色。我那不爭氣的眼淚還是流了出來。 我用力地握住綠筆，淚流滿面地一筆一寫著錯字的改正，那力度仿佛是在控訴自己的不忿。正當我還在怨天尤人，為自己沒留意改了默書範圍而找借口時，兩位姐姐走過來坐在我旁邊。 我以為她們是來幸災樂禍、恥笑我的，於是我捂住耳朵，佯裝聽不到她們說話。但她們輕輕地將我的手放下，而且語重心長地說道，「這次默書沒有複習，那就下次繼續努力便是。」 「如果有什麼疑間，不妨向我們提出，我們好歹也是你的姐姐，再不然，問母親也行！」 突然其來的關心讓我頓感束手無措，說謝謝似乎過於疏遠，擁抱又好像太過肉麻。我唯有破涕而笑，才能回應她們那赤裸裸的一片關心一一微笑但真誠。 至此之後，每次複習的時候，我們三姐妹便互相發問，默書時便鬥誰錯的最少，改正時又坐在一起，有說有笑，一起抄寫錯字，日復一日，簿子承載的字句越來越繁複，每一頁出現的綠筆改正越來越少，取而代之的是鮮紅的勾越來越多。 隨著我小學的年級越來越高，母親喊著我們默書的日子也逐漸減少，簿子裡每頁上面的日期也由相連著變到斷斷續續。後來步入中學，這本沒有標題的練習簿亦隨之丟進抽屜，最後更是被雜物淹沒。 我摸著淚水乾透而留痕的簿面，回想當時默書時的各種情形，不禁笑了出來。但無論如何，即使它被埋沒多年，也不可否認它陪著我經歷了無數個默書，那畢竟是一個短暫、因新來港而迷茫、但充滿美好回憶的歲月。 最不能遺忘的是，它象徵著我與姐妹共同進退的時光，更是我努力的痕跡。 這一篇的主題","output":"這一篇的主題是關於家庭、學習挑戰、團結和成長。故事透過主角清理雜物時發現的一本舊練習簿，帶出了一段人生階段中的重要回憶。當主角和她的姐妹初來香港，面對著學習繁體字的挑戰時，她們在母親的嚴格督促下，通過一系列「默書」練習，一起克服困難、相互支持和鼓勵，最終收獲了學習上的進步以及彼此間更深的情感聯繫。 這個故事展現了成長過程中家庭成員的相互支持是如何幫助克服挑戰的，以及勤勉學習的重要性。它也提醒了我們，雖然這些歷程可能伴隨著壓力、挫敗感和眼淚，但學習的過程和家庭的陪伴也能帶來難以忘懷的回憶和寶貴的成長經驗。最後，這個故事強調了時間的流逝和回憶的珍貴，鼓勵我們珍惜那些塑造我們的過去經歷，以及那些一起經歷風雨的人。"},{"instruction":"可以加插什麼片段，加強抒情寫人的效果","output":"為了加強抒情寫人的效果，可以考慮在故事中加插一段主角在現代生活中，因一個小事物或情境突然回憶起過去的經歷，從而引起對過去美好時光的深刻思念和感悟的片段。這種片段能夠幫助讀者產生共鳴，加深對人物情感的理解和同情，以下是一個具體的例子： --- 在一個悠閒的週末下午，主角正在咖啡店里與朋友閒聊。陽光透過窗戶灑在桌上，溫暖而柔和。正當她抬手拿起咖啡杯時，一滴水珠沿著杯壁滑落，悄無聲息地落在桌面上，留下一個小小的水印。這個微不足道的瞬間，卻突然激起了她對過去的懷念。 她的思緒瞬間飛回那個充滿笑聲和淚水的學習時光，當時她和姐妹們正圍坐在家裏的木桌旁，努力學習繁體字。她記起了母親溫柔而堅定的指導，姐妹間相互鼓勵的話語，還有那些由於努力而取得的小小進步。她回憶起，某一次在默書時，因為過於緊張而不小心打翻了水杯，水漬不僅弄濕了桌子，也沾溼了她的練習簿。當時的她多麼惶恐，怕被母親責罵，但是母親只是輕輕地拍了拍她的頭，柔聲說，「沒關係，認真做就是最好的。」 從那以後，每當主角看到水珠或水漬，不管是在哪裡，總會想起自己的家人和那段學習的日子，心中充滿了溫馨和感激。這些小事物和情境，像是一把鑰匙，開啟了她記憶中珍貴時光的寶庫。 --- 透過這樣的描寫，不僅加深了故事的情感層次，也讓主角的性格和過去的經歷更加立體，使得讀者能夠更好地理解人物內心的感受，從而產生更強烈的共鳴。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator

A fight scene in a film or series doesn't have to be a mere spectacle; it can significantly contribute to the narrative, character development, or the underlying themes. When the focus shifts from the choreography and spectacle to the characters' motivations, objectives, and development, these scenes become much more engaging and meaningful. Here's how you could handle gunfights or sword fights with this approach: # Establish Clear Stakes and Objectives Make sure it’s clear what the characters are trying to achieve and what's at stake. If the characters are fighting, it should be for a reason deeply integrated into the plot or their development. Each action they take should move them closer or present an obstacle to achieving their goal. # Motivation Beyond the Fight The characters should have motivations that extend beyond just winning the fight. Maybe they're trying to protect someone, retrieve an important object, or escape to fight another day. This approach adds layers to the scene, making the audience more invested in the outcome. # Use the Environment Incorporate the setting into the fight in a way that emphasizes the characters' objectives. For example, in a gunfight, maybe the protagonist is trying to reach a specific location rather than merely take out the opponents. The way they navigate the environment and use it to their advantage can reveal a lot about their priorities and skills. # Make the Characters Reluctant Fighters Show that the characters are not fighting because they want to but because they have to. This can be done by having them try to avoid the conflict initially or look for non-violent solutions. Their eventual engagement in combat underlines the importance of their goals and can add a layer of tragedy or gravity to the fight. # Character Interaction and Dialogue Even in the midst of action, incorporate meaningful dialogue or interaction that reveals character relationships, tension, or backstory. For instance, during a sword fight, the dialogue could hint at a past rivalry, mutual respect, or a deep-seated grudge. This makes the fight about more than just physical prowess. # Show Consequences Highlight the consequences of the fight, both physically and emotionally. This could be through showing injuries, the toll the fight takes on the environment, or the emotional impact on the characters and bystanders. This emphasizes that the fight is significant and not just an action-packed interlude. # Conclusion Reflects on Characters The outcome of the fight should reflect back on the characters' objectives and development. Whether they win, lose, or retreat, what happens during and after the fight should influence their journey or change their perspective in some way. # Example: In a sword fight scene, rather than a prolonged duel, the protagonist might be trying to get past the antagonist to reach something vital—a cure for a poisoned friend, perhaps. Their moves are more about evasion and pushing forward rather than defeating the opponent. As they fight, they plead with the antagonist, revealing a shared history and the protagonist's desperation. This approach keeps the focus on the goal and the characters, not just the spectacle of the fight. By employing these techniques, fight scenes in films and series can be more than just visual excitement; they can be pivotal moments that deepen the narrative and the audience's connection to the characters."},{"instruction":"perhaps introducing lots of other ways to fight other than violence could help too?","output":"Absolutely, diversifying the means of conflict resolution in a story can add depth and originality, moving beyond traditional physical confrontations to portray a more nuanced understanding of \\"fighting.\\" Consider these alternative approaches: # Intellectual Battles Characters can engage in debates, puzzles, or games of strategy that serve as proxies for physical fights. This can be particularly effective in stories focusing on politics, law, or intellectual pursuits. For example, courtroom dramas often replace physical fights with legal battles, where the outcome is just as critical and tension-filled. # Emotional and Psychological Conflict Internal struggles, where characters battle their own fears, doubts, or desires, can be compelling. Similarly, interpersonal conflicts that involve manipulation, persuasion, or emotional appeals add layers to the narrative. This can be seen in dramas where the protagonist must overcome personal demons or convince a loved one to make a difficult choice. # Stealth and Evasion Sometimes, the \\"fight\\" can be about avoiding direct confrontation altogether. Scenes focusing on stealth, evasion, or escape highlight cunning and resourcefulness. This approach can be thrilling and suspenseful, emphasizing the character's intelligence and adaptability. # Diplomacy and Negotiation Portraying characters resolving conflicts through dialogue, negotiation, or compromise showcases a different set of skills. This approach can highlight the complexity of human relationships and the difficulty of achieving mutual understanding. It's particularly effective in stories where peace or cooperation is a central theme. # Non-violent Resistance Characters might engage in acts of civil disobedience, protests, or other forms of non-violent resistance. These scenes can be powerful, showcasing courage and conviction without resorting to violence. They often play a significant role in stories about social justice or political activism. # Technology and Hacking In more modern or futuristic settings, conflicts might revolve around technology. Characters could engage in hacking battles, where they attempt to outsmart each other digitally. This can create tension and excitement without physical violence, focusing on intellectual prowess. # Magic and Powers In fantasy settings, conflicts might be resolved through the use of magic or supernatural abilities. While this can still involve combat, it also opens the door to more creative resolutions—using powers to protect, heal, or incapacitate rather than to harm. # Sports and Competitions Sports, races, or other competitive events can serve as the battleground for characters' conflicts. This approach allows for a display of skill, determination, and sportsmanship, focusing on personal achievement and growth as much as the outcome of the event. By incorporating these alternative methods of \\"fighting,\\" stories can explore a broader range of human experiences and values. These approaches can add complexity to the narrative, offering fresh perspectives on conflict and its resolution beyond physical violence."},{"instruction":"how can action scenes be included in a way that makes viewers uncomfortable, and don't want the characters to fight?","output":"Creating action scenes that make viewers uncomfortable and disinclined towards violence requires a strategic approach that highlights the ugliness and cost of violence rather than its spectacle. Here's how filmmakers or storytellers might achieve this: # Focus on Realism and Consequences 1. **Graphic Realism**: Go beyond the sanitized versions of violence often portrayed in mainstream media. Show the realistic consequences of violence—blood, injuries, and the emotional toll it takes on individuals involved. This makes the violence harder to digest and less 'entertaining.' 2. **Long-term Repercussions**: Show the long-term physical and psychological effects of violence on characters. This can include PTSD, chronic pain, or disability, emphasizing that the consequences of violence extend beyond the immediate action. # Humanize All Characters 3. **Humanize the \\"Enemies\\"**: Ensure that even the antagonists are shown as fully fleshed out characters with their own motivations, fears, and families. This makes the conflict more nuanced and the cost of violence more personal. 4. **Collateral Damage**: Highlight the impact of violence on innocent bystanders. Show how violence disrupts lives or devastates families, fostering empathy and making viewers wish for a resolution that avoids conflict. # Use Unsettling Cinematography and Sound Design 5. **Uncomfortable Cinematography**: Utilize close-ups to capture the pain and fear on characters' faces, claustrophobic framing to evoke a sense of entrapment, or hand-held camera work to convey chaos and disorientation. 6. **Distressing Sound Design**: Instead of heroic music, use dissonant soundtracks, silence, or the realistic sounds of the environment and violence itself (e.g., cries of pain, the sound of struggling) to unsettle the viewer. # Ethical and Moral Dilemmas 7. **Moral Ambiguity**: Place characters in situations where the 'right' action is unclear, and the moral cost of violence is high. This can make the audience question the justifications for violence and its implications. 8. **Confront the Audience's Expectations**: Subvert typical action tropes by denying the audience the catharsis normally provided by action scenes. Instead of a clear victory, scenes could end unresolved, or with a pyrrhic victory that feels more like a loss. # Emphasize the Emotional Toll 9. **Show Fear and Reluctance**: Characters should not rush into violence. Showing their fear, hesitation, and the emotional burden of having to fight makes the action seem less desirable. 10. **Grieve the Loss**: Allow space within the narrative for characters (and thereby the audience) to grieve the losses incurred from violence. This reinforces the idea that violence has significant and regrettable costs. By adopting these strategies, filmmakers and writers can craft action scenes that are powerful, thought-provoking, and uncomfortable, steering viewers away from glorifying violence and instead prompting them to seek non-violent resolutions within the story and perhaps, by extension, in the real world."},{"instruction":"in contrast, how could the dialogue scenes, character interactions be more entertaining to watch?","output":"Creating entertaining dialogue scenes and character interactions involves more than just witty exchanges; it requires depth, conflict, and development that captivate the audience and make the characters truly engaging. Here are ways to achieve this: # 1. Layered Dialogue Craft dialogue that operates on multiple levels. Include subtext where characters say one thing but mean another, playing with irony, hidden motives, or internal conflicts. This layers conversations with meaning, making viewers pay closer attention and engage more deeply with character dynamics. # 2. Conflict and Tension Introduce conflict in conversations, not just through disagreement but through differing desires, secrets, or values. This conflict doesn't have to be aggressive; it can be playful, creating a dynamic interaction that's entertaining to watch. # 3. Character Specificity Give each character a distinct voice and perspective. This means their vocabulary, rhythm of speech, humor, and references should reflect their background, personality, and current emotional state. When characters with unique voices interact, the dialogue naturally becomes more engaging. # 4. Humor and Wit Incorporate humor and wit into conversations, but ensure it's character-driven. A well-timed joke or a playful banter that feels true to the character can add lightness and entertainment value to dialogue scenes. # 5. Reveal Character and Plot Use dialogue scenes as an opportunity to reveal more about the characters, their backstory, or the plot without resorting to exposition. Let the audience piece things together through what characters choose to say or not say, creating an active viewing experience. # 6. Real Stakes Ensure that the conversations have stakes; the outcome of a dialogue should matter to the characters and the plot. Whether it's convincing someone, uncovering a truth, or making a difficult decision, if the conversation has consequences, it's more engaging. # 7. Dynamic Settings Place dialogue scenes in interesting or dynamic settings that add visual interest or pose challenges for the characters. For example, a heated debate might take place while the characters are hiking up a difficult trail, adding a physical dimension to their emotional and intellectual struggle. # 8. Use of Silence and Non-verbal Communication Remember, communication isn't just verbal. Plays on silence, facial expressions, and body language can say as much, if not more, than words. A knowing look or a pregnant pause can add layers to the scene, making it more compelling. # 9. Callbacks and Running Jokes Develop callbacks to earlier conversations or running gags that build through the narrative. This creates a sense of continuity and in-jokes with the audience, making them feel more connected to the characters and story. # 10. Emotional Variety Vary the emotional tone of dialogue scenes. Mix in moments of tenderness, vulnerability, anger, and joy. A variety of emotional tones keeps the interactions fresh and prevents the narrative from becoming monotonous. # 11. Progression and Development Ensure that each significant dialogue scene changes something - it could progress the plot, deepen character relationships, or transform a character's understanding. Stagnation is the enemy of engagement; conversations should always move the story or characters forward in some way. By weaving these elements into dialogue and character interactions, writers and filmmakers can create scenes that are not only entertaining to watch but also deepen the audience's investment in the characters and the story. These techniques transform dialogue scenes from mere exposition into pivotal, engaging moments."},{"instruction":"True or False: The introduction section of a research manuscript should explain how the current study is going to fill in the gaps and limitations of previous studies.","output":"True."},{"instruction":"The following sentence appeared at the end of the introduction section of a study on sleep and beauty: \\"We hypothesised that untrained observers would perceive sleep deprived people as more tired, less healthy, and less attractive compared with after a normal night’s sleep.\\" Which of the following sentences most likely appeared at the start of the discussion section of the same paper?

Here's your next question: **Which diuretic is considered a potassium-sparing diuretic and is commonly used in conjunction with loop or thiazide diuretics to mitigate hypokalemia?**"},{"instruction":"Spironolactone","output":"Correct! Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which works by antagonizing the effects of aldosterone in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. This action prevents the exchange of sodium for potassium, thereby reducing the excretion of potassium and mitigating the risk of hypokalemia. It is indeed commonly used in conjunction with loop or thiazide diuretics to prevent hypokalemia, especially in patients with heart failure or other conditions requiring long-term diuretic therapy. Would you like another question or is there anything else you'd like to know?"},{"instruction":"Does thiazide and loop diuretics cause hypokalemia","output":"Yes, both thiazide and loop diuretics can cause hypokalemia. Thiazide diuretics decrease the reabsorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule in the kidneys, which leads to an increased excretion of water and sodium. However, their action also increases potassium excretion, which can lead to hypokalemia. Loop diuretics work by inhibiting the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This action blocks the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and potassium ions, leading to increased excretion of these ions and water. The increase in potassium excretion can result in hypokalemia, especially with high doses or prolonged use. Both types of diuretics can disrupt the electrolyte balance, and monitoring of serum potassium levels is often necessary during therapy to manage potential hypokalemia.

The process involves client scripting to capture the selection event and server-side scripting to query the database for related records and their operational statuses. The following outline gives an idea of how to approach this: # 1. Client Script (Catalog Client Script) Firstly, create a Catalog Client Script associated with your catalog item. This script will execute when the \`selected_server\` field changes and will make a GlideAjax call to a Script Include for server-side processing. \`\`\`javascript // Type: onChange // Field Name: selected_server (adjust this according to your actual variable name) if (newValue !== '') { // GlideAjax to call Server-Side Script Include var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckServerRelatedCIs'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'checkOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('selectedServerSysId', newValue); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ var result = answer; if (result) { // Show Popup if result is not empty alert(result); // Customize this as per your needs, you might want to make a nicer modal/pop-up // Clear the 'selected_server' field g_form.setValue('selected_server', '', ''); } }); } \`\`\` # 2. Script Include (Server-side) Create a Script Include that's accessible from client scripts (\`Client Callable\` option checked). This Script Include will take the \`selectedServerSysId\`, use it to find all related records in \`cmdb_rel_ci\` based on IP Address, and check their Operational Status. \`\`\`javascript var CheckServerRelatedCIs = Class.create(); CheckServerRelatedCIs.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkOperationalStatus: function() { var serverSysId = this.getParameter('selectedServerSysId'); var namesOfCIs = []; // Assuming \\"ip_address\\" is the common field and operational status field is simply named \\"operational_status\\" var serverGr = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci_server'); if (serverGr.get(serverSysId)) { var ipAddress = serverGr.getValue('ip_address'); // Adjust the field name accordingly // Query cmdb_rel_ci for related records var relCiGr = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); relCiGr.addQuery('ip_address', ipAddress); // Adjust the query as per your relationship logic relCiGr.query(); while (relCiGr.next()) { if (relCiGr.getValue('operational_status') === 'operational') { // Adjust the condition to match your data namesOfCIs.push(relCiGr.getValue('name')); // Assuming 'name' is the field you want to display } } } return namesOfCIs.join(', '); } }); \`\`\` # Note: - **Field Names & Table Names:** Adjust the field and table names according to what you have in your instance. - **Popup/Modal Customization:** The basic \`alert\` function is used here for simplicity, but you might want to use a more sophisticated custom modal or UI Page for displaying the data. - **Operational Status Logic:** This sample assumes \\"operational_status\\" is a field with the string value \\"operational\\" to indicate an operational status. You'll need to adjust this logic based on how your data is structured. - **Security:** Ensure you have considered security and access control in your Script Include and Client Script to prevent unauthorized access or information disclosure. This setup should cover your requirements, allowing you to dynamically check the operational status of related CIs in the \`cmdb_rel_ci\` table when a server is selected in a catalog item, and prompt the user accordingly."},{"instruction":"var relGlide = new GlideRecord(\\"cmdb_rel_ci); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb30854943^child.ip_address=\\" +current.variables.ip_address; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); workflow.scratchpad.vm_flag = false; while (relGlide.next()){ //if any CI is operational if(relGlide.parent.operational_status ==1){ workflow.scratchpad.vm_flag = true; } } i have this code in my workflow script. please make a client script with the use of this code","output":"Adapting your workflow script into a catalog client script involves several adjustments. The original script seems to perform a check on relationships in the \`cmdb_rel_ci\` table based on a related CI's IP address and sets a flag if any related CI is operational. To transform this logic into a catalog client script, you'd likely want to perform an action based on user interaction, such as changing a field value on the form and dynamically checking the operational status of related CIs accordingly. One crucial point is that direct database queries like you have in your server-side code can't be executed client-side due to security and architecture constraints of ServiceNow. Instead, we will use a \`GlideAjax\` call to execute server-side logic in response to client-side events (such as changing a field value). The following example builds upon that to achieve similar functionality tailored for a catalog item with client-side interaction. # Step 1: Client Script for Catalog Item This client script will trigger when a specific field changes (in this case, hypothetically the \`ip_address\` field of your catalog item), and it will use \`GlideAjax\` to communicate with a Script Include. \`\`\`javascript // Assuming the variable you are tracking is named 'ip_address' // Type: onChange // Field Name: ip_address function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'checkStatus'); ga.addParam('ip_address', newValue); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ if (answer === 'true') { // Assuming you want to perform some action when the condition is met alert('At least one related CI is operational.'); // Here, you could also clear a field, disable a button, etc., depending on your requirement // Example: g_form.setValue('some_field_name', '', ''); } else { // You can handle the negative case here if needed } }); } \`\`\` # Step 2: Script Include for Server-side Logic Create a Script Include that is Client Callable. This server-side script will handle the database querying logic. \`\`\`javascript var CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus = Class.create(); CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkStatus: function() { var ipAddress = this.getParameter('ip_address'); var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb30854943^child.ip_address=\\" + ipAddress; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()){ if (relGlide.parent.operational_status == 1){ return 'true'; // At least one CI is operational } } return 'false'; // No operational CIs found } }); \`\`\` # Notes: - Ensure you replace \`'type=d93304fb30854943^child.ip_address='\` with the actual query you need. The example above assumes a specific relationship type ID and uses dot-walking to access the child's IP address, which might not directly map to your schema. - The script includes a hard-coded relationship type (\`d93304fb30854943\`). You should replace this with the actual type you're interested in querying against. - The script above assumes that checking \`.parent.operational_status == 1\` is the correct way to ascertain operational status. Adjust this based on your actual field names and values. - Remember to replace \`'some_field_name'\` with the actual field you would like to clear or modify based on the check in the client script. By leveraging client-side scripting with \`GlideAjax\`, and server-side processing via Script Includes, you can effectively perform complex checks and update your catalog item form dynamically based on user input and related record statuses."},{"instruction":"on change field name is select_server","output":"Given the updated requirement where the onChange client script should trigger upon changing the \\"select_server\\" field in a ServiceNow catalog item form, the strategy remains largely the same, but we'll adjust the field name to match your specific setup. The goal here is to use client scripting to react to changes in the \`select_server\` field, employ \`GlideAjax\` for server-side logic to check against \`cmdb_rel_ci\` records using server details, and act based on whether any related CI is operational. # Updated Step 1: Client Script for Catalog Item This updated client script is tailored for the \`select_server\` variable. It triggers when the \`select_server\` value changes, sends the server's sys_id to a script include, and processes the response. \`\`\`javascript // Field Name: select_server function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'checkStatusByServerSysId'); ga.addParam('server_sys_id', newValue); // Pass the selected server's sys_id ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ if (answer === 'true') { // At least one related CI is operational alert('At least one related CI is operational.'); // Optional: Clear the 'select_server' field or take other actions g_form.setValue('select_server', '', ''); } else { // Handle the case where no operational CIs are found, if needed } }); } \`\`\` # Updated Step 2: Script Include for Server-side Logic In the script include, the logic will now revolve around finding \`cmdb_rel_ci\` records that are related to the provided server sys_id. Here we assume you're looking to check child entries related to this server by using its sys_id. \`\`\`javascript var CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus = Class.create(); CheckRelatedCIsOperationalStatus.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkStatusByServerSysId: function() { var serverSysId = this.getParameter('server_sys_id'); var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); relGlide.addQuery('parent', serverSysId); // Assuming 'parent' holds the server, adjust to your relationship logic relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { // Assuming the child objects have an 'operational_status' field to check // You'd adjust this to match your CMDB design, possibly involving additional queries if (relGlide.child.operational_status == '1') { // Presuming '1' signifies operational return 'true'; // At least one related CI is operational } } return 'false'; // No operational CIs found } }); \`\`\` # Important Notes - Ensure that you replace the placeholder logic (e.g., \`parent\`, \`child.operational_status\`, etc.) with the actual relationship and field names based on your CMDB's design. This includes whether you're looking at child or parent relations, and how operational status is defined. - Validate that the field used in \`g_form.setValue\` in the client script matches exactly with the variable name used in the catalog item for it to clear correctly. - The \`alert\` function is utilized for its simplicity in demonstrating user feedback. In a production environment, consider using more user-friendly and accessible methods for notifications, such as ServiceNow's \`g_form.addInfoMessage()\` for informational messages. This approach enables a dynamic check on related CIs' operational statuses when a server is selected in your ServiceNow catalog item, enhancing the interactivity and data validity of your service request process."},{"instruction":"python code for addition of two numbers","output":"Certainly!
