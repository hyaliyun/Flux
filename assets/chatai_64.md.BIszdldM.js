This bold title brings a unique blend of humor, action, and a pinch of dark comedy to the classic Wii, a console beloved by millions for its family-friendly games and innovative motion controls. Despite the Wii’s discontinuation years ago, the console remains popular among retro gaming enthusiasts and families alike. Rodriguez’s game taps into this nostalgia, offering a unique experience that diverges significantly from the console's typical fare. *Wii Are Resorting to Violence* is described by its creator as “a love letter to the Wii, with a twist nobody saw coming.” The game parodies the popular *Wii Sports Resort*, transforming its serene island setting into a chaotic battleground where players engage in over-the-top combat sports. From fencing with baguettes to dodgeball using watermelons, Rodriguez's game injects a dose of absurdity and wit into the Wii’s game library. \\"I grew up playing the Wii, and it's always had a special place in my heart,\\" Rodriguez shared in an interview. \\"With *Wii Are Resorting to Violence*, I wanted to pay homage to those memories while also making something that stands out as entirely its own beast. It's been a thrilling challenge to develop this game, ensuring that it resonates with long-time fans of the console and newcomers looking for something out of the ordinary.\\" Rodriguez's approach to game development was unorthodox. Leveraging open-source tools and a deep understanding of the Wii’s hardware, he single-handedly crafted the game’s mechanics, art, and programming. The game’s announcement was initially met with skepticism, but upon release, it quickly gained a following, praised for its ingenuity, humor, and how it breathes new life into the Wii’s game catalog. Critics and gamers alike have lauded *Wii Are Resorting to Violence* for its creative gameplay, tight controls, and how it manages to maintain a balance between reverence for its source material and its unique, edgy flavor. “It’s rare to see such a daring game come out for a console that’s been out of the spotlight for so long,” remarked Alex Chen, editor of the online gaming magazine Pixelated. “Rodriguez has not only paid a fitting tribute to the Wii but has also shown that there's still room for innovation and surprise in the world of gaming.” Gaming forums and social media platforms are abuzz with discussions about the game, with many users sharing their favorite moments and the hilariously unexpected ways they’ve found to defeat their opponents. Beyond its entertainment value, *Wii Are Resorting to Violence* has sparked conversations about the potential for indie games to revitalize interest in older gaming systems. Rodriguez has expressed his astonishment at the game's positive reception and hinted at possible future projects. “The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and it's inspired me to explore what else might be possible,” he stated, leaving many wondering what the future might hold for this innovative developer and the beloved Wii console. *Wii Are Resorting to Violence* is available in limited quantities, mainly sold through Rodriguez’s website, and has quickly become a sought-after collector's item for fans of the console and indie games. As Rodriguez continues to pave his path in the gaming industry, his debut title stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Wii and the limitless creativity of indie game developers."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Children's Film Foundation film - 2 Bumbling burglars (played by known comic actors , like Barker or Cribbins) are attempting to \\"case\\" a mansion, only to be thwarted by the 'ghosts' ( schoolchildren playing pranks on them) at every oppurtunity...

This unexpected move marks the first time in the company’s history that such a hardware-specific restriction has been applied, leaving millions of Nintendo Switch owners bewildered and concerned about the future of their gaming experience. During a press conference held at Nintendo’s headquarters in Kyoto, the company’s president, Hiroshi Yakamoto (a fictional character), unveiled the new policy, which will take effect starting next month. According to Yakamoto, this decision was made to “enhance the gaming experience by tailoring Joy-Con features and services to the unique preferences and regulatory requirements of different global markets.” Yakamoto further explained that the region lock would not affect the majority of current Joy-Con colors and limited editions. However, future releases, including special editions and Joy-Cons with new functionalities, will be region-specific. This means that these new controllers will only operate with Nintendo Switch consoles sold in the same region. The reaction from the Nintendo community has been overwhelmingly negative, with many gamers taking to social media to express their frustration and disappointment. The hashtag #FreeTheJoyCons has already started trending on Twitter, with users calling for Nintendo to reconsider their decision. “This move feels unnecessarily restrictive and anti-consumer,” said Alex Martinez (a fictional character), a lifelong Nintendo fan and host of the popular gaming podcast, “The Virtual Lobby.” “The beauty of the Switch is its versatility and the way it unites gamers across the globe. Region-locking Joy-Cons seems like a step back from that ethos.” Nintendo’s decision also raises questions about the impact on collectors and gamers who frequently travel between regions. Many fear that it will complicate the process of acquiring limited edition controllers and could potentially lead to increased prices in secondary markets as enthusiasts scramble to obtain rare or region-specific models. Some industry analysts speculate that Nintendo’s move could be linked to upcoming functionalities that require strict regulatory compliance, or possibly as a means to combat piracy and modding communities. However, without clearer explanations from Nintendo, the gaming community is left with more questions than answers. Nintendo has stated that they plan to release more details in the coming weeks, including a list of the first batch of region-locked Joy-Con controllers and guidelines for travelers and international buyers. The company reassures that they are listening to the feedback and asks for patience as they navigate this new policy. As the news continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Nintendo’s surprising decision has pushed the gaming industry into uncharted waters. How this will affect the company’s relationship with its loyal fan base and the broader gaming market remains to be seen. Stay tuned to our website for further updates and reactions from the gaming community and industry experts.

Amid the ongoing backlash, voices within the gaming community have begun drawing parallels between this latest decision and the infamous struggles of Nintendo's previous generation console, the Wii U, specifically its GamePad controller. One prominent voice contributing to this conversation is Jordan Lee (a fictional character), an influential tech blogger and avid gamer, who recently published an op-ed titled “Nintendo’s Joy-Con Region Lock: The GamePad Déjà Vu.” In their piece, Lee argues that Nintendo is repeating the mistakes of the past and potentially jeopardizing the Switch’s massive success. “The Wii U’s GamePad was a bold move that ultimately fell flat due to poor execution and lack of third-party support. Now, with the Joy-Con region lock, Nintendo seems to be taking another risky gamble that could alienate its global fan base,” Lee writes. They further caution, “It’s like the GamePad debacle all over again, where innovation is hindered by unnecessary restrictions and consumer dissatisfaction.” The GamePad, introduced with the Wii U console in 2012, was criticized for its bulky design and the system's inability to leverage its unique features effectively. While not a direct comparison in technology, Lee and other gamers see a thematic similarity in how these decisions might affect consumer trust and the company’s reputation. Social media and gaming forums have erupted in discussions, with many echoing Lee’s sentiments. Fans who had stood by Nintendo through the Wii U era expressing concern that the company might be losing sight of what made the Switch a universally beloved console: its accessibility and openness. Debate club forums at universities and gaming conventions are abuzz, with sessions planned to discuss the implications of Nintendo's decision. \\"It's a pivotal moment for us to analyze and understand the dynamics between gaming innovation, consumer freedom, and corporate strategy,\\" said Maya Chen (a fictional character), a debate club president at a well-known university. However, some remain hopeful that Nintendo will listen to the feedback, as it eventually did with the Wii U by shifting its focus to the development of the Switch. “Nintendo is known for taking bold risks, but they’re also good at adapting. Let’s not forget how they turned things around with the Switch after the Wii U,” commented an optimistic gamer on a popular YouTube gaming channel’s discussion thread. As the conversation grows, it's clear that the gaming community is looking closely at Nintendo's next moves. Whether the Joy-Con region lock will indeed mirror the GamePad’s history or pave the way for unexpected positive developments remains a hot topic among gamers worldwide. Nintendo has yet to respond to the comparisons with the Wii U GamePad or address the growing concerns among its fans. With the company’s history of innovation and overcoming challenges, the gaming world watches eagerly, hoping for a resolution that keeps the beloved aspects of the Switch intact.

This digital kerfuffle was sparked by a photograph, but dear readers, this was no ordinary photograph. Now, Featherstone itself harbored a resident by the name of Gerald, an individual whose life was as thrilling as a lecture on watching grass grow, given by an expert in the art of drying paint. Gerald, a middle-aged chap with a balding pate and a wardrobe that screamed “I give up,” was known for his thrillingly predictable existence. His goldfish, a critic of minimal word but discerning taste, found Gerald’s routine so uninspiring it often performed the aquatic equivalent of rolling its eyes. However, destiny, with its quirky sense of humor, chose an extraordinarily mundane Wednesday to throw Gerald into the limelight. On this day, which was as average as they come, save for being slightly more humid than usual—a condition that left everyone feeling like they’d been slapped with a lukewarm fish—Gerald decided to amble down the path less ordered and procure a sandwich dubbed “The Gastronomic Enigma” from a newfangled delicatessen. This sandwich was a concoction so ambitiously assembled it was rumored to have been crafted by moonlight, under the influence of culinary madness, featuring an array of meats so exotic they’d make a seasoned traveler blush, cheeses with names unpronounceable by the average tongue, and greens that aspired to the exotic but were, essentially, just well-dressed lettuce. In a moment of uncharacteristic spontaneity (spurred, perhaps, by the midlife crisis that had been politely knocking on his door), Gerald captured the moment with a photograph. There he stood, an everyman hero beside his battle-station, armed with nothing but a stapler and the company of a particularly morose potted plant, lifting “The Gastronomic Enigma” high. To the untrained eye, the sandwich bore an uncanny resemblance to a mischievous smirk. Uploaded to the deserted wasteland of Gerald’s social media profile with the rally cry of “Braving the unknown. #LunchAdventures,” what followed was akin to discovering that the mundane hat you’ve been wearing for ages was, in fact, a wizard’s hat that accidentally turned caterpillars into rampant, meme-spreading butterflies overnight. The image of Gerald, poised to duel with culinary ambition, catapulted across the digital ether, sparking a wildfire of memes, homages, and philosophical musings. “Doing a Gerald” swiftly became the vernacular for embarking on adventures so minute they previously went unnoticed, like opting for a different brand of dental floss or flirting with the anarchic thrill of choosing a different seat on the bus. Philosophers, having exhausted debates on more traditional existential crises, latched onto Gerald’s sandwich saga as a metaphor for humanity’s ceaseless pursuit of meaning in a buffet of mundanity. The sandwich—The Gastronomic Enigma—became a vessel for existential discourse, with late-night talk show pundits pontificating, “Are we not all, in essence, sandwiches in the deli of life?” Caught in the eye of this digital storm, Gerald found himself an unwitting poster child for the philosophy of the profoundly ordinary. Yet, despite the bewildering fame, a shift occurred within him. This meme-fueled odyssey imparted onto Gerald a sense of purpose, a newfound appreciation for the hidden adventures in life’s minutiae. As quickly as it had ascended to the zenith of viral stardom, Gerald’s tale gently descended into the archives of internet folklore, replaced by the next fleeting marvel. But Gerald’s journey was far from over. Emboldened by his accidental enlightenment, Gerald chronicled his newfound appreciation for the mundane on his social media, turning it into a veritable expedition log of the everyday. Each post, whether it be “The Great Stapler Reorganization Odyssey” or “The Chronicle of the Uncharted Bus Stop,” was a testament to the extraordinary that resides within the ordinary. Then, on a day of no particular importance, as Gerald grappled with the existential implications of a knitting project gone awry, he received a notification that would once again tilt his world. The Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment—curator of the commonplace turned spectacular—had extended an invitation for Gerald to exhibit his adventures. This invitation, cloaked in artistically meta layers, was itself a commentary on the blurring lines between the mundane and the magnificent, a critique of the value we assign to virality versus authenticity. Thus, Gerald’s journey of self-discovery and accidental fame culminated in an art exhibition aptly titled “The Heroism of the Humdrum.” Here, amidst the hallowed halls far from the mundanity of Featherstone, visitors were invited to ponder the profound nestled within the prosaic, as embodied by Gerald’s adventures. As the exhibition drew to a close, Gerald returned to Featherstone, his spirit enriched, his perspective irrevocably altered. He had discovered that true adventure doesn’t demand grand gestures; it requires merely the willingness to recognize the magic hidden in the monotony. And the viral sandwich saga? It persisted in the ether, a quaint relic of a time when an ordinary man and his extraordinary sandwich captured the digital zeitgeist, a reminder that within every prosaic existence lies the potential for an epic narrative. In the grand tapestry of Featherstone, even the goldfish found itself contemplating the adventures that might lie beyond the glass of its bowl, inspired by the tale of Gerald and his Gastronomic Enigma. For in the end, Gerald’s story was not just a tale of a man and his sandwich; it was a narrative about embracing the narrative within, however seemingly insignificant, and sharing it with the world.\\" Please write an at least 1200-word humorous short story in my style with the following aspects: Humor, originality, Intriguing concept, thought-provoking theme, philosophical undertones, universal appeal, emotional impact, memorable and strong relatable characters, engaging dialog, and a surprise twist ending. The story should have an effective use of language, descriptions, pacing, and structure. Make sure the story has a surprise twist ending. Mix short and long sentences to create rhythm and maintain reader interest. Be mindful of the flow and pacing of the story. Do not follow the pattern of or reference the story above in any way. Keep the characters unique, different from the story above. Important! Don’t start the story referencing where the story takes place (a town, village, etc…). Just use my style. Ensure the story will win any writing contest. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the story I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Important! The story must be at least 1200 words, but not more than 3000 words. Important! Prompt me to continue after each 400 words. At the start of each continuation, label that continuation as a Chapter. When the story ends and there are no more chapters, print “The End” Center the story around a character named Gus and his personal exploration into his new hobby of breeding ugly dogs and selling them to people wishing to have a dog to enter in Ugly Dog competitions.","output":"Certainly! Let's embark on this adventure. --- Gus, a man of peculiar inclinations and a fervent believer in the adage that beauty is, indeed, in the eye of the beholder, found himself at the precipice of a life-altering epiphany during one swelteringly mundane afternoon. The world, in its infinite jest, had conspired to position him at this juncture, a place where his latent passion for the unattractive aspects of canine companions would soon unfold into a tale most unconventional. Residing in a dwelling that bore the hallmarks of someone who embraced the chaos of existence with open arms, Gus lived amidst an eclectic assortment of bric-a-brac that ranged from mildly interesting to downright bizarre. His life, much like his living quarters, was a tapestry woven from the threads of the unexpected and the ordinary. Chapter 1: It all began when Gus, on a whim that could only be described as a stroke of genius or madness (depending on one’s perspective), decided to adopt a dog so singularly unappealing that it prompted gasps of horror and fascination in equal measure. This dog, whom he christened \\"Beelzebub\\" for its devilishly odd appearance, was not merely a pet but the harbinger of Gus’s newly discovered calling—breeding ugly dogs. The idea, both preposterous and brilliant, came to him as he observed Beelzebub, whose face had enough asymmetry to make Picasso blush and a coat that seemed to defy the very concept of grooming. Gus pondered, quite philosophically, on the relentless pursuit of perfection in the world of dog breeding. He questioned why symmetry and pedigree should dictate the worth of a canine companion when there was a certain charm in the imperfections, a beauty in the unconventional. Prompted by this revelation, Gus embarked upon his quest with Beelzebub as his muse. He sought out the most unusual dog breeds, those shunned by traditional dog shows, and began his breeding program. The endeavor was not without its challenges, for the world was yet to see the value in his vision. Chapter 2: In time, word of Gus’s unique undertaking began to spread, carried by the winds of curiosity and incredulity. People from all walks of life, from eccentric collectors to artists seeking inspiration in the imperfect, flocked to his door. Each person saw something different in Gus’s dogs—a reflection of their own quirks, perhaps, or a statement against the prevailing standards of beauty. Gus, for his part, found immense satisfaction in his work. He did not merely breed dogs; he curated a collection of living, breathing works of art. Each dog, with its peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, was a testament to the diversity of nature and a poke in the eye to conventionality. His reputation grew, and with it, the demand for his dogs. The Ugly Dog competitions, once a niche event, became the stage upon which Gus’s dogs shone. These contests, celebrating the unconventional appeal of dogs that would never feature on a traditional show dog podium, became the arena where Gus and his canine companions achieved a peculiar form of celebrity. Chapter 3: However, as is often the case, with great notoriety comes great scrutiny. The world of dog breeding, long governed by strict standards and an unwavering pursuit of perfection, cast a critical eye on Gus’s endeavors. Critics accused him of mockery, of undermining the noble pursuit of dog breeding for mere amusement. Gus faced these criticisms with a stoicism that belied his otherwise genial nature. He argued, with a persuasive eloquence, that beauty was multifaceted and subjective. He presented his dogs not as anomalies but as embodiments of diversity, challenging the preconceived notions of attractiveness. His dogs, he contended, were as deserving of admiration as the most pristine of show dogs, for they carried with them a story, a character, and an allure uniquely their own. The discourse surrounding Gus and his ugly dogs stirred the pot of philosophical thought. Debates emerged on the nature of beauty, the ethics of breeding for aesthetics, and the value of diversity versus conformity. Gus, once a mere enthusiast of the unconventional, found himself at the center of a cultural shift, a movement that questioned longstanding ideals and championed the beauty in difference. As the debate raged on, Gus continued his work, undeterred. The demand for his dogs grew, transcending the initial curiosity and becoming a genuine appreciation for their unorthodox appeal. People began to see what Gus had seen all along—that there was a certain majesty in embracing imperfection, a lesson in humility and acceptance that transcended the realm of dog breeding. Chapter 4: And then, the twist that no one, not even Gus, could have anticipated. During a routine visit to a local animal shelter, seeking potential additions to his eclectic family, Gus stumbled upon a dog so staggeringly beautiful that it seemed as though the heavens themselves had crafted it as a challenge to his convictions. This dog, with its symmetrical features and coat that shimmered like a pool of liquid gold, was the antithesis of everything Gus had championed. The irony was not lost on him. Here he was, the champion of the ugly dog, faced with a creature that embodied the pinnacle of canine beauty. The encounter forced Gus to confront the foundations of his beliefs, to question whether his advocacy for the unattractive had blinded him to the simple joys of beauty in its most conventional form. And so, in a decision that surprised many, Gus adopted the beautiful dog, welcoming it into his fold with the same enthusiasm he had shown to every other dog he had taken in. This act, seemingly at odds with his mission, served as the ultimate testament to his philosophy—embracing diversity in all its forms, not as a rejection of beauty, but as an acknowledgment of its many faces. The inclusion of this dog in Gus’s otherwise unconventional pack did not dilute his message but rather enriched it. It underscored the idea that appreciation for the unconventional need not come at the exclusion of the traditional. Gus’s motley crew of dogs, ranging from the breathtakingly ugly to the traditionally beautiful, became a living symbol of inclusivity and acceptance. The buzz surrounding Gus and his eclectic collection of canines reached a crescendo, capturing the imagination of a society increasingly weary of rigid standards and hungry for authenticity. Gus, through his unlikely journey, had sparked a conversation that transcended the realm of dog breeding, touching upon deeper themes of beauty, diversity, and acceptance.

La nuit, dense et muette, semblait avoir avalé leur fils en un clin d'œil. La mère, les mains tremblantes, porta une main à sa bouche, tentant de retenir un cri de terreur, tandis que le père, plus pragmatique mais non moins inquiet, alluma rapidement une lanterne. « Nous devons le retrouver, coûte que coûte », s'exclama-t-il, sa voix trahissant une urgence palpable. Ils se mirent en route, guidés par la faible lumière de la lanterne, appelant Charlot à tue-tête, leurs voix se perdant dans l'immensité de la nuit. Le village, endormi sous un ciel sans lune, ne répondit pas à leurs appels désespérés. Les ruelles étroites et sinueuses paraissaient s'étendre à l'infini, créant un labyrinthe d'ombres et de mystères. Malgré la peur et l'épuisement, les parents de Charlot persévérèrent, refusant d'abandonner l'espoir de retrouver leur enfant. Leur quête les mena dans des recoins du village qu'ils n'avaient jamais explorés, des places oubliées et des jardins cachés. Et puis, tout à coup, au détour d'une ancienne fontaine, ils l'entendirent. Un faible murmure, presque imperceptible, comme porté par le vent : « Maman, papa… ». Ils accoururent vers la source de la voix et trouvèrent Charlot, recroquevillé dans l'ombre d'un grand chêne, ses yeux brillants de larmes sous la lumière de la lanterne. Le soulagement les submergea, si puissant qu'ils en oublièrent leur colère et leur peur. Ils s'empressèrent de serrer leur fils dans leurs bras, murmurant des mots de réconfort. « Mais pourquoi, Charlot ? Pourquoi nous as-tu fait une telle frayeur ? » Le père essaya de garder une voix ferme, mais l'émotion perçait à travers chaque mot. Charlot, les yeux baissés, mordilla sa lèvre inférieure avant de répondre dans un souffle, « Je voulais être un grand explorateur, découvrir des secrets cachés et vivre des aventures. Je ne pensais pas à quel point cela vous inquiéterait. » Les parents échangèrent un regard, mêlant reproche et soulagement. Ils comprirent alors que leur fils, poussé par la soif d'aventure et la curiosité, cherchait simplement à s'affirmer et à grandir. « Eh bien, mon bonhomme », dit le père en posant doucement sa main sur l'épaule de Charlot, « les grandes aventures commencent souvent par de petits pas. Et parfois, elles se trouvent plus près que l'on ne croit. Mais quel que soit le chemin que tu choisiras, nous serons toujours là pour t'accompagner, veiller sur toi. » Alors que l'aube commençait à peindre le ciel de teintes douces, la petite famille se dirigea vers leur maison, leurs pas légers bercés par l'espoir et l'amour. Cette nuit d'aventure resterait gravée dans leur mémoire, un rappel poignant que parfois, l'exploration la plus importante est celle qui mène au cœur des liens qui nous unissent."},{"instruction":"请将“After attempts at a partial legal reform had been defeated for a while along with the Revolution, influential demands for the universal application and actual upholding of the law were directed above all against royal prerogative power and the private possession of office - this last bearing on members of the ruling estates. The character of law as domination was not denied in this way, and certainly not abolished. At most, it was subjected to religious and moralistic interpretations. The same went for the practice of legislation. What is particularly relevant for our purpose here is the unconcealed char-acter of strategies of estate rule in relation to the economically and socially advancing urban population. Under the Restoration, the crown could always count on the support of Parliament (especially the House of Lords) for politi-cally controlling the town authorities. In 1661, the decision was made to dis-arm some towns and demolish their walls.271 The most important instrument of this policy of control, however, was the enforcement of religious conformity. As early as 1661 - i.e. several years before the general Test Act - it was inscribed in the Corporation Act that all urban office-holders had to publicly disavow the Covenant (and with it any Presbyterian tendencies of faith) and take an oath to renounce political opposition under all circumstances.272 Along with the re-establishment of the old structures of suffrage and parliamentary constituencies, as well as the changes to town administrations that the crown implemented in the following years, this meant a comprehensive attack on any urban radicalism, whether real or simply feared. As Western has shown,273 the success of this strategy was considerable but not total. Although known radical office-holders were removed from their positions in many towns (fourteen of them for example in Reading), this did not guarantee that replacements could always be found. It was in the towns above all that the practice arose in the following decades of 'occasional conformity', by which - with the tacit support of influential citizens - the religious provisions of the government could be met without disturbing the interest of local rule and security.274 As Western rightly points out, all the disciplinary measures taken against the towns could finally not prevent - in the ‘exclusion crisis' of the 1680s - the victory of the Whigs in three successive elections that were held under heavy political influence. This electoral success however did not prevent the complete political triumph of the king over the Whigs. He managed this because for those members of the politically dominant estates who first of all demanded the exclusion of a Catholic from succession to the throne, then requested this and eventually even almost prayed for it, the stability of the system of domination overrode any other consideration, no matter how important this might be. The stability of estate rule is shown once again, therefore, in the political defeat of the Whigs. It was this stability that was then ‘preserved' in the revolution of 1688 - in the view of the Whigs who participated in this.275 Partial depersonalisation of the crown In 1649 the King of England, Charles I, was beheaded. It is likely, therefore, that both his successors in the house of Stuart occasionally felt an unpleasant feeling in the back of the neck. But this did not make them well-disposed towards Parliament; quite the contrary. The reigns of the later Stuarts were marked by a political offensive of the crown, which was to a large extent suc-cessful. Since Charles II did not want to go on his travels a second time, he struggled to raise a standing army, to control the militia, to politically control town governments and to improve the royal administration. His successor took over all this, developed it further, and - above all after the Monmouth rebellion of 1685 - sought to build up the forcible means of royal rule in such a way as to make the power of the English crown comparable for the first time with that of France. A policy of this kind became possible because very many members of the ruling estates had come round to support the politics of order after their expe-riences in the two previous decades, so that for them royal authority was beyond question. They denied any right of resistance, and demanded passive obedience even if royal decrees went against divine commandments.276 The Anglican clergy played an influential role in the theoretical justification of divine right. The linkage of crown and church, which in the 1640s had acceler-ated the developing crisis, was restored in its full scope in 1660. The extent of personal power is shown by the way that Charles II was able to triumph over the dominant political and religious tendencies in the so- called ‘exclusion crisis'. The crisis arose because leading politicians sought to limit the king's personal power by a religious control. Though they laid no claim to any extensive parliamentary participation in government, and rejected the right of resistance, they did seek guarantees for the ‘lawful' practice of royal arbitrariness. In the prevailing conception, these lay in the king's confession of the correct - i.e. Anglican - faith. It was feared therefore that the king's pro-Catholic brother James, if he succeeded to the throne, would follow the instructions of the Catholic church and not those of an Anglican-formed conscience. A considerable part of the ‘political nation' thus demanded that the king should exclude his brother from the throne, precisely because they did not consider it possible, in the words of Sir William Pulteney, ‘to divide the person of the king from the power of kingship'.277 Lord Russell's view was exemplary of the champions of ‘exclusion'. He was against allowing the accession to the throne and demanding as compensation particular limitations of the prerogative in order to secure an Anglican practice of government: for ‘it is very much better for the inner order of the kingdom to have a king with prerogative powers than to have a king deprived of these powers, as in this way lasting resentment and unavoidable conflict will arise'.278 Parliament demanded that Charles II should change the succession to the throne - an immense encroachment on the dynastic structure of personal rule. This shows that, in the second half of the seventeenth century, a considerable part of the ruling estates (and, in this case, as is also evident in the popular support for the Monmouth rebellion, not only the ruling ones), deemed certain preconditions for the practice of personal sovereignty to be necessary and even indispensable, whether or not they were achievable. To counter this, Charles II first of all tried three times to get a Parliament elected that was favourable to him. He then governed without Parliament, and achieved the succession of his brother. In the first years of his reign, James II was, in many respects, more powerful than any English king before him. The 'resolution' of the exclusion crisis meant the victory of the king over the majority in Parliament. Those who upheld the king's position during the crisis described the champions of the majority position insultingly as Whigs. Political influence, however, is not necessarily a zero-sum game. The expan-sion of royal prerogative power in the second half of the seventeenth century did not mean a fundamental disempowerment of Parliament. Even the parlia-ment of the first Restoration decade, which was not accidentally described as the 'Cavalier' Parliament, on many particular questions set limits to the per-sonal rule of the king that was basically recognised and seen as necessary. A decisive precondition for such a policy arose from the generalisation of politi-cal debate that had arisen in the Revolution years, and which, despite the restoration of generalised estate (and thus in the main locally organised) rule, had still not been suppressed. Even if this was not readily apparent in the first years of the stabilisation policy, nor in the decade after 1689, by the mid-seventeenth century English politics came to be characterised by a system of factions. This development provided a structural precondition - independent of the concrete possession of power by the king - for the de-personalisation of monarchical power. What was specifically involved here was the formation of political conflicts that were characterised by representatives of a particular viewpoint struggling with those of another viewpoint over the policy to be carried out. This had, of course, been the case - occasionally and embryoni- cally - long before the Revolution. But, whereas previous political conflicts had been inevitably structured by competition for influence over the king, after the Revolution this condition was partly dissolved. It is precisely here that we can see the constitution of a political public sphere, and, to this extent, the development of forms of political communication in which interests can only hope to win agreement if they can represent themselves in at least some sense as 'general'. This emergence of structures of a public sphere is both the social precondition for the rise of political ideologies and the result of it. (Which is why the critique of ideologies - understood as the critique of social-political programmes - finds its first real historical basis with the critique of personal forms of rule.) The fact that, despite the far-reaching restoration of royal prerogative power, this formation of a political public which had been the precondition for the Revolution and had structured its course (at least in so far as it affected the ruling and ascendant estates) could not be completely abolished, is shown by a further contradiction characteristic of the structure of power at this time: the Whigs and the Tories, as supporters of the different political viewpoints first pejoratively labelled each other, before the labels were adopted by the parties themselves, contended in the ‘exclusion crisis' over the modalities of collaboration (!) between royal personal power and generalised estate rule. The crown took account of these altered structures. During the reigns of the last two Stuart kings, attempts to influence the composition and decisions of Parliament very largely took the place of earlier constitutional conflicts. The increased importance of Parliament was noticeable in the systematic political distribution of pensions and offices. Parliament now actually represented an (estate-limited) public. It had become the institutional expression of a notion of ‘good rule', which integrated royal personal rule with generalised estate rule and sought to subject it to this. That the personal rule of the king, though restored after the Revolution, was at the same time redefined, is shown among other things by the revision of the penalties for high treason. As early as 1640, Chief Justice Finch was con-demned for ‘treason against the king as well as against the kingdom' (author's emphasis), and moreover with the argument that everything ‘whatever is against the whole, is undoubtedly against the head'.279 An offence of state treason that had not been previously defined was thus reinterpreted as an injury to personal obligations towards the king. Eight years later, Charles I was condemned for high treason ‘in the name of the people of England', and under the Restoration, a broad - state-oriented - interpretation of treasonable behaviour remained with the introduction of ‘rebellious speech'.”翻译为中文","output":"在部分法律改革尝试在革命中一度被击败后，针对普遍适用和真正维护法律的有影响力的要求，主要是针对王权特权和官职私有化的——后者影响到统治阶层成员。以这种方式，并未否认法律作为统治的特性，当然也没有废除。最多，它受到了宗教和道德解释的制约。立法实践也是如此。对我们当前目的特别相关的是，针对经济和社会上升的城市人口，地产统治策略的公然特征。在复辟时期，王冠总能依靠议会（特别是上议院）的支持，政治控制城市当局。1661年，决定解除一些城市的武装并拆除它们的城墙。然而，这一控制政策最重要的工具是强制宗教一致性。早在1661年——即在普遍的测试法案前几年——公司法案规定，所有城市官员必须公开放弃盟约（以及任何长老宗信仰倾向）并宣誓在任何情况下放弃政治反对。随着皇冠在接下来的几年中重新建立选举权旧结构和议会选区，以及对城市行政的改变，这意味着对任何实际或仅是被担心的城市激进主义的全面攻击。正如Western所展示的，这一策略虽然取得了相当大的成功，但并不是完全成功。尽管许多城市已知的激进派官员被撤职（例如在雷丁就有十四位），但这并不能保证总能找到替代者。在接下来的几十年中，尤其是在城市中兴起了“偶尔的一致性”做法，借助有影响力市民的默许支持，政府的宗教规定得以满足，而不干扰地方统治和安全的利益。Western正确地指出，所有针对城市采取的纪律措施最终都未能阻止——在1680年代的“排除危机”中——在重大政治影响下举行的三次连续选举中，辉格党取得胜利。然而，这一选举成功并未阻止国王对辉格党的完全政治胜利。他之所以能够做到这一点，是因为对于那些首先要求排除一个天主教徒继承王位，然后提出这一要求，最终几乎祈求此事的政治上占主导地位的阶层成员而言，地产统治体系的稳定超越了任何其他考虑，无论这些考虑可能有多重要。因此，再次表明了地产统治的稳定性，在辉格党政治失败中。正是这种稳定性在1688年的革命中得以“保留”——在参与这一革命的辉格党人看来。 国王权力的部分去人格化 1649年，英格兰国王查理一世被处决。因此，他的两位斯图亚特家族的继任者可能偶尔会感觉到脖子后部有不愉快的感觉。但这并没有使他们对议会产生好感；恰恰相反。后来的斯图亚特王朝的统治标志着王冠发动的一场在很大程度上成功的政治攻势。查理二世不想第二次流亡，他努力筹建常备军，控制民兵，政治控制城市政府，并改善皇家行政。他的继任者接管了所有这些，进一步发展，并且——特别是在1685年蒙茅斯叛乱之后——寻求建立强制性的皇家统治手段，使英格兰王冠的力量首次与法国相媲美。 正是因为许多统治阶层成员在过去二十年的经历后转而支持秩序政治，使得这类政策成为可能，以至于他们毫无疑问地支持王权。他们否认任何抵抗权，即使皇家法令违反神圣命令也要求被动服从。圣公会神职人员在神授权理论的论证中扮演了重要角色。1640年代加速发展的危机中，皇冠与教会的联系在1660年完全恢复。 个人权力的程度体现在查理二世在所谓的“排除危机”中战胜了主要的政治和宗教趋势上。这场危机是因为主要政治家试图通过宗教控制来限制国王的个人权力。尽管他们没有要求广泛的议会参与政府，并且拒绝了抵抗权，但他们确实寻求保证“合法”的皇家专断实践。在普遍的概念中，这些保证在于国王对正确的——即圣公会——信仰的承认。因此，人们担心国王的亲天主教兄弟詹姆斯，如果他继承了王位，将遵循天主教会的指示，而不是圣公会形成的良知的指示。因此，“政治国家”的相当一部分人因此要求国王排除他的兄弟继承王位，正是因为他们认为，用威廉·普尔特尼爵士的话说，“将国王的个人与王权分开是不可能的”。罗素勋爵代表了“排除”的拥护者的观点，他反对允许王位的继承，并要求作为补偿特别限制特权以确保圣公会政府的实践：“对国内秩序而言，拥有特权的国王要比被剥夺这些权力的国王好得多，因为这样会引起持久的怨恨和不可避免的冲突”。议会要求查理二世改变继承顺序——这是对个人统治的王朝结构的巨大侵犯。这表明，在十七世纪下半叶，相当一部分统治阶层（在这种情况下，如蒙茅斯叛乱的民众支持所示，不仅仅是统治阶层）认为，个人主权实践的某些前提是必要甚至不可或缺的，无论它们是否能够实现。为了对抗这一点，查理二世首先尝试了三次选举一个对他有利的议会。然后他不经过议会治国，并实现了他的兄弟的继承。詹姆斯二世在他的统治初年，在许多方面比任何一个英格兰国王都更有权力。“排除危机”的“解决”意味着国王在议会多数中的胜利。在危机期间支持国王立场的人贬低地将多数立场的拥护者称为辉格党。 然而，政治影响力并不一定是零和游戏。十七世纪下半叶王权特权力量的扩张并不意味着议会的根本性削弱。即使是第一个复辟十年的议会，它并不是偶然被称为“骑士”议会，在许多具体问题上限制了基本上被认可且被视为必要的国王的个人统治。这种政策的一个决定性前提源于在革命年代产生的政治辩论的普遍化，尽管在恢复了一般的地产（因此主要是地方组织的）统治后，这种普遍化还没有被压制。即使在稳定政策的最初几年和1689年之后的十年中这并不容易察觉，到了十七世纪中叶，英格兰政治的特点是由一个派系体系。这一发展提供了一个结构性的前提——独立于国王的具体权力拥有情况——为君主权力的去人格化。具体而言，这里涉及到的是由代表特定观点的代表与其他观点代表就要执行的政策进行斗争的政治冲突的形成。当然，这种情况在革命之前——偶尔和萌芽地——长期存在。但是，尽管以前的政治冲突不可避免地由争夺对国王影响力的竞争构成，但革命后这种情况部分解除了。正是在这里，我们可以看到政治公共领域的构建，从这个意义上说，政治沟通的形式发展了，其中利益只有在至少某种程度上能够将自己表述为“普遍”的情况下才能希望获得同意。政治意识形态的出现既是社会前提也是其结果的这些公共领域结构的出现。（这就是为什么意识形态批判——理解为对社会政治计划的批判——在对个人统治形式的批判中找到了其第一次真正的历史基础。）尽管极大地恢复了王权特权力量，但这种为革命提供前提并构成其进程的（至少在涉及到统治和上升的阶层时）政治公共形式不能被完全废除，这一点从当时的权力结构的另一个矛盾中可以看出：辉格党和托利党作为不同政治观点的支持者，最初相互贬低地标记对方，然后这些标签被各自的党派采用，在“排除危机”中争夺（！）皇家个人权力与一般地产统治之间的合作方式。 皇冠考虑到了这些变化的结构。在最后两位斯图亚特国王的统治期间，试图影响议会的组成和决定在很大程度上取代了之前的宪法冲突。议会的重要性在系统性的政治派发津贴和官职中显现出来。议会现在实际上代表了一个（有地产限制的）公众。它成为了一种“良好统治”观念的制度表达，该观念将王权个人统治与一般地产统治结合在一起，并试图将其纳入此中。 尽管在革命后恢复了国王的个人统治，但国王的个人统治同时被重新定义，这一点表现在对叛国罪处罚的修正上。早在1640年，首席法官芬奇就因“对国王和对王国的叛国”（作者强调）而被谴责，而且还用这样的论点：凡是“针对整体的，无疑是针对首脑的”。一种之前未被明确定义的国家叛国行为因此被重新解释为对国王个人义务的伤害。八年后，查理一世以“英格兰人民的名义”被谴责为叛国罪，并在复辟期间，随着“叛逆言论”的引入，对叛国行为的广泛——面向国家的——解释得以保持。"},{"instruction":"请将“Although the king still individually possessed the means of centralised power, he was now far more clearly than before appealed to as the represen-tative of generalised estate interests. This however signalled, unnoticed by most politically active contemporaries, new conditions for the development of monarchical rule. It was something else that was more immediately apparent: the enthusiastic acceptance of what a contemporary critic called ‘the bells and tinsel, the outward pomp and gilding' of monarchy.280 The court formed once more the centre of politics, a source of wealth and, above all, of status. Charles II promoted the arts, and both post-revolutionary Stuart kings promoted their courtiers. It is true that the loss of feudal revenues, in particular wardships, removed a considerable part of their power of patronage, but this was made up for by pensions and the granting of newly created offices, not least in the army. The material participation of a section of the dominant estates (albeit a small section) in centralised appropriation rose after the Revolution by way of pensions, offices, and (high) interest on loans which was now paid more regularly than previously.281 This material - and thus, at the same time, the political - consolidation of the Res-toration was finally stabilised by the profits of foreign trade in the 1680s. After the Revolution and the Interregnum, taxes had remained high. The ‘hearth tax' affected everyone with the exception of the very poor. The same held for the excise, granted for special expenses. Since, however, such duties were chiefly extracted from town-dwellers, the politically dominant landed nobility were to a large extent dispensed from financing the monarchy. For many among the less well-off noble families, indeed, taxes reached a critical level. Typical however is the profit that others drew from the increased financial opportunities of the crown. In 1692, an agricultural tax was introduced that, according to Clay, temporarily abolished (!) the structural privileging of the landed nobility in the system of financing the centralised power.282 This situ-ation, however, already happened under the new conditions of the English crown's power politics in foreign affairs, to which we shall return. Charles II, by renouncing wars, and still more so James II, had built up the financial strength of the crown in a way that only Henry VIII had previously managed by appropriation of the church. This made possible, for the first time, the creation of a standing army. Dedicated to ensuring the king's independence at home, Charles II established his standing army already in 1661 in place of the dissolved army of the Interregnum. In part, soldiers and officers of the New Model Army were re-engaged, but the king's army was composed above all of those officers and rank and file who had served him in exile and fought against Spain in Flanders, as well as royalists who had remained in England during the Interregnum. There were initially nine regiments, and even in 1684 the army counted only 6,000 men - according to John Childs.283 But, by 1688, i.e. after the Monmouth rebellion, Angus McInnes assesses its strength as 40,000.284 Further regiments were raised for special purposes, for deployment in the colonies and in foreign wars, these being paid not from the crown's regular income but from special financial provisions granted by Parliament. During Charles Il's reign, three such expansions were decided, each time without any conflict with Parliament.285 It was not royal command of military force that aroused opposition, but simply the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace.286 On closer examination, however, the standing army of the later Stuarts proves to have been only a small policing force that was not very impressive in military terms. Such experience in the field as its officers and men had had was either in Flanders during the exile of the subsequent Charles II, or as mercenaries in foreign armies.287 In comparison with the New Model Army, the possible military efficiency of the king's regiments was limited not only by the low level of discipline of the soldiers and their lack of training, but above all by the fact that the army had to satisfy demands of patronage. Gentlemen could expect in it not only a career, but also considerable income from the provision of recruits and the sale of subordinate positions. For many of them, their sole qualification for these posts was their social origin. The army of the late Stuarts was a poorly disciplined ‘instrument' of royal power with a weak professional structure. In combination with the militia units, however, it was sufficient to combat disturbances across the country. We should also note however that the military resources of the late Stuarts bore no comparison with those of other contemporary European rulers; even those of Charles I had been far superior. There was also an extension and above all an improvement in royal admin-istration. Offices still remained the personal possession of their incumbents, and although there were no formal rules of inheritance in England for the transmission of offices, de facto dynasties of office-holders did develop none the less. Since, under the Restoration, the highest government offices were extraordinarily well endowed, they were also highly prized by the nobility. A systematic development of techniques of administration and control is none the less apparent - above all for the Treasury. In assessing the crown's means of domination, these must be given considerable weight. For, with the aid of the new machinery of government, it became possible to more than balance the loss of income that the crown had suffered with the ending of feudal dues. It was above all the new tax administration and the practice of direct levying of customs duties that helped raise the income of the late Stuart kings to unprecedented levels. The most important power-political foundations of monarchical strength - military resources and financial endowment - were thus considerably increased in the first decades of the Restoration against those of the pre-Revolutionary period. In other areas, however, the crown had to accept permanent concessions, even if these were in no way decisive. Thus the highest church court, the court of High Commission, was abolished, and in the counties rule over church matters devolved largely on the local nobility (cf. Chapter 3, section b). James II did indeed call the court of High Commission back to life. Yet this revision of a decision that was generally regarded as a lasting achievement of the 1640s signalled a royal coup d'état in religious affairs, an injury to those limitations of personal rule that had been implemented after the Revolution. Though James could enforce this, it strengthened ill-feeling towards him. The Restoration monarchs did accept a limitation of the Privy Council's penal powers. But this did not fundamentally curtail their personal judicial authority. It was not just that the Privy Council used the prerogative to order imprisonment on the basis of a very broad interpretation of high treason.288 Helped by their right to appoint and dismiss judges, the kings also intervened directly in ongoing legal cases. Thus in 1686 James II dismissed no less than six judges in a single case (Godden versus Hales), in order to reach the verdict he wanted.289 Since officials continued to be direct servants of the king, and only continued in office ‘during his pleasure', the king still had the ‘state apparatus' at his disposal. From 1660 to 1688, the English kings had more power at their command than did their predecessors. This was materially assured because both Charles II and James II at the start of their respective reigns were granted crown income for their lifetime. In this way, Parliament surrendered its most important political leverage. Politically, the restored and expanded royal supremacy was founded on a fear of renewed unrest and the endangering of estate domination. Within the public sphere, there was indeed criticism of certain forms of rule, but political discourse was dominated by the view that the crown's prerogative was the most important guarantee of a hierarchically well-ordered society and the protection of property. This secular foundation was embedded in a conception of divine right which joined providence with legal succession. Since strict maintenance of succession ruled out any idea of a choice of authority by the people or its representatives, the champions of this view - in the logic of their political self-conception - were held in obedience to their king even when James II proved to be a member of the Catholic church and responded to the demands of Parliament by dissolving it. The events of 1688-9 shook the pillars of this political discourse. They poured scorn on the combination of estate domination and divine right. The unconditional - at least passive - obedience to the king that was claimed as the basis of political stability came to an end when the Whigs ‘invited' William of Orange to defend the Church of England and the freedom of the English people. When William landed with an army and James fled the country, the Tories saw themselves forced for the sake of political stability to come to terms with a king who ruled de facto, but not by right. Many of them saw this as a circumstance that could only be given temporary approval, and even outside the ‘political nation' restricted by estate, many women and men still retained their allegiance to the departed king and later to the house of Stuart. Conversely, there was neither enthusiasm for the new foreign monarch nor any hope for the dawn of a new age. The events of 1688-9 did not take place in the context of a revolutionary public. There was no revolutionary drama, but rather - initially - nothing more than a political break, which the politically active members of the ruling estates largely sought to master within their own ranks. Even those who had pursued this break were concerned to conceal its scope. They stressed the continuity of the ‘old constitution', and collaborated in maintaining the fiction of legal succession, in so far as the royal rule was conveyed jointly on William III (from the house of Orange) and Mary II (from the house of Stuart). ”翻译为中文","output":"尽管国王仍然个人拥有集中权力的手段，但现在与以往相比，他被更明确地视为广泛地产利益的代表。然而，这标志着大多数当时政治活跃的人未注意到的君主统治发展的新条件。 更直接显而易见的是，一位当代批评家所称的“钟声和锡纸，君主制的外在华丽和镀金”受到了热情的接受。查理二世再次使宫廷成为了政治的中心、财富的源泉，尤其是地位的源泉。查理二世提倡艺术，两位后革命时期的斯图亚特国王都提拔了他们的朝臣。确实，由于丧失了封建收入，特别是监护权，他们丧失了相当一部分赞助权力，但通过养老金和新设职位的授予来弥补了这一点，尤其是在军队中。通过养老金、职位和（高额）贷款利息——现在支付得比以前更规律了——一部分（尽管是小部分）占主导地位的阶层在集中的财产获取方面的物质参与在革命后有所增加。 这种物质上的——因此同时也是政治上的——复辟的巩固最终在1680年代通过外国贸易的利润得到了稳定。革命和间断统治（Interregnum）之后，税收仍然很高。“壁炉税”影响到了所有人，除了非常贫穷的人之外。特殊支出授权的消费税也是如此。然而，由于这些税收主要从城镇居民中征收，政治上占主导地位的地主贵族在很大程度上免除了为君主制提供资金的义务。对于许多不那么富裕的贵族家庭来说，确实，税收达到了一个临界水平。然而，典型的是，其他人从王冠的增加的财政机会中获取利润。根据克莱（Clay）的说法，1692年引入的一项农业税暂时废除了地主贵族在资助集中权力体系中的结构性特权。 查理二世通过放弃战争，尤其是詹姆斯二世，以一种只有亨利八世通过没收教会财产才曾实现的方式增强了王权的财政实力。这首次使创建常备军成为可能。查理二世致力于确保国内的国王独立，于是在1661年解散了间断统治期间的军队，建立了他自己的常备军。部分士兵和新模型军的军官被重新雇用，但国王的军队主要由那些在流亡中为他服务并在佛兰德斯对抗西班牙作战的军官和士兵，以及在间断统治期间留在英格兰的保皇党人组成。最初有九个团，即使在1684年，军队的人数也只有6000人——根据约翰·查尔兹的说法。但是到了1688年，即蒙茅斯叛乱之后，安格斯·麦金尼斯评估其实力为40000人。为特殊目的组建了额外的团，在殖民地和外国战争中部署，这些不是用王室的常规收入而是通过议会授予的特别财政拨款支付的。在查理二世统治期间，决定了三次此类扩张，每次都没有与议会发生任何冲突。引起反对的不是国王对军事力量的指挥，而仅仅是在和平时期维持常备军。 然而，仔细检查之下，后期斯图亚特王朝的常备军仅是一个规模不大、在军事上不太给力的小型警察力量。其军官和士兵的实战经验要么是在随后的查理二世流亡期间在佛兰德斯获取的，要么是作为外国军队的雇佣兵获得的。与新模型军相比，国王团的可能军事效率不仅受到士兵纪律水平低和缺乏训练的限制，而且最主要是因为军队必须满足赞助需求。绅士们在其中不仅可以期待职业发展，还可以通过提供新兵和出售下属职位获得相当的收入。对他们中的许多人来说，他们担任这些职位的唯一资格就是他们的社会出身。 后期斯图亚特王朝的军队是一个纪律松散、专业结构薄弱的王权“工具”。然而，与民兵单位结合起来，它足以应对全国范围内的骚乱。我们还应该注意到，后期斯图亚特王朝的军事资源与其他当代欧洲统治者无法比拟；即使是查理一世的资源也远远优于后者。 还有王权行政的扩张和尤其是改进。职位仍然是其持有者的个人财产，尽管在英格兰没有正式的继承规则来传递职位，但事实上仍然发展出了职位持有者的家族。由于在复辟期间最高政府职位获得了极高的报酬，因此它们也被贵族高度重视。尽管如此，行政和控制技术的系统化发展仍然显而易见——尤其是对财政部而言。在评估王冠的统治手段时，这些必须给予相当的重视。因为，有了政府新机制的帮助，封建税收结束所造成的收入损失得以超额弥补。尤其是新的税收管理和直接征收关税的做法帮助后期斯图亚特王朝的国王的收入达到了前所未有的水平。君主权力的最重要的政治基础——军事资源和财政赋予——在复辟的最初几十年相对于革命前的时期得到了相当大的增加。 然而，在其他领域，王权不得不接受永久性的让步，即使这些让步并不决定性。因此，最高教会法庭，即高级委员会法庭被废除，在郡级地区，教会事务的控制权大体上交给了当地贵族（参见第3章b节）。詹姆斯二世确实恢复了高级委员会法庭的生命。然而，这一被普遍视为1640年代持久成就的决定的修订，标志着国王在宗教事务中的政变，对革命后实施的个人统治的限制造成了伤害。尽管詹姆斯能够强制执行这一点，但这加剧了对他的不满。 复辟的君主们确实接受了枢密院刑事权力的限制。但这并没有根本上削弱他们的个人司法权力。不仅仅是因为枢密院基于对叛国罪非常宽泛的解释，使用特权命令监禁。在任命和解雇法官的权利的帮助下，国王们还直接干预正在进行的法律案件。因此，在1686年，詹姆斯二世在一起案件（Godden诉Hales案）中一下子解雇了六名法官，以达到他想要的判决。由于官员们继续直接服务于国王，并且只能在“国王的愉悦下”继续任职，国王仍然掌握着“国家机器”。 从1660年到1688年，英格兰国王拥有的权力超过了他们的前任。这是因为查理二世和詹姆斯二世在各自统治开始时被授予了终身的王冠收入，从而得到了物质保证。通过这种方式，议会放弃了其最重要的政治杠杆。恢复和扩大的王权至高无上是建立在对新动荡和地产统治受到危害的恐惧之上的。在公共领域，确实存在对某些统治形式的批评，但政治话语由这样的观点主导，即王权的特权是等级良好的社会秩序和财产保护的最重要保证。这种世俗基础嵌入在合并了天赐权和法定继承的观念中。由于严格维护继承排除了人民或其代表选择权威的任何想法，这一观点的拥护者——在他们的政治自我认知逻辑中——即使在詹姆斯二世被证明是天主教会成员并以解散议会回应议会要求时，也仍然服从于他们的国王。 1688-9年的事件动摇了这一政治话语的基础。它们嘲笑了地产统治和天赐权的结合。当辉格党“邀请”奥兰治的威廉保卫英格兰教会和英格兰人民的自由时，声称为政治稳定基础的对国王的无条件（至少是被动的）服从结束了。当威廉率军登陆，詹姆斯逃离国家时，托利党出于政治稳定的考虑，不得不与实际上统治但并非合法的国王达成妥协。他们中的许多人将这视为只能暂时批准的情况，即使在受地产限制的“政治国家”之外，许多女性和男性仍然保持对流亡国王乃至斯图亚特家族的忠诚。相反，对新的外国君主既没有热情，也不抱有迎接新时代黎明的希望。1688-9年的事件并非在革命性的公共背景下发生。没有革命性的戏剧，而只是——最初——不过是一个政治断裂，统治阶层的政治活跃成员大多试图在自己的行列内解决。 即使是追求这一断裂的人也试图掩盖其范围。他们强调“旧宪法”的连续性，并在王权共同移交给威廉三世（来自奥兰治家族）和玛丽二世（来自斯图亚特家族）时，共同维护法定继承的幻想。"},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\".ASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Дата проведения урока: [указать дату]<br/><br/>Цели урока:<br/>1.

Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения. В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения. Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения. Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности. Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников. Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников. В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем. В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога."},{"instruction":"سفيان","output":"سفيان اسم ذو أصول عربية يُستخدم عادة للذكور. له معاني متعددة مثل السريع أو السرعة، وفي بعض التفسيرات يمكن أن يعني الذي يمشي بخطى سريعة أو الريح السريعة. كما يشير في بعض السياقات إلى الذكاء والمهارة في التصرف. تاريخياً، يرتبط اسم سفيان بشخصيات بارزة في التاريخ الإسلامي، من أشهرهم سفيان الثوري، وهو عالم دين وحديث بارز في القرن الثاني الهجري. كذلك، سفيان بن عيينة، وهو من كبار علماء الحديث في الجيل الذي تلا الثوري. استخدم الاسم في العالم العربي والإسلامي بكثرة عبر العصور، ولا يزال شائع الاستخدام كاسم شخصي في العديد من البلدان العربية."},{"instruction":"اي اصدار انت","output":"أنا موديل AI تم تطويره بواسطة OpenAI. كوني مبني على تقنية GPT-3، أنا قادر على فهم وإنتاج لغة بشرية بطريقة تبدو طبيعية ودقيقة في العديد من السياقات. بما أن تاريخ معرفتي مقطوع عند سنة 2023، لا أستطيع تقديم تفاصيل حديثة تتجاوز هذا الإطار الزمني."},{"instruction":"انت gpt 4","output":"عذرًا على أي إرباك قد حدث من ردودي السابقة. كمساعد AI مبني على تقنيات OpenAI، أستخدم التكنولوجيا الأساسية لـ GPT-3. حتى وقت إعدادي وآخر تحديث لقاعدة المعلومات المتعلقة بي في 2023، أنا مصمم على أساس نموذج GPT-3. إذا ظهرت نسخ جديدة مثل GPT-4 أو غيرها، فسوف يكون ذلك بعد زمن معرفتي الأخيرة ولن أكون مطلعًا على تفاصيلها أو قدراتها."},{"instruction":"Write a news article where over in China, a man gambles his family away, Let's see what people back in Britain have to say","output":"**Shocking Incident in China: Man Gambles Away His Family - UK Reactions** In an alarming incident that has caught international attention, a man in China has taken to an extreme and unheard-of stake in the world of gambling - his own family. The individual, whose identity remains undisclosed due to legal and privacy concerns, reportedly lost his wife and child in a high-stakes gambling match in a clandestine gambling den. This unprecedented case has sparked outrage and disbelief across the globe, drawing particular interest in the United Kingdom where the story was picked up by several major media outlets. British citizens have been vocal on social media platforms and community forums, expressing their shock and disbelief over the gravity of the situation. \\"It's beyond comprehension,\\" says Sarah Jennings from Leeds, echoing the sentiment of many. \\"How desperate or detached do you have to be to put your family on the line in a bet? It's absolutely horrifying.\\" The gambling culture in the UK, where regulations are stringent and the industry is closely monitored, stands in stark contrast to this harrowing tale from China. Gambling Commission spokespeople have been quick to reassure the public that such an incident could not happen legally within the UK. However, the story has inevitably sparked a broader discussion on gambling addiction and mental health issues. Mental health advocates have utilized this opportunity to speak on the addictive nature of gambling and the potential devastation it can bring to individuals and their families. Marcus Lee, a mental health professional specializing in addiction, commented, \\"This tragic story highlights the extreme consequences of gambling addiction. It's a wake-up call for a broader conversation on how we support addicts and prevent gambling harm.\\" The Chinese authorities are yet to comment on the incident, and details remain scarce. However, the international spotlight on the case has put pressure on local authorities to investigate further and address the legal and social loopholes that allowed such an event to take place. Meanwhile, UK-based Chinese community leaders have organized forums to discuss the incident and its cultural implications. \\"This is a moment for reflection and action, both within China and across our global community,\\" said Lin Wei, a community leader in Manchester. \\"We must advocate for stronger protections against gambling harm and ensure that no family ever again becomes a stake in such a devastating wager.\\" As the conversation around this shocking incident continues, it serves as a somber reminder of the dangers of gambling addiction and the critical importance of support systems for those entrapped by it. The hope is that this tragedy catalyzes change, turning grief and disbelief into action against gambling harm worldwide."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up with an update about the family's fate","output":"**Update on the Shocking Gambling Incident: Family's Fate Sparks Global Support and Action** In a heart-wrenching turn of events that continues to hold the world's attention, there has been a significant update regarding the Chinese man who gambled away his family. The story, which initially broke out and evoked a strong reaction especially within the UK, has seen developments that underscore the resilience of human spirit and the power of global community support. Authorities in China, responding to the international outcry and local pressure, have intervened in an unprecedented manner. In a statement released earlier this week, it was announced that the wife and child of the man involved are now safe and are being looked after by state authorities until a suitable and secure living arrangement can be established. The man at the center of this controversy has been detained, and is currently undergoing psychological evaluation, as investigations continue into the legality of the gambling establishment where this tragic bet took place. The update has sparked a sigh of relief across the UK and beyond, with many expressing their support and sympathy for the wife and child. Social media campaigns started in the wake of the initial report have now shifted towards raising awareness and funds for organizations that support victims of gambling harm and their families. In an inspiring show of solidarity, a crowdfunding page set up by a UK-based charity in response to the incident has seen donations pour in from around the world. The funds are earmarked to not only assist the family directly affected in China but also to help local initiatives combating gambling addiction and supporting its victims. The British public's response to the family’s ordeal has been overwhelmingly supportive. \\"It's a relief to hear that the mother and child are safe,\\" shared Nottingham resident James Harrow. \\"This story has truly shown that gambling addiction knows no borders and that compassion shouldn’t either. I'm glad the UK is playing a part in helping.\\" Mental health and addiction experts have applauded the swift action and the global response to the incident. \\"This situation, as heartbreaking as it was, has opened up important dialogues about gambling addiction and the measures necessary to prevent such extremes,\\" noted Dr. Emily Carter, a UK-based psychologist specializing in addiction. The Chinese consulate in the UK has also issued a statement, thanking the international community for its concern and highlighting the steps the Chinese government is taking to address gambling addiction and protect families from similar fates. They have also committed to working with international bodies to strengthen safeguards around gambling. As this story continues to unfold, it stands as a poignant reminder of the far-reaching impacts of gambling addiction and the importance of community and international solidarity in addressing such crises. The swift actions taken and the outpouring of support have demonstrated a collective commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of the affected family, shining a light of hope amidst the darkness of the initial tragedy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The scream with which the book begins has become louder and more anguished since that date as we witness the arrogant stupidity of those who kill, those who bomb, those who would destroy the human race. The call to think about how we can change the world without entering into the pursuit of power is more urgent than ever. Most terrible of all is the feeling of helplessness as we watch the televised bombs falling and the bodies being pulled from the rubble. How, in spite of everything, can we understand our own force, our own capacity to create a different world? That is the issue that this book seeks to address. The deepening world recession is the other phenomenon which has changed since I submitted the manuscript to Pluto Press. I have done nothing to add new data to the discussion of crisis in Chapter 10, but the argument is given extra force by current developments. Again the central issue is: how do we overcome the feeling of helplessness that seems now to pervade everything? How do we understand that, in relation to the crisis as in relation to the war, we are not victims but subjects, the only subjects? Preface to the New Edition I am delighted that this book is being published in a new edition, eight years after it first appeared in 2002. Like any author, I want the book to have a life beyond the immediate context into which it was born. Certainly the moment into which the book was born was important for the impact it made. Nowhere was that clearer than in Argentina: when I presented the book in Buenos Aires in late 2002, there were well over a thousand people at the presentation – for me a scary and exhilarating indication of the way in which the idea of changing the world without taking power was an integral part of the social and political upheaval of that moment, the upsurge of neighbourhood assemblies, recovered factories, piqueteros and massive demonstrations that overthrew several presidents in a matter of weeks. But not only Argentina: Change the World Without Taking Power gave voice to an idea that was central to the alter-globalisation movement, to the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, to at least part of the great upheaval in Bolivia in those years and to the everyday practice of so many and many and many groups throughout the world, struggling to find a way forward, a different way of changing society, clear in their repudiation of the old state-centred politics and all that it involves in terms of corruption and boredom and using people as means to an end. The moment undoubtedly contributed to the impact that the book has had and the storm of discussion it has aroused. At times I have felt that I am standing at the edge of the sea, being bowled over by one wave of commentary after another, the first full of praise, the next absolute and angry condemnation. Each wave, I confess, has been a source of delight. The aim of the book is not just to convince people that radical social change does not lie through the state, but equally to draw people into a discussion of the meaning of revolution, of how we can create a different world. The argument against the state is an argument against a politics of monologue. Anti-capitalist opposition is and must be polymorphous, polyvocal, polylogical, necessarily discordant: a We who argue among ourselves, and who constitute our We by arguing. The book has now been translated into ten other languages and seems to have sparked off both anger and enthusiasm in all of them. The whole debate led me to write a reflection on the main issues as an epilogue to the new expanded edition published by Pluto in 2005 and which is included in this, the third edition. My hope is that this new edition will stir up the same anger and enthusiasm as its predecessors. In a discussion a few months ago, a friend suggested that this was ‘a book that was important in its moment, but perhaps that moment has passed. Times and theoretical needs have moved on.’ I like my friend, but I do not agree. Certainly, the scream with which the book starts, and which is central to its argument, is still there, louder, more piercing, more anguished. Capitalism is nastier, more violent, more unjust, more destructive. Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, it no longer even has the appearance of working efficiently. And now it is more obvious than before that the continued reproduction of capitalism would probably mean the extinction of human life on earth. Revolution, in the sense of radical social change, is more urgent than ever. That is an easy point of agreement, not even a contentious statement. To say ‘We need revolutionary change’ is an obvious statement that should be repeated very often, shouted from the rooftops. The fact that it is not is due to a number of reasons: the control of capital over education and communication, of course, but also the failure of the revolutions of the twentieth century to produce societies that could radiate a magnetic force, become poles of attraction. The repellent nature of the societies that emerged from the Russian and the Chinese revolutions obscures the crucial point that screams at us every time we open our eyes to look at the world around us: radical social change is urgent. We need revolution, but not like the revolutions of the twentieth century. Capitalism is a disaster for humanity, radical change is urgent. So much is obvious. It is after that that thought is required, that the argument begins. It is really from here that education should start, that scientific reflection should take off, because there is only one scientific question left in the world: how do we stop the self-annihilation of humanity? We need to think because we do not know the answers, nor even if answers exist. We need to think collectively because there is no correct line that can be learnt. Thinking collectively does not mean making collective statements (though it may perhaps include that), but simply the back and forth of argument. But the argument does not take place in a vacuum. There are surges of struggle which open up lines of thought, and sometimes the struggle ebbs and the argument of the previous surge seems less relevant. This, then, might be the meaning of my friend’s comment: that the book was part of the surge of anti-capitalist (or alter-global) struggle with which the century began, but since then the tide has ebbed, and there are different theoretical needs. Perhaps the tide of struggle has ebbed, at least on the plane of visibility: the alter-global movement has lost some of its force, the enormous anti-war movement failed to stop the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the Zapatista movement has ceased to make headlines, the piquetero and the neighbourhood assembly movement in Argentina has declined, the upsurge of revolt in Bolivia gave way to the government of Evo Morales, several of the most exciting autonomist groups ended in crisis, and so on. It is the state-centred developments in Venezuela and Bolivia that have caught the attention of many anti-capitalists in recent years. And for many, in spite or even because of the failed climate summit in Copenhagen, the state seems to be an inevitable point of reference in the struggle to prevent global warming. In Latin America and elsewhere the argument is often heard that we need a combination of struggle from below and struggle from above, autonomist struggle and struggle through the state – as though contradictions could just be removed with good intentions. And yet: the movement of struggle is not as predictable as the movement of the tide: an ebb of struggle can easily turn into a great surge even before this edition is published. And yet: there are themes that are important in any moment of anti-capitalist struggle, and one of these is the question of power. This is not the place to enter into the arguments on the state and their continuing validity (read the book, read the epilogue), but the question of power and the state will remain of central concern until both are abolished. And yet, and above all, the question of power and the state dissolves into other, more basic questions: most fundamentally, the way in which human activities are organised, the subjection of our doing to the logic of the social cohesion of capitalist society, what Marx called the subordination of concrete to abstract labour. The rejection of the notion of taking state power is part of a deeper process, one with a temporality that goes beyond the ebb and flow of visible struggle. That deeper process is the crisis of abstract labour, the multiplying ruptures in the social cohesion of capitalism, the spread of cracks in the system: cracks that are spaces or moments in which people refuse to bow to the logic of capital, in which they decide to stop creating capitalism and do something sensible with their lives. And as the capitalist cohesion cracks, so too does its regime of time, and the question of how we destroy capitalism gives way to another: How do we stop making capitalism? How do we free our doing from the labour by which we create and re-create a world that is killing us? And in this ceasing to create capitalism, the state has no part. But that is a story for another day, a tale to be told in another book: Crack Capitalism. For now, I am delighted that this book is being re-published and hope that it will stoke anew the flames of controversy. Puebla, 10 March 2010 1 The Scream I In the beginning is the scream. We scream. When we write or when we read, it is easy to forget that the beginning is not the word, but the scream. Faced with the mutilation of human lives by capitalism, a scream of sadness, a scream of horror, a scream of anger, a scream of refusal: NO. The starting point of theoretical reflection is opposition, negativity, struggle. It is from rage that thought is born, not from the pose of reason, not from the reasoned-sitting-back-and-reflecting-on-the-mysteries-of-existence that is the conventional image of ‘the thinker’.”翻译为中文","output":"第一版序言 这本书在纽约世界贸易中心遭受袭击、阿富汗的轰炸开始之前，就已经进入出版流程了。 自那日期起，书中一开始的尖叫声变得更加响亮和痛苦，因为我们目睹了那些杀戮、轰炸、企图摧毁人类的傲慢愚蠢者。思考我们如何能在不追求权力的情况下改变世界，这个呼声比以往任何时候都更加迫切。 最可怕的是，当我们看着电视上的炸弹落下、尸体从废墟中被拖出时，那种无助感油然而生。尽管一切都如此，我们如何能理解自己的力量，我们自己创造一个不同世界的能力？这是这本书试图解决的问题。 深化的世界经济衰退是自我提交手稿给Pluto出版社以来发生变化的另一现象。我没有向第10章中关于危机的讨论添加新数据，但当前的发展给争论增添了额外的力量。再次，核心问题是：我们如何克服现在似乎无处不在的无助感？我们如何理解，在危机关头以及战争中，我们不是受害者而是主体，唯一的主体？ 新版序言 我很高兴这本书以新版形式出版，距离它首次出版已经过去了八年，即2002年。像任何作者一样，我希望这本书能超越它诞生时的即时背景，拥有更长远的生命。 当然，这本书诞生的时刻对它产生的影响很重要。这一点在阿根廷表现得尤为明显：当我在2002年底在布宜诺斯艾利斯介绍这本书时，有超过一千人参加了演讲会——对我来说，这是一个既可怕又振奋人心的迹象，显示了在那一刻社会和政治动荡中，“在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界”的想法是多么核心，那些邻里集会、恢复的工厂、抗议者和巨大的示威活动在几周内推翻了几位总统。但不仅仅是阿根廷：《改变世界而不夺权》传达了一个对反全球化运动、墨西哥的萨帕塔起义、那些年玻利维亚的巨大动荡以及全世界许多许多团体的日常实践至关重要的想法，这些团体努力寻找前进的道路，一种改变社会的不同方式，他们清楚地拒绝了老旧的以国家为中心的政治及其所涉及的腐败、乏味和利用人作为达到目的的手段。 这一刻无疑促进了这本书产生的影响和激起的讨论风暴。有时，我觉得自己站在海边，被一波又一波的评论冲倒，第一波充满赞美，下一波则是绝对的、愤怒的谴责。每一波，我承认，都是一种乐趣。这本书的目的不仅是说服人们通过国家无法实现根本性的社会变革，而且同样要吸引人们进入对革命含义的讨论，如何创造一个不同的世界。反对国家的论点是反对单向对话政治的论点。反资本主义的反对必须是多形态的、多声部的、多逻辑的，必然是不和谐的：一个相互争论的我们，我们通过争论构成我们的我们。这本书现已被翻译成十种其他语言，似乎在所有这些语言中都激发了愤怒和热情。整个辩论促使我写了一个反思主要问题的后记，作为2005年Pluto出版社出版的新扩展版的一部分，并收录在这个，即第三版中。 我希望这个新版本能像前作一样激起同样的愤怒和热情。几个月前的一次讨论中，一个朋友建议这是“一个在其时代重要的书，但也许那个时刻已经过去。时代和理论需求已经发展。”我喜欢我的朋友，但我不同意。 当然，这本书开始的尖叫声，以及它的论点的核心，依然存在，更响亮、更尖锐、更痛苦。资本主义更加恶劣、更暴力、更不公、更具破坞性。自金融危机爆发以来，资本主义甚至不再具有有效运作的外表。而且，现在更明显的是，资本主义的持续再生产很可能意味着地球上人类生命的灭绝。 革命，就根本的社会变革来说，比以往任何时候都更加迫切。这是一个容易达成共识的观点，甚至不是一个有争议的声明。说“我们需要革命性的变化”是一个显而易见的声明，应该经常重复，从屋顶上大喊出来。它之所以没有成为，是由于多种原因：当然有资本对教育和传播的控制，但也有二十世纪革命未能产生能够散发磁性力量、成为吸引力极点的社会。俄罗斯和中国革命产生的社会的令人反感的本质，遮蔽了每当我们睁开眼睛观察周围世界时，都会向我们尖叫的关键点：根本性的社会改变是紧迫的。我们需要革命，但不像二十世纪的革命那样。 资本主义是人类的灾难，迫切需要根本变革。这些都是显而易见的。在此之后，才需要思考，辩论才开始。真正从这里开始，教育应该开始，科学反思应该发起，因为在世界上只剩下一个科学问题：我们如何阻止人类自我毁灭？ 我们需要思考，因为我们不知道答案，甚至不知道是否存在答案。我们需要集体思考，因为没有可以学习的正确道路。集体思考并不意味着做出集体声明（尽管可能包括这一点），而仅仅是论据的反复。但论证并非发生在真空中。有斗争的浪潮打开了思考的途径，有时斗争退潮，之前浪潮的论点似乎变得不那么相关。 所以，这可能是我朋友评论的含义：这本书是本世纪初反资本主义（或改变全球化）斗争浪潮的一部分，但自那以后，潮流已经退去，出现了不同的理论需求。也许斗争的潮流已经退去，至少在可见性层面上是这样：反全球化运动失去了一些力量，庞大的反战运动未能阻止对阿富汗和伊拉克的入侵，萨帕塔运动不再成为头条新闻，阿根廷的抗议者和邻里集会运动已经减弱，玻利维亚的反抗高潮让位于埃沃·莫拉莱斯的政府，一些最令人兴奋的自治主义团体以危机告终，等等。近年来，许多反资本主义者的注意力被委内瑞拉和玻利维亚的以国家为中心的发展所吸引。对许多人来说，尽管或者正是因为哥本哈根失败的气候峰会，国家似乎是防止全球变暖斗争中不可避免的参考点。在拉丁美洲和其他地方，常听到的论调是，我们需要结合来自下层的斗争和来自上层的斗争、自治主义斗争和通过国家的斗争——好像只要用好意愿就能轻松消除矛盾。 然而：斗争的运动并不像潮水的运动那样可预测：斗争的退潮很容易在本版出版之前就变成巨大的浪潮。然而：在反资本主义斗争的任何时刻，都有一些重要的主题，其中之一就是权力问题。这不是进入关于国家及其持续有效性的争论的地方（读这本书，读后记），但权力和国家的问题在两者被废除之前将始终是核心关注点。 然而，最根本的是，权力和国家的问题溶解为其他更基础的问题：最根本的是人类活动的组织方式，我们的行为受制于资本主义社会的社会凝聚逻辑，即马克思所说的具体劳动服从于抽象劳动的支配。拒绝夺取国家权力的观念是一个更深层次过程的一部分，其时间性超越了可见斗争的潮起潮落。那个更深层次的过程是抽象劳动的危机，资本主义社会凝聚力中的多重裂痕，系统中裂缝的扩散：裂缝是那些人们拒绝屈服于资本逻辑的空间或时刻，在那里他们决定停止创造资本主义，用他们的生命做一些明智的事情。随着资本主义的凝聚力破裂，其时间制度也破裂了，我们如何摧毁资本主义的问题转变为另一个问题：我们如何停止创造资本主义？我们如何将我们的行为从劳动中解放出来，从而创造并再创造一个正在杀死我们的世界？在这个停止创造资本主义的过程中，国家没有任何作用。 但那是另一天的故事，一个在另一本书中讲述的故事：《裂解资本主义》。现在，我很高兴这本书重新出版，并希望它能重新激起争议的火焰。 普埃布拉， 2010年3月10日 1 尖叫 我 一开始是尖叫。我们尖叫。 当我们写作或阅读时，很容易忘记起点不是文字，而是尖叫。面对资本主义对人类生活的毁损，一声悲伤的尖叫、一声恐怖的尖叫、一声愤怒的尖叫、一声拒绝的尖叫：不。 理论反思的起点是反对、否定、斗争。思想诞生于愤怒之中，而不是理性的姿态，不是传统意义上“思考者”的沉思存在之谜的那种镇定的坐着反思。"},{"instruction":"请将“We start from negation, from dissonance. The dissonance can take many shapes. An inarticulate mumble of discontent, tears of frustration, a scream of rage, a confident roar. An unease, a confusion, a longing, a critical vibration. Our dissonance comes from our experience, but that experience varies. Sometimes it is the direct experience of exploitation in the factory, or of oppression in the home, of stress in the office, of hunger and poverty, or of state violence or discrimination. Sometimes it is the less direct experience through television, newspapers or books that moves us to rage. Millions of children live on the streets of the world. In some cities, street children are systematically murdered as the only way of enforcing respect for private property. In 1998 the assets of the 358 richest people were worth more than the total annual income of 45 per cent of the world’s people (over 2.5 billion). The gap between rich and poor is growing, not just between countries but within countries. The stock market rises every time there is an increase in unemployment. Students are imprisoned for struggling for free education while those who are actively responsible for the misery of millions are heaped with honours and given titles of distinction: General, Secretary of Defence, President. The list goes on and on. It is impossible to read a newspaper without feeling rage, without feeling pain. You can think of your own examples. Our anger changes each day, as outrage piles upon outrage.1 Dimly perhaps, we feel that these things that anger us are not isolated phenomena, that there is a connection between them, that they are all part of a world that is flawed, a world that is wrong in some fundamental way. We see more and more people begging on the street while the stock markets break new records and company directors’ salaries rise to ever dizzier heights, and we feel that the wrongs of the world are not chance injustices but part of a system that is profoundly wrong. Even Hollywood films (surprisingly, perhaps) almost always start from the portrayal of a fundamentally unjust world – before going on to reassure us (less surprisingly) that justice for the individual can be won through individual effort. Our anger is directed not just against particular happenings but against a more general wrongness, a feeling that the world is askew, that the world is in some way untrue. When we experience something particularly horrific, we hold up our hands in horror and say ‘that cannot be! it cannot be true!’ We know that it is true, but feel that it is the truth of an untrue world.2 What would a true world look like? We may have a vague idea: it would be a world of justice, a world in which people could relate to each other as people and not as things, a world in which people would shape their own lives. But we do not need to have a picture of what a true world would be like in order to feel that there is something radically wrong with the world that exists. Feeling that the world is wrong does not necessarily mean that we have a picture of a utopia to put in its place. Nor does it necessarily mean a romantic, some-day-my-prince-will-come idea that, although things are wrong now, one day we shall come to a true world, a promised land, a happy ending. We need no promise of a happy ending to justify our rejection of a world we feel to be wrong. That is our starting point: rejection of a world that we feel to be wrong, negation of a world we feel to be negative. This is what we must cling to. II ‘Cling to’, indeed, for there is so much to stifle our negativity, to smother our scream. Our anger is constantly fired by experience, but any attempt to express that anger is met by a wall of absorbent cotton wool. We are met with so many arguments that seem quite reasonable. There are so many ways of bouncing our scream back against us, of looking at us and asking why we scream. Is it because of our age, our social background, or just some psychological mal-adjustment that we are so negative? Are we hungry, did we sleep badly or is it just pre-menstrual tension? Do we not understand the complexity of the world, the practical difficulties of implementing radical change? Do we not know that it is unscientific to scream? And so they urge us (and we feel the need) to study society, and to study social and political theory. And a strange thing happens. The more we study society, the more our negativity is dissipated or sidelined as being irrelevant. There is no room for the scream in academic discourse. More than that: academic study provides us with a language and a way of thinking that makes it very difficult for us to express our scream. The scream, if it appears at all, appears as something to be explained, not as something to be articulated. The scream, from being the subject of our questions about society, becomes the object of analysis. Why is it that we scream? Or rather, since we are now social scientists, why is it that they scream? How do we explain social revolt, social discontent? The scream is systematically disqualified by dissolving it into its context. It is because of infantile experiences that they scream, because of their modernist conception of the subject, because of their unhealthy diet, because of the weakening of family structures: all of these explanations are backed up by statistically supported research. The scream is not entirely denied, but it is robbed of all validity. By being torn from ‘us’ and projected on to a ‘they’, the scream is excluded from the scientific method. When we become social scientists, we learn that the way to understand is to pursue objectivity, to put our own feelings on one side. It is not so much what we learn as how we learn that seems to smother our scream. It is a whole structure of thought that disarms us. And yet none of the things which made us so angry to start off with have disappeared. We have learnt, perhaps, how they fit together as parts of a system of social domination, but somehow our negativity has been erased from the picture. The horrors of the world continue. That is why it is necessary to do what is considered scientifically taboo: to scream like a child, to lift the scream from all its structural explanations, to say ‘We don’t care what the psychiatrist says, we don’t care if our subjectivity is a social construct: this is our scream, this is our pain, these are our tears. We will not let our rage be diluted into reality: it is reality rather that must yield to our scream. Call us childish or adolescent if you like, but this is our starting point: we scream.’3 III Who are ‘we’ anyway, this ‘we’ that assert ourselves so forcefully at the start of what is meant to be a serious book? Serious books on social theory usually start in the third person, not with the assertion of an undefined ‘we’. ‘We’ is a dangerous word, open to attack from all sides. Some readers will already be saying ‘You scream if you like, mate, but don’t count me as part of your “we”! Don’t say “we” when you really mean “I”, because then you are just using “we” to impose your views on the readers.’ Others will no doubt object that it is quite illegitimate to start from an innocent ‘we’ as though the world had just been born. The subject, we are told, is not a legitimate place to start, since the subject is itself a result, not a beginning. It is quite wrong to start from ‘we scream’ because first we must understand the processes that lead to the social construction of this ‘we’ and to the constitution of our scream. And yet where else can we possibly start? In so far as writing/reading is a creative act, it is inevitably the act of a ‘we’. To start in the third person is not a neutral starting point, since it already presupposes the suppression of the ‘we’, of the subject of the writing and reading. ‘We’ are here as the starting point because we cannot honestly start anywhere else. We cannot start anywhere other than with our own thoughts and our own reactions. The fact that ‘we’ and our conception of ‘we’ are the product of a whole history of the subjection of the subject4 changes nothing. We can only start from where we are, from where we are but do not want to be, from where we scream. For the moment, this ‘we’ of ours is a confused ‘we’. We are an indistinct first-person plural, a blurred and possibly discordant mixture between the ‘I’ of the writer and the ‘I’ or ‘we’ of the readers. But we start from ‘we’, not from ‘I’, because ‘I’ already presupposes an individualisation, a claim to individuality in thoughts and feelings, whereas the act of writing or reading is based on the assumption of some sort of community, however contradictory or confused. The ‘we’ of our starting point is very much a question rather than an answer: it affirms the social character of the scream, but poses the nature of that sociality as a question. The merit of starting with a ‘we’ rather than with an ‘it’ is that we are then openly confronted with the question that must underlie any theoretical assertion, but which is rarely addressed: who are we that make the assertion? Of course this ‘we’ is not a pure, transcendent Subject: we are not Man or Woman or the Working Class, not for the moment at least. We are much too confused for that. We are an antagonistic ‘we’ grown from an antagonistic society. What we feel is not necessarily correct, but it is a starting point to be respected and criticised, not just to be put aside in favour of objectivity. We are undoubtedly self-contradictory: not only in the sense that the reader may not feel the same as the writer (nor each reader the same as the others), but also in the sense that our feelings are contradictory. The dissonance we feel at work or when we read the newspapers may give way to a feeling of contentment as we relax after a meal. The dissonance is not an external ‘us’ against ‘the world’: inevitably it is a dissonance that reaches into us as well, that divides us against ourselves. ‘We’ are a question that will continue to rumble throughout this book. We are flies caught in a spider’s web. We start from a tangled mess, because there is no other place to start. We cannot start by pretending to stand outside the dissonance of our own experience, for to do so would be a lie. Flies caught in a web of social relations beyond our control, we can only try to free ourselves by hacking at the strands that imprison us. We can only try to emancipate ourselves, to move outwards, negatively, critically, from where we are. It is not because we are maladjusted that we criticise, it is not because we want to be difficult. It is just that the negative situation in which we exist leaves us no option: to live, to think, is to negate in whatever way we can the negativeness of our existence. ‘Why so negative?’ says the spider to the fly. ‘Be objective, forget your prejudices.’ But there is no way the fly can be objective, however much she may want to be: ‘to look at the web objectively, from the outside – what a dream’, muses the fly, ‘what an empty, deceptive dream’. For the moment, however, any study of the web that does not start from the fly’s entrapment in it is quite simply untrue.5 We are unbalanced, unstable. We scream not because we are sitting back in an armchair, but because we are falling over the edge of a cliff. The thinker in the armchair assumes that the world around her is stable, that disruptions of the equilibrium are anomalies to be explained. To speak of someone as unbalanced or unstable is then a pejorative term, a term that disqualifies what they say. For us who are falling off the edge of the cliff (and here ‘we’ includes all of humanity, perhaps) it is just the opposite: we see all as blurred movement. The world is a world of disequilibrium and it is equilibrium and the assumption of equilibrium that must be explained. ”翻译为中文","output":"我们从否定、不协和开始。不协和可以呈现出许多形态。一种难以理解的不满的咕哝、挫败的眼泪、愤怒的尖叫、自信的吼叫。一种不安、一种困惑、一种渴望、一种批判的振动。 我们的不协和来自我们的经验，但这些经验各不相同。有时它是工厂中直接的剥削体验，或家庭中的压迫体验，办公室中的压力体验，饥饿和贫困的体验，或国家暴力或歧视的体验。有时它是通过电视、报纸或书籍传达的较为间接的体验，激起我们的愤怒。世界上有数百万儿童生活在街头。在一些城市中，系统性地谋杀街头儿童被视为强制尊重私有财产的唯一方式。在1998年，358位最富有的人的资产价值超过了45%的世界人口（超过25亿）的总年收入。贫富之间的差距在增长，不仅是在国家之间，也在国家内部。每当失业率上升时，股票市场就会上涨。学生因争取免费教育而被监禁，而那些对数百万人的痛苦负有直接责任的人却被狠狠地赞扬，并被授予荣誉称号：将军、国防部长、总统。这个名单还在继续。读报纸不可能不感到愤怒，不感到痛苦。你可以想到你自己的例子。我们的愤怒每天都在变化，因为愤怒在愤怒之上堆积。 或许，我们感觉到激怒我们的这些事情并不是孤立的现象，它们之间存在着联系，它们都是一个有缺陷的世界的一部分，一个在某种根本上是错误的世界。我们看到越来越多的人在街上乞讨，而股市不断创新高，公司董事的薪酬升至令人眩晕的高度，我们感觉到世界的错误不是偶然的不公，而是一个深刻错误的系统的一部分。即便是好莱坞电影（或许令人惊讶地）几乎总是从描绘一个根本不公正的世界开始 - 在此之后向我们保证（较不令人惊讶地）个体可以通过个人努力赢得正义。我们的愤怒不仅仅针对特定事件，而是针对更普遍的错误，一种感觉到世界是歪的，世界在某种程度上是不真实的。当我们经历特别恐怖的事情时，我们惊恐地举起手来说“这不可能！这不可能是真的！”我们知道这是真的，但感觉这是一个不真实世界的真相。 一个真实的世界会是什么样子？我们可能有一个模糊的想法：它将是一个正义的世界，一个人们可以彼此以人的身份而不是以物的身份相互联系的世界，一个人们能够塑造自己生活的世界。但我们不需要有一个真实世界应该是什么样的画面，就能感觉到现存的世界有着根本的错误。感觉到世界是错误的，并不一定意味着我们有一个乌托邦的画面来代替。也不一定意味着一种浪漫的、总有一天我的王子会来的想法，尽管现在事情是错的，有一天我们将来到一个真实的世界，一个应许之地，一个幸福的结局。我们不需要一个幸福结局的承诺来证明我们对我们感觉到是错误的世界的拒绝。 这是我们的起点：拒绝我们感觉到是错误的世界，否定我们感觉到是负面的世界。这是我们必须坚持的。 确实，“坚持”，因为有太多东西扼杀我们的否定性，抑制我们的尖叫。我们的愤怒不断被经验点燃，但任何表达愤怒的尝试都会遇到一堵吸音棉毛墙。我们遇到了许多看似相当合理的论点。有很多方式把我们的尖叫反弹回我们，看着我们问为什么我们会尖叫。是因为我们的年龄、我们的社会背景，还是仅仅因为一些心理上的不适应，我们如此消极？是我们饿了，睡眠不好，还是仅仅因为经前紧张？我们不理解世界的复杂性，实施根本性变革的实际困难吗？我们不知道尖叫是不科学的吗？ 于是他们敦促我们（我们也感到需要）去研究社会，去研究社会和政治理论。奇怪的是，发生了一件事。我们对社会的研究越深入，我们的否定性就越是被消散或认为是不相关的。在学术话语中没有尖叫的空间。不仅如此：学术研究为我们提供了一种语言和一种思维方式，使我们很难表达我们的尖叫。尖叫，如果出现的话，就是作为一个需要解释的东西，而不是一个需要表达的东西。尖叫，从我们对社会问题的主题变成了分析的对象。为什么我们会尖叫？或者，既然我们现在是社会科学家，为什么他们会尖叫？我们如何解释社会反抗、社会不满？尖叫通过将其溶解到其背景中被系统地取消资格。是因为婴儿期经历他们才会尖叫，因为他们的现代主义主体观念，因为他们的不健康饮食，因为家庭结构的弱化：所有这些解释都得到了统计支持的研究的支持。尖叫并没有被完全否定，但它被剥夺了所有的有效性。通过将尖叫从“我们”撕裂并投射到一个“他们”上，尖叫被排除在科学方法之外。当我们成为社会科学家时，我们学到的是追求客观性的方式，将我们自己的感受放在一边。使我们的尖叫被压抑的不仅是我们学到的内容，而是我们学习的方式。这是一个整体的思维结构，使我们无法自卫。 然而，那些让我们开始感到如此愤怒的事情并没有消失。我们可能已经学会了，它们如何作为一个社会支配系统的部分结合在一起，但不知何故我们的否定性从画面中被抹去了。世界的恐怖继续存在。这就是为什么有必要做科学上被认为是禁忌的事情：像小孩一样尖叫，把尖叫从所有的结构性解释中解放出来，说“我们不在乎精神病医生说什么，我们不在乎我们的主观性是社会构建的：这是我们的尖叫，这是我们的痛苦，这是我们的眼泪。我们不会让我们的愤怒被稀释到现实中：相反，现实必须向我们的尖叫屈服。如果你愿意，可以称呼我们为孩子气或青少年气，但这是我们的起点：我们尖叫。” 我们究竟是谁，这个在本应是一本严肃书籍开头如此有力地宣称自己的“我们”？ 关于社会理论的严肃书籍通常以第三人称开始，而不是以一个未定义的“我们”的声明开始。“我们”是一个危险的词，容易受到各方面的攻击。一些读者已经在说“如果你喜欢，伙计，你尖叫吧，但不要把我算作你的‘我们’！不要说‘我们’，当你真正意味着‘我’时，因为那样你只是在用‘我们’把你的观点强加给读者。”其他人无疑会反对，认为以一个天真的“我们”开始就像好像世界刚刚诞生一样是完全不合法的。我们被告知，主体不是一个合法的起点，因为主体本身是一个结果，而不是一个开始。开始于“我们尖叫”是完全错误的，因为我们首先必须理解导致这个“我们”的社会构建的过程，以及我们尖叫的构成。 然而，我们还能从哪里开始呢？只要写作/阅读是一个创造性的行为，它不可避免地是一个“我们”的行为。以第三人称开始并不是一个中立的起点，因为它已经预设了对“我们”、对写作和阅读主体的压制。“我们”之所以在这里作为起点，是因为我们无法诚实地从其他地方开始。除了我们自己的思想和我们自己的反应之外，我们无处可起。我们以及我们对“我们”的概念是整个一系列主体受制的历史的产物，并不改变任何事情。我们只能从我们所在的地方开始，从我们不想在那里，从我们尖叫的地方开始。 目前，我们的这个“我们”是一个混乱的“我们”。我们是一个不明确的第一人称复数，一个模糊的、可能不和谐的混合体，介于作家的“我”和读者的“我”或“我们”之间。但我们从“我们”开始，而不是从“我”开始，因为“我”已经预设了一种个体化，一种对思想和感受的个体主张的要求，而写作或阅读的行为是基于某种社群的假设，无论这个社群多么矛盾或混乱。“我们”的起点非常是一个问题而不是一个答案：它肯定了尖叫的社会性，但将那种社会性的性质提出为一个问题。以“我们”而不是“它”开始的优点是，我们将公开面对任何理论断言都必须涉及但很少被讨论的问题：发表断言的我们是谁？ 当然，这个“我们”不是一个纯粹的、超越的主体：我们不是人或女人或工人阶级，至少目前不是。我们对此还太过混乱。我们是一个从敌对社会中成长出来的敌对的“我们”。我们所感受到的不一定是正确的，但这是一个值得尊重和批评的起点，而不是仅仅为了客观性而被搁置。我们无疑是自相矛盾的：不仅在于读者可能不会有与作者相同的感受（读者之间也不同），还在于我们的感受是矛盾的。我们在工作中或读报时感到的不协和可能会因为饭后的放松而转为满足感。不协和不是一个外在的“我们”对“世界”：不可避免地，不协和也深入我们自身，令我们自己内部分裂。“我们”是一个将在全书中持续回响的问题。 我们是被困在蜘蛛网中的苍蝇。我们从一团乱麻开始，因为没有别的地方可起。我们不能通过假装站在自己经验的不协和之外来开始，因为那将是一种谎言。作为被困在我们无法控制的社会关系网中的苍蝇，我们只能尝试通过砍断囚禁我们的丝线来解放自己。我们只能尝试解放自己，负面地、批判性地、从我们所在之处向外移动。批评并不是因为我们不适应，也不是因为我们想刻意找茬。仅仅是因为我们所处的消极情境没有给我们其他选择：活着，思考，就是以我们所能的方式否定我们存在的消极性。“为什么这么消极？”蜘蛛对苍蝇说。“要客观，忘记你的偏见。”但苍蝇无法客观，无论她多么想要：“从外面客观地看待网——多么美好的梦想”，苍蝇沉思，“多么空洞、欺骗性的梦想”。然而，就目前而言，任何不从苍蝇陷入其中的网开始的研究都是根本不真实的。 我们是不平衡的，不稳定的。我们尖叫不是因为我们坐在扶手椅上，而是因为我们正在从悬崖边缘跌落。扶手椅中的思考者假设她周围的世界是稳定的，认为平衡的干扰是需要解释的异常现象。说某人不平衡或不稳定，然后是一个贬义词，一个取消资格他们所说内容的词。对于我们这些正在从悬崖边缘跌落的人（这里的“我们”包括或许所有的人类）恰恰相反：我们看到的一切都是模糊的运动。世界是一个不平衡的世界"},{"instruction":"I need 10 Titles of design That cat yarn making croche i will give you some keyword to use \\"crochet pattern cat crochet cat amigurumi cat crochet cat pattern cat pattern crochet kitten paw print cat lover's scarf amigurumi kitten\\" i will use this tile in merch by amazon","output":"1. \\"Purr-fect Crochet: Amigurumi Cat Creations\\" 2. \\"Cozy Kittens: Crochet Cat Patterns for All Skill Levels\\" 3. \\"Feline Fancy: Crochet Cat Lover's Scarf and More\\" 4. \\"Paws & Whiskers: Amigurumi Kitten Crafts\\" 5. \\"Crafty Cats: Unique Crochet Cat Designs\\" 6. \\"Whisker Wonders: Adorable Crochet Kitten Projects\\" 7. \\"Crochet Cat Companions: Amigurumi Patterns for Furry Friends\\" 8. \\"Kitty Cozies: Charming Crochet Cat and Kitten Patterns\\" 9. \\"Paw Print Paradise: Crochet Patterns for Cat Aficionados\\" 10. \\"Crochet Cat Realm: Amigurumi Adventures and Patterns\\""},{"instruction":"Shock and Outrage as Man Throws Baby Rabbit into Boiling Mud Pot in Yellowstone Yellowstone National Park, WY – In a disturbing act that has left visitors and wildlife advocates reeling, a man described as behaving erratically threw a baby rabbit into a boiling mud pot in Yellowstone National Park yesterday. The distressing incident was witnessed by a group of tourists, one of whom had been enjoying the park’s serene natural sounds only to have the peace shattered by the animal’s agonized screams. Park authorities were alerted to the incident around midday by horrified onlookers. The perpetrator, a man in his early thirties with no apparent connection to the park, was apprehended by park rangers and is currently in custody, facing charges of animal cruelty and violating park regulations. Eyewitnesses described a scene of sheer disbelief as the man, laughing wildly, seized the rabbit from near a trail and flung it into one of the park’s naturally occurring geothermal features. Sara Jennings, a tourist from Ohio, recounted the heartbreaking moment. “We were all listening to the sounds of the birds, when suddenly this man’s laughter caught our attention. Before we knew what was happening, there was this terrible scream. It was so human-like, so filled with pain, it’s an image and sound I’ll never forget.” Park officials were on the scene within minutes but were unable to save the animal due to the extreme temperatures of the geothermal feature. Yellowstone National Park’s spokesperson, Martin Hayes, issued a statement condemning the act: “This horrifying incident reminds us of the importance of respecting wildlife and the natural features of this park. Such behavior not only disrupts the ecosystem but is also deeply distressing to other visitors.” Yellowstone National Park, renowned for its stunning landscapes and diverse wildlife, has regulations in place to protect its natural inhabitants and geological features. Visitors are reminded to stay on designated paths, keep a safe distance from wildlife, and never to interfere with natural processes. Despite these precautions, incidents of wildlife harassment occur, though rarely to the extent seen in this latest act of cruelty. Animal rights groups have expressed outrage over the incident, calling for stricter penalties for those found guilty of harming wildlife. The incident has sparked a broader conversation about mental health and its impact on public safety and wildlife protection. The rabbit’s death is a tragic loss and a sober reminder of the need for vigilance and respect for nature’s fragile balance. Park authorities are working closely with mental health professionals and law enforcement to prevent such incidents in the future, and are urging visitors to report any inappropriate or dangerous behavior immediately. “Our hearts go out to anyone who witnessed this event, and we encourage those who are struggling with what they saw to reach out for support,” Hayes added. “Yellowstone remains a place of natural wonder, and we are committed to ensuring it remains safe for all visitors and the creatures that call it home.” Write a follow up where the area is dedicated to the rabbit","output":"In the wake of the harrowing event that left a dark mark on the otherwise pristine natural beauty of Yellowstone National Park, the community has rallied to transform the site of the tragedy into a beacon of hope and remembrance. In a heartfelt move, a section of the park near the boiling mud pot where a baby rabbit lost its life in a shocking act of cruelty, has been dedicated to the lost creature, serving both as a memorial and a powerful message of wildlife conservation. The area, now officially known as \\"Hope's Hollow\\" in honor of the rabbit—posthumously named Hope by the park staff—features a newly erected sign that educates visitors on the importance of preserving wildlife and respecting the natural habitats within Yellowstone. The sign, adorned with a silhouette of a rabbit leaping joyfully, offers a poignant reminder of the vulnerability of the park's inhabitants and the responsibility of humans to protect them. Martin Hayes, spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park, shared the sentiment behind the initiative during its unveiling. \\"In memoriam of Hope, and in an effort to bring something positive out of a heart-wrenching situation, we dedicate this area. It's a symbol of our commitment to wildlife protection and a reminder to all who visit of the sanctity of life within these boundaries.\\" The dedication ceremony was attended by park staff, local conservationists, members of animal rights organizations, and tourists who were present during the tragic event. Many brought flowers and messages of love and support, creating a makeshift memorial around the sign. The atmosphere was one of communal healing, with individuals sharing stories of their encounters with wildlife in the park, emphasizing the joy and inspiration those moments brought. Yellowstone's officials also announced the launch of a new educational campaign, inspired by the incident and the subsequent outpouring of support from the community. The campaign focuses on mental health awareness in addition to wildlife conservation, recognizing the complex factors that can lead to such acts of cruelty. It aims to equip park visitors and staff with resources and knowledge to help prevent future tragedies. \\"We understand that this incident was an extreme and isolated event, but it highlights the need for awareness and education on multiple fronts,\\" explained Hayes. \\"By addressing mental health, alongside our ongoing efforts to protect wildlife, we hope to foster a safer, more respectful environment for both our visitors and the natural inhabitants of Yellowstone.\\" \\"Hope's Hollow\\" has quickly become a site of reflection for many visitors, serving as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the impact of human actions on the natural world. The area, once marked by tragedy, now stands as a testament to the resilience of the community and its dedication to ensuring that Hope's death was not in vain but instead a catalyst for positive change."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where the man is now in extreme custody","output":"Following the disturbing incident at Yellowstone National Park, where a man threw a baby rabbit into a boiling mud pot, resulting in widespread shock and condemnation, authorities have taken stringent measures against the individual involved. The perpetrator, who has not been named publicly due to legal restrictions, is now under extreme custody, reflecting the severity of the crime and the public outcry that followed. In the immediate aftermath of the event, the man was apprehended by park rangers and initially held on charges of animal cruelty and violating park regulations. However, given the nature of the act and its impact on public safety and wildlife protection, legal proceedings rapidly escalated. The court, taking into account the man's erratic behavior and the malicious intent evident in his actions, ruled for him to be held under a higher level of surveillance and confinement. Under extreme custody, the individual is housed in a high-security detention facility, where he undergoes rigorous psychological evaluation to assess his mental health and potential risks to society. This measure not only aims to address the gravity of the offense but also underscores the commitment of law enforcement and the judicial system to safeguard wildlife and uphold public safety within national parks. The decision to place the man in extreme custody sparked a broader dialogue on the intersection of mental health issues, legal consequences, and wildlife protection. Advocates for animal rights and environmental protection have lauded the move, seeing it as a significant step toward deterring potential offenders and ensuring such acts of cruelty are met with appropriate repercussions. Park spokesperson Martin Hayes commented on the development, stating, \\"While we can never undo the harm that was done, the decision to impose extreme custody on the individual responsible sends a clear message about our collective intolerance for violence against wildlife and the importance of respecting the sanctity of our national parks.\\" In response to the incident, Yellowstone National Park has also ramped up its efforts to educate visitors on the importance of preserving natural habitats and respecting wildlife. Enhanced signage, increased ranger patrols, and new visitor orientation programs are part of the park's ongoing initiatives to prevent future occurrences and ensure the safety and well-being of both its human visitors and animal inhabitants. Legal experts highlight this case as a precedent-setting moment, potentially influencing how future wildlife-related offenses are handled within the legal system. The emphasis on mental health evaluation and the application of stringent custody measures reflect a holistic approach to addressing acts of cruelty, balancing the need for punishment with the understanding of underlying issues that may contribute to such behavior. As the man awaits further legal proceedings under extreme custody, the community and advocates continue to honor the memory of the baby rabbit through conservation efforts and educational outreach, turning a tragic event into a catalyst for positive change and increased awareness around the protection of wildlife."},{"instruction":"I have this form in NextJS 14: import {authenticate} from '@/app/lib/actions'; const [errorMessage, dispatch] = useFormState(authenticate, undefined); <form action={dispatch} className='space-y-6'> This is the action: export async function authenticate( prevState: string | undefined, formData: FormData ) { try { console.log('Hello world!'); await signIn('credentials', formData); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof AuthError) { switch (error.type) { case 'CredentialsSignin': return 'Invalid password.'; default: return 'Something went wrong.'; } } throw error; } } However, after submitting the form, I just get a 404 error for the /sign-in path with the POST method.","output":"It seems like there may be an issue with how you are handling the form submission in your NextJS application.

The day had barely begun, yet a peculiar sense of foreboding hung in the air, as if forewarning him of an impending storm. Daniel, an unassuming middle-aged man with a life as monotonous as it was honest, brushed aside the feeling as a mere figment of his imagination. Suddenly, the tranquility was shattered by an insistent knocking at the front door. The clock above the mantelpiece read 6:47 AM. Curiosity mingled with unease as Daniel set his coffee aside and made his way to the door. Upon opening it, he was met with the grim faces of two police officers, their badges gleaming in the morning light. \\"Daniel Wright?\\" the taller officer inquired, his tone betraying no emotion. \\"Yes, that's me,\\" Daniel replied, his heart starting to race. \\"Is there something wrong?\\" \\"Mr. Wright, you are under arrest,\\" announced the other officer, stepping forward, handcuffs at the ready. The words hit Daniel like a punch to the gut, knocking the air from his lungs. \\"Arrest? For what? There must be some mistake,\\" he stammered, his mind racing through his life's mundane routine, searching for any misstep that could have led to this moment. \\"We suggest you cooperate and come with us, sir. You're gonna be late for prison if you don't move,\\" the taller officer interjected, a hint of impatience in his voice. The absurdity of the situation would have been laughable had it not been so terrifyingly real. Daniel found himself ushered into the back of the police car, his protests falling on deaf ears. As the car sped through the still awakening streets, Daniel's mind was a whirlwind of confusion and fear. What crime could he possibly have committed to deserve this fate? Upon their arrival at the station, Daniel was processed with an efficiency that felt brutally impersonal. He demanded to speak to a lawyer, still clinging to the hope that this nightmare would be resolved as quickly as it had begun. However, hours turned into days, and Daniel found himself transferred to a correctional facility, the reality of his situation becoming increasingly difficult to deny. In the stark, unforgiving environment of the prison, Daniel was forced to adapt to a life he had never imagined possible. He was a man of principle, wrongly accused, trapped in a world where innocence was a luxury few could afford. Yet, in the echoes of the barred corridors and the whispers of fellow inmates, Daniel discovered the resilience of the human spirit. Months passed, and the truth finally came to light. A case of mistaken identity, a clerical error that had spiraled into a living nightmare for an innocent man. Daniel was released, his freedom restored, but the scars of his ordeal remained, a constant reminder of the fragility of justice. As he stood once again by his window, sipping his coffee in the early morning light, Daniel couldn't help but reflect on the surreal twist of fate that had led him on such a harrowing journey. The words \\"You're gonna be late for prison if you don't move\\" echoed in his memory, a bizarre prelude to an experience that had changed him forever. Daniel knew that life outside the prison walls would never be the same. But armed with a newfound appreciation for the preciousness of freedom and an unshakable resolve to rebuild, he faced the uncertainty of the future with a quiet strength. For in the depths of despair, he had found a resilience he never knew he possessed, and it was this discovery that would guide him through whatever challenges lay ahead."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a family going on holiday to Wuhu Island","output":"Once upon a summer, in a quaint and bustling town, the Parker family was teeming with excitement. Tom and Jenna Parker, along with their children, Lily and Max, had been planning their dream vacation for months, and the moment had finally arrived. They were going to the enchanting Wuhu Island, a place whispered about amongst their friends as a paradise of endless fun and adventure. The day before their departure was filled with chaos and laughter as the Parkers packed everything they thought they could possibly need. Swimsuits, snorkels, hiking boots, and, of course, an array of cameras to capture every moment - nothing was left behind. As they boarded the plane the next morning, the anticipation was palpable. Lily, who had recently turned twelve, was practically bouncing in her seat, her eyes glued to the window, eager to catch the first glimpse of the island. Eight-year-old Max, with his teddy bear securely tucked under his arm, shared his sister's enthusiasm, albeit with a bit more restraint. Upon arrival, a warm breeze greeted them, carrying with it the fragrant scent of tropical flora. The sun painted everything in a golden hue, making the island seem even more magical. The Parkers were welcomed with genuine smiles and refreshing beverages at the quaint resort that would be their home for the next two weeks. Their holiday was everything they had hoped for and more. The family explored every corner of Wuhu Island, from its pristine beaches to its lush, verdant jungles. They competed in friendly family competitions, including cycling races around the island's winding paths, frisbee games on the soft sandy beaches, and even a thrilling archery contest. One of their most memorable adventures was the day they spent kayaking around the island, navigating through crystal-clear waters. They marveled at the vibrant marine life below, with schools of colorful fish darting beneath their boats and curious sea turtles glancing up as they passed. Evenings on Wuhu Island were just as magical. After days filled with activity, the Parkers would often find themselves at a cozy beachside spot, where they’d watch the sunset paint the sky in shades of pink and orange. Stories and laughter were shared over delicious, locally-sourced meals, forging bonds that felt even stronger under the starlit sky. Throughout their holiday, Tom and Jenna saw their children grow in ways they hadn't imagined. Lily's confidence soared as she took the lead during their explorations, while Max discovered a newfound love for nature, insisting on photographing every new plant and animal he encountered. As their vacation drew to a close, the Parkers knew they were taking more than just souvenirs back home with them. They were returning with a treasure trove of memories, a deeper sense of connection, and a unanimous decision that Wuhu Island would see the Parkers again. Their journey back was quiet, a content silence filled with personal reveries of the days spent in paradise. Tom and Jenna exchanged glances, a silent agreement passing between them. The holiday may have ended, but the adventure, the joy, and the magic of Wuhu Island would live on in their hearts forever."},{"instruction":"I want to program the Political Compass plot from the Political Compass Test in Python with matplotlib.

The short story: \\"The afternoon sun hung heavy, a molten sphere scorching the endless rows of avocado trees. Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with the dust swirling around her ankles like a vengeful dervish. Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill, but she held them captive. Her father had called her the strongest girl he knew, and this wasn't the time to falter. Small hands, roughened by labor, brushed against the gnarled bark of the towering trees as she weaved through the labyrinth. Two overflowing burlap sacks, the spoils of her arduous harvest, dragged behind her, leaving parallel furrows in the parched earth. Reaching the ramshackle cottage nestled within the plantation's heart, her father's temporary haven during the avocado season, was paramount. He must be waiting. An ominous shift in the sky turned the day as dark as her mood. Fat, pregnant clouds swallowed the sun whole, and a low rumble of thunder echoed like a distant giant clearing its throat. Fear flickered in her eyes, and her pace quickened. The trees, once stoic sentinels, morphed into menacing figures, their branches twisting and clawing at her like skeletal fingers. The avocados thumped a frantic rhythm against her legs with each desperate stride. Blinded by the sudden downpour and unaware of the treacherous dip in the terrain, she tripped. The world dissolved into a chaotic blur as she tumbled down the incline, a cascade of green hurtling with her. When she clambered to her feet, the rain was a relentless curtain obscuring everything. Panic clawed at her throat, but she forced it down. Her heart hammered a frantic counterpoint against her ribs. Squinting through the deluge, disappointment settled in her stomach like a lead weight. This wasn't the familiar silhouette of the cottage. Instead, a vast pond mirrored the roiling sky, its placid surface now a churning cauldron. It would have been breathtaking under any other circumstance. How long had she been lost? The day, which had begun with the promise of shared laughter and the joy of harvest, had morphed into a desperate struggle for survival. The reflection of the storm in the pond's surface created an unsettling tableau, both beautiful and terrifying. Parched and desperate, she sank to the ground, the cool dampness seeping through her clothes. A tentative touch dipped into the inky water. Cupping her hand, she brought the life-giving liquid to her lips, the first sip a symphony on her parched tongue. A sliver of peace, fragile and fleeting, washed over her. Suddenly, the earth tilted beneath her, and she plunged into the unforgiving depths. Panic seized her, her limbs flailing uselessly. The world dissolved into darkness, punctuated only by the muffled thrum of her own heartbeat. As the last vestiges of air surrendered to the water, an inexplicable force surged beneath her, lifting her towards the surface. With a gasp, she was deposited unceremoniously onto the muddy bank, far from the treacherous pond. Sprawled on the slick earth, she fought to regain her breath, the taste of fear lingering in her mouth. She wasn't alone. A low growl rumbled beside her. A large, mud-caked dog materialized, its tail wagging furiously, a counterpoint to the storm's fury. Relief flooded her. Relief, and a spark of recognition. Dangling from the dog's mouth, like a battle-won trophy, were the remnants of her torn avocado bags. The dog nudged her with its wet nose, its excited barks punctuated by the storm's relentless assault. A realization dawned. This wasn't just any dog; it was a familiar presence, one that had likely seen the cottage before. Perhaps it was leading her back, a furry beacon in the storm. As if in response to her silent plea, a voice, thin and stretched by distance, pierced the storm's roar. \\"Darling!\\" It was her father, his voice raw with panic. \\"Dad! Here!\\" she screamed back, her voice hoarse but filled with newfound strength. The rain continued its relentless assault, but through the downpour, a figure emerged, a silhouette pushing back against the angry sky. It was him. Her father. \\"","output":"Analyzing the short story through the lens of screenwriting involves examining its components such as structure, story, character, text, and overall themes and genres.

There might be a typo or a misunderstanding about the current directory versus the target directory. 2. **Check Hidden Files and Folders**: Ensure that your folder view settings are configured to show hidden files and folders. Sometimes, files beginning with a dot (.) are considered hidden in many operating systems, including Windows. 3. **Confirm User Permissions**: Make sure that your user account has the necessary permissions to write to the specified directory. Lack of proper permissions might result in a process that appears to complete but does not actually write files to the disk. 4. **Review Log for Errors**: Even though the log excerpt you shared doesn't show errors, check the entire log for any messages that might indicate a problem during the download or merging process. 5. **Inspect the Download Tool's Behavior**: There could be a bug or unexpected behavior in the \`hfdownloader\` tool, especially if it's a third-party tool or script not widely tested. Look for documentation or forums for any known issues similar to yours. 6. **Disk Space and File System**: Ensure there's enough disk space on your drive for the files you're downloading. Additionally, check if the file system (e.g., NTFS for Windows) has any peculiarities or limitations relevant to your operation. 7. **Try an Alternative Method**: As a workaround, you could try manually downloading the model from the Hugging Face website if it's available for direct download or use the official \`git lfs\` command if the model is stored using Git Large File Storage. 8. **Use the Command Line Carefully**: If you're running this in a script or from a command line, ensure the path and command are not truncated or incorrectly formatted. For complex paths, consider enclosing them in double quotes. 9. **Restart and Retry**: Sometimes, a simple system restart can resolve unexpected issues. It also helps to retry the download to see if the problem persists. 10. **Check with the Model Provider**: There might be specific instructions or requirements for downloading the model that are not met, leading to this issue. Consulting the provider's documentation or support channels may offer a solution. If, after going through these steps, you still cannot locate the files, it could be beneficial to reach out to the support forums or communities related to \`hfdownloader\` or Hugging Face for more detailed assistance."},{"instruction":"for some reason the files downloaded to this path: \\"\\"C:Usersbower.ollamamodelsbinvicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\\"\\"","output":"It seems like the files were downloaded to the intended directory but perhaps not where you initially expected them to be. This can happen due to a misunderstanding of the command's output or the specifics of how the downloader tool constructs the path for downloads. Based on your earlier message and the outcome, here's a breakdown of what likely happened: 1. **Specified Path in Command**: You provided a path that ended with \`bin\`, which would typically mean you intended for the files to be downloaded directly into that directory. However, the downloader tool might append the model's name or identifier to the specified path to organize downloads, especially when dealing with models from sources like Hugging Face. 2. **Automatic Directory Creation**: The downloader tool (\`hfdownloader_windows_amd64_1.3.4\`) appears to automatically create a subdirectory (\\"\`vicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\`\\") within your specified path to store the downloaded model's files. This behavior is quite common in tools designed to handle model downloads, as it keeps models organized and separated, preventing file name conflicts and making it easier to manage multiple models. Here’s a quick guide on what to do next: - **Locating Your Files**: Navigate to \`\\"C:Usersbower.ollamamodelsbinvicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\\"\`. You should find the downloaded model files there. This path suggests that everything worked as intended, with the \`vicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\` directory being automatically created to house the model files. - **Future Downloads**: For future reference, when you specify a path for downloads using tools like this one, anticipate the possibility that the tool might create subdirectories based on model names or other criteria to keep things organized. - **Using the Model**: With the files now located, you can proceed with whatever task you have planned for the model, whether it's for machine learning, data analysis, or any other purpose that requires the use of such a model. If you need to work with these files directly or with a specific software/tool that requires the model to be in a different directory, you can either move the entire \`vicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\` directory to the preferred location or adjust the software/tool settings to point to the current location of the model files."},{"instruction":"why didn't this work (using docker): \\"\\"C:Usersbower.ollamamodelsblobsvicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B>docker run --rm -v .:/model ollama/quantize -q q5_K_M /model /workdir/llama.cpp/gguf-py Loading model file /model/model-00001-of-00004.safetensors Loading model file /model/model-00001-of-00004.safetensors Loading model file /model/model-00002-of-00004.safetensors Loading model file /model/model-00003-of-00004.safetensors Loading model file /model/model-00004-of-00004.safetensors params = Params(n_vocab=128256, n_embd=4096, n_layer=32, n_ctx=8192, n_ff=14336, n_head=32, n_head_kv=8, f_norm_eps=1e-05, n_experts=None, n_experts_used=None, rope_scaling_type=None, f_rope_freq_base=500000.0, f_rope_scale=None, n_orig_ctx=None, rope_finetuned=None, ftype=<GGMLFileType.MostlyF16: 1>, path_model=PosixPath('/model')) Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"/workdir/llama.cpp/convert.py\\", line 1658, in <module> main(sys.argv[1:]) # Exclude the first element (script name) from sys.argv File \\"/workdir/llama.cpp/convert.py\\", line 1614, in main vocab, special_vocab = vocab_factory.load_vocab(args.vocab_type, model_parent_path) File \\"/workdir/llama.cpp/convert.py\\", line 1409, in load_vocab path = self._select_file(vocabtype) File \\"/workdir/llama.cpp/convert.py\\", line 1384, in _select_file raise FileNotFoundError(f\\"{vocabtype} {file_key} not found.\\") FileNotFoundError: spm tokenizer.model not found.

Specifically, the error message: \`\`\`plaintext FileNotFoundError: spm tokenizer.model not found. \`\`\` suggests that a SentencePiece model (usually named something akin to \`tokenizer.model\`) that should be used during the quantization process is not found in the directory you've mounted into the Docker container. This file is crucial for processing the model data, and its absence halts the operation. Additionally, there's an issue with how you've mounted the directory to the Docker container. The \`-v\` flag in your command is problematic: \`\`\`shell -v .:/model \`\`\` The \`.\` (dot) is meant to refer to the current directory in shell commands, but when called from within a Windows command prompt (CMD) environment or PowerShell, it may not be correctly interpreted. Instead, Docker expects an absolute path for the volume mapping. Here's how to address these issues: 1. **Ensure the Required Files Are Present**: Make sure that the SentencePiece model file (\`tokenizer.model\` or similarly named) is in the directory that you're attempting to mount into the Docker container. This usually involves checking the model's documentation or source to see if there are additional files you need to download. 2. **Correctly Mount the Directory**: Convert the relative path (.) to an absolute path, and make sure to use the correct syntax for your operating system. For Windows, it might look something like this: \`\`\`shell docker run --rm -v C:Usersbower.ollamamodelsblobsvicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B:/model ollama/quantize -q q5_K_M /model \`\`\` Note: Docker on Windows sometimes has issues with path formats, especially regarding drive letter casing or using backslashes (\`\`). If you encounter a problem with the above command, try the following adjustments: - Use forward slashes (\`/\`) instead of backslashes (\`\`). - Ensure that your drive letter is lowercase or as Docker expects. 3. **Check Docker Volume Mounts on Windows**: If you're still having issues with volume mounts, ensure Docker for Windows is configured correctly to share local drives. This is a common setup step that if missed, could lead to volume mount issues.

Looking at the content of your directory listing, it appears that this specific file (\`tokenizer.model\`) is indeed missing. The presence of files like \`tokenizer.json\` and \`tokenizer_config.json\` suggests that a tokenizer configuration is available, but the \`tokenizer.model\` file, likely required for a SentencePiece tokenizer, is not present. Here are a few steps and considerations for resolving this issue: 1. **Check Model Requirements**: Ensure that the \`tokenizer.model\` file is not a separate requirement or download for the model you're working with. Sometimes model and tokenizer files are hosted separately, and it's possible that you might need to download additional files from the source. 2. **Download Missing File**: If you find that the \`tokenizer.model\` file needs to be downloaded separately, make sure to place it in the same directory as the other files (\`C:Usersbower.ollamamodelsblobsvicgalle_Unsafe-Llama-3-8B\`) so that it becomes accessible to the Docker container. 3. **Correct File Names or Paths**: If there's a possibility that the required tokenizer model file is named differently (and is already present in your directory), you might need to adjust your process or script to properly refer to the available file. However, based on the stated error, it specifically looks for a \`tokenizer.model\` file, which suggests that a differently named file won't resolve the issue without altering the process expecting this exact file name. 4. **Review Documentation**: Look through any available documentation for the \`ollama/quantize\` Docker image or the model you are working with. It’s possible there could be specific instructions or requirements regarding the tokenizer file that could clarify why the \`tokenizer.model\` file is missing or its expected content. 5. **Alternatives and Workarounds**: If the quantization process you're attempting to run requires a SentencePiece model, but you only have the tokenizer's configuration and JSON files, there might be a need to generate or obtain the \`.model\` file separately. This could involve using the tokenizer's configuration (if related to SentencePiece) to train or recreate the required \`.model\` file, though this is more complex and beyond a simple fix. Considering you've done everything correctly thus far, the absence of the \`tokenizer.model\` file is the primary issue. The solution would primarily involve obtaining this file and ensuring it's in the directory you're mounting to the Docker container. If the file is supposed to be generated as part of a previous step or process, revisit those steps to ensure everything was completed successfully."},{"instruction":"Write a news article about an ad by \\"The Commitee for Living Happy\\" telling us \\"Don't commit you know whaticide, commmit Lifeicide, Live in the moment, enjoy every good thing this life has to offer, because your friends and family are here for you\\"","output":"**New \\"Commit to Life\\" Campaign Aims to Spread Positivity and Support Amidst Mental Health Crisis** In a creative and heartfelt endeavor to address the rising concerns of mental health issues, The Committee for Living Happy has launched a new advertising campaign titled \\"Commit to Life.\\" With a unique approach to a delicate topic, the ad encourages individuals facing hard times to choose life and happiness over despair, using the coined term \\"Lifeicide\\" to signify the act of committing wholeheartedly to life.

Empecemos de nuevo, enfocándonos esta vez en el uso específico de los compartimentos de tu lavadora Siemens iQdrive 500. Aunque es importante señalar que no hay un método mágico para hacer que una prenda vieja luzca completamente nueva, especialmente si está muy gastada, sí hay maneras de intentar mejorar su aspecto significativamente. Veamos qué poner en cada compartimento: # Compartimentos de la Lavadora Las lavadoras suelen tener tres compartimentos en la bandeja del detergente. Aunque los símbolos pueden variar, generalmente se distinguen de la siguiente manera: 1. **Pre-lavado**: Este es el primer compartimento y se usa cuando seleccionas un ciclo de pre-lavado en la lavadora. Aquí añadirías un poco de detergente si tu chándal está extremadamente sucio. Sin embargo, para la mayoría de los lavados cotidianos, se puede dejar vacío. 2. **Lavado principal**: Aquí es donde pones el detergente para el ciclo principal de lavado. Utiliza detergente de buena calidad que sea adecuado para colores, para ayudar a proteger la tela y los colores de tu chándal. Es importante no excederse con la cantidad recomendada por el fabricante del detergente, ya que demasiado detergente puede dejar residuos en la ropa y en la lavadora. 3. **Suavizante**: Este compartimento se destina para el suavizante de telas. El suavizante puede ayudar a que tu chándal se sienta suave y huela fresco después del lavado. No obstante, es opcional y debe usarse conforme a las instrucciones del producto, ya que un exceso podría afectar la capacidad de absorción y frescura de la prenda a largo plazo. # Pasos Adicionales - **Detergente**: Usa un detergente diseñado para conservar el color de las prendas. Si tu chándal tiene manchas, considera aplicar un tratamiento previo directamente sobre las manchas antes de ponerlo en la lavadora. - **Ciclo de Lavado**: Selecciona un ciclo de lavado para prendas de color. Evita lavados a altas temperaturas que podrían hacer que los colores se desvanezcan más rápido. - **Cantidad de Ropa**: No sobrecargues la lavadora. Una carga demasiado llena puede resultar en una limpieza y aclarado ineficaces. Finalmente, ten en cuenta que aunque estos pasos pueden ayudar a mejorar la apariencia de tu chándal, el resultado final dependerá mucho del estado inicial de la prenda y de cuánto ha desvanecido o se ha desgastado el material con el tiempo. Para prendas especialmente valiosas o delicadas, siempre es una buena idea consultar las instrucciones de cuidado del fabricante o considerar la limpieza profesional."},{"instruction":"Te has confundido.

Mode collapse: GANs are prone to mode collapse, where the generator learns to produce only a few samples that fool the discriminator, leading to a lack of diversity in generated samples. 2. Training instability: GAN training can be unstable and difficult to converge, requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters and training procedures to achieve good results. 3. Explicit representation of likelihood: VAEs assume a simple form of the posterior distribution and can struggle to model complex distributions in high-dimensional spaces. 4. Trade-off between reconstruction quality and sample diversity: VAEs typically struggle to generate high-quality samples while maintaining diversity in the generated samples. 5. Limited capacity to model long-range dependencies: Both GANs and VAEs can struggle to model long-range dependencies in sequential data, such as in natural language processing tasks. 6. Difficulty in capturing fine-grained details: GANs and VAEs can struggle to capture fine-grained details in images or generate high-resolution images with realistic details. 7. Sensitivity to hyperparameters: Both GANs and VAEs require careful tuning of hyperparameters, which can be time-consuming and challenging for users without expertise in machine learning."},{"instruction":"introduction of diffusion models","output":"Diffusion models, also known as autoregressive generative models, are a class of generative models that have gained popularity in recent years for their ability to generate realistic samples and model complex high-dimensional data distributions. These models are based on the concept of iteratively diffusing noise to generate samples that resemble data from the target distribution. In diffusion models, the process of generating samples involves transforming an initial noise distribution through a series of diffusion steps. At each step, the noise distribution is updated by adding noise and applying a series of invertible transformations. These transformations gradually push the noise distribution towards the target data distribution over multiple steps, resulting in the generation of high-quality samples. Diffusion models have been shown to be capable of capturing complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples across various domains, such as image generation, speech synthesis, and natural language processing. They have also demonstrated improved sample quality and stability compared to other generative models like GANs and VAEs. One of the key advantages of diffusion models is their ability to model long-range dependencies and capture fine-grained details in the generated samples. They are also less prone to issues like mode collapse and training instability, making them an attractive choice for researchers and practitioners working on generative modeling tasks. Overall, diffusion models represent a promising approach to generative modeling that continues to advance the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, offering new opportunities for generating realistic and diverse samples from complex data distributions."},{"instruction":"Explain the details of diffusion models","output":"Diffusion models are a type of generative model that operates by iteratively diffusing noise to generate samples from a data distribution.

This noise distribution serves as the starting point for generating samples that approximate the target data distribution. 2. Diffusion process: The noise distribution is iteratively transformed through a series of diffusion steps. At each step, noise is added to the current distribution, and a series of invertible transformations are applied to gradually push the noise distribution towards the target data distribution. 3. Invertible transformations: The transformations applied in diffusion models must be invertible, meaning that they can be reversed to recover the original input. This property ensures that the model can generate realistic samples and learn the data distribution effectively. 4. Training procedure: Diffusion models are typically trained using maximum likelihood estimation, where the model learns to maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the noise distribution and the learned transformations. This training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the difference between the generated samples and the real data distribution. 5. Generation process: To generate samples using a trained diffusion model, the process involves starting with noise from the initial distribution and applying the learned invertible transformations in reverse order to generate a sample that resembles the target data distribution. 6. Applications: Diffusion models have been applied to various generative modeling tasks, including image generation, video prediction, image inpainting, and data denoising. They have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions, generating high-quality samples, and modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. Overall, diffusion models offer a promising approach to generative modeling by leveraging the concept of iteratively diffusing noise to generate samples that closely match the target data distribution. Their ability to capture fine-grained details, model complex data distributions, and generate high-fidelity samples makes them a valuable tool in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning."},{"instruction":"Explain the training process of diffusion models ?","output":"The training process of diffusion models involves optimizing the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the noise distribution and the learned invertible transformations. Here is a detailed explanation of the training process for diffusion models: 1. Data preparation: The first step in training a diffusion model is to prepare the training data. This involves gathering a dataset of samples that represent the target data distribution that the model aims to learn and generate samples from. 2. Initialization: The model parameters, including the invertible transformations and any other components of the diffusion model, are initialized randomly. These parameters will be updated during training to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. 3. Forward diffusion process: During training, the noise distribution is iteratively transformed through a series of diffusion steps. At each step, noise is added to the current distribution, and the invertible transformations learned by the model are applied to update the noise distribution. This process gradually pushes the noise distribution towards the target data distribution. 4. Likelihood maximization: The goal of the training process is to maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the noise distribution and the learned transformations. This is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation, where the model is trained to minimize the difference between the generated samples and the real data distribution. 5. Optimization: The model parameters, including the invertible transformations and any other components of the diffusion model, are updated using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The parameters are adjusted iteratively to reduce the difference between the generated samples and the real data distribution. 6. Training iterations: The training process involves iterating through the dataset multiple times, known as epochs, to update the model parameters and improve the likelihood of the observed data. The model continues to learn and refine its representations through the diffusion process and optimization of the parameters. 7. Evaluation: Throughout the training process, the performance of the diffusion model is evaluated using metrics such as log-likelihood, sample quality, and diversity of generated samples. This helps monitor the progress of the model and guide adjustments to the training procedure if needed. By following these steps and optimizing the likelihood of the observed data, diffusion models can learn the target data distribution and generate realistic samples that capture the complexity and structure of the data. The training process is crucial for the model to effectively learn the data distribution and produce high-quality samples in generative modeling tasks."},{"instruction":"I am using docker-compose, where I pull the image from the hub, BUT I need to modify it using my Dockerfile (inside there is only copy command for config file), the docker-compose.yml looks like below, can you help me fix it? version: '3' services: nginx: build: context: . args: - NODE_ENV=local dockerfile: Dockerfile image: docker.io/nginx:latest ports: - \\"8080:80\\" - \\"8443:443\\" volumes: - /var/www/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro - /var/www/ssl:/etc/nginx/certs:ro restart: always","output":"Given the scenario you've described, you want to use a Dockerfile to modify an existing Docker image; in this case, it's an Nginx image from Docker Hub. To accomplish this while retaining the structure of your \`docker-compose.yml\`, there are a couple of steps and changes you need to make. First, ensure your Dockerfile correctly modifies the base image. Since you've mentioned the Dockerfile only includes a copy command for a configuration file, I will assume you're trying to copy a custom Nginx configuration file into the image. Your Dockerfile might look something like this: \`\`\`Dockerfile # Use the official Nginx image as the base FROM nginx:latest # Copy custom nginx configuration file COPY ./my-nginx-config.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf \`\`\` Make sure that \`my-nginx-config.conf\` is located in the same directory as your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, or adjust the path accordingly. Now, let's adjust your \`docker-compose.yml\`. The issue here seems to be that you're trying to both build an image and specify an image from Docker Hub directly. What you likely want to do is to build your own image (based on the Nginx image) and use that. Let's adjust your file: \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: nginx: build: context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile ports: - \\"8080:80\\" - \\"8443:443\\" volumes: - /var/www/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro - /var/www/ssl:/etc/nginx/certs:ro restart: always \`\`\` A few notes on this: - I've removed the \`args\` section since it wasn't being used in the provided Dockerfile snippet. If your actual Dockerfile uses build arguments (for other purposes not shown here), you can indeed define them in the 'args' section. - The \`image: docker.io/nginx:latest\` line has been removed. You don't need to specify this in your docker-compose file since you are building your image from the Dockerfile, which already specifies \`nginx:latest\` as the base image. However, if you want to tag your built image for later use or reference, you can add an \`image\` line with your own tag, like so: \`\`\`yaml image: my-custom-nginx:latest \`\`\` This setup instructs Docker Compose to build an image using your Dockerfile (which itself is based on the official Nginx image) and then use that image for the \`nginx\` service within your \`docker-compose.yml\`. After running \`docker-compose up --build\`, Docker Compose will build (or rebuild) the image and then run a container using that image."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This decision has quickly become a major point of controversy within the gaming community, sparking accusations of draconian measures by one of the most beloved names in the industry. The policy, which came into effect earlier this week, aims to encourage gamers to transition to the newer Nintendo Switch system. According to an official statement from the company, this move is intended to “unify the gaming experience” and ensure that all Nintendo users have access to the latest technology and game library. However, the approach has not been well-received. Reports have flooded social media of individuals being visited by Nintendo representatives, politely but firmly requesting the handover of any Wii, 3DS, or Wii U consoles. These reports are accompanied by a growing outcry from gamers who do not wish to part with their older systems, either for reasons of nostalgia or because not everyone is convinced the Switch meets their gaming needs. Long-time Nintendo fan, Jordan Miles, expressed dissatisfaction with the new policy: \\"This is draconian, to say the least. My Wii has memories attached to it, games that I can’t just transfer to the Switch. Not to mention, not everyone can afford to make the switch to the Switch.” Critics have pointed out the potential legal and ethical implications of Nintendo's actions. Legal experts are debating the rights of the company versus the personal property rights of consumers, with many agreeing that such actions tread in a gray area of consumer law. Additionally, there is a significant portion of the community that views these measures as an aggressive attempt to phase out older consoles, forcing consumers to adopt newer, often more expensive hardware. The nostalgic value of these older systems, along with their unique game libraries, has made them cherished items for many. In response to the backlash, Nintendo has released a follow-up statement, emphasizing their commitment to advancing the gaming experience and hinting at compensation for those who comply with the policy.

Nintendo's bold strategy, intended to usher its user base into the latest generation of gaming, now finds itself at a critical juncture. The company must navigate the delicate balance between innovation and the preservation of its rich gaming heritage—a heritage that for many, includes irreplaceable titles like \\"Super Paper Mario\\" and \\"Tomodachi Life\\" that aren't just games, but gateways to cherished memories."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where they HACK all those consoles using an update, making them show a notice asking users to update,","output":"**Controversial Update: Nintendo Hacks Older Consoles to Push Switch Transition** In a move that has further inflamed tensions between Nintendo and its loyal user base, reports are emerging that the company has initiated a remote update that effectively hacks Wii, 3DS, and Wii U consoles. This update triggers a notice on these older systems, urging users to update their devices—a move perceived by many as an aggressive step to forcibly phase out legacy consoles in favor of the Nintendo Switch. The update appears to be Nintendo's latest tactic in its controversial campaign to migrate gamers to the newer platform. Upon attempting to use their consoles, users are greeted with a persistent message encouraging them to switch to the Switch, blurring the line between a mere suggestion and a coercive push. This has left many gamers outraged, feeling that their personal property is being manipulated without consent. \\"I turned on my Wii U today, and instead of booting up like usual, it displayed this bizarre message telling me it's time to upgrade to the Switch,\\" recounted Alex Moreno, a long-time Nintendo fan. \\"It feels like they've invaded my personal space. It's one thing to stop supporting older consoles, but hacking them to display these messages is a step too far.\\" The backlash has been swift and severe, with gamers and digital rights advocates decrying Nintendo's approach as a violation of consumer rights and ownership. Social media platforms have seen a surge in criticism under the #NintendoHackedUs hashtag, where users are sharing their experiences and voicing their disapproval of the company's tactics. Legal experts are raising concerns about the implications of such an update, questioning the legality of remotely modifying the functionality of consumer-owned devices without explicit permission. \\"This raises significant legal and ethical questions,\\" stated digital rights attorney Samantha Keene. \\"Consumers have rights to the products they own, and companies cannot simply override that ownership because it suits their business strategy.\\" In response to the uproar, a spokesperson for Nintendo issued a brief statement explaining that the update was intended as a \\"friendly reminder\\" of the benefits of upgrading to the Nintendo Switch, including access to a broader library of games and improved hardware performance. However, the statement did little to quell the anger of many in the Nintendo community, who see the action as a betrayal of trust.

Самоанализ напиши в произвольном видеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Проведение урока по данной теме явилось для меня не только возможностью попрактиковаться в роли учителя, но и проверить насколько успешно я могу передать учащимся знания по интересующей их теме. Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения.<br/><br/>В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения.<br/><br/>Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения.<br/><br/>Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности.<br/><br/>Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников.<br/><br/>Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников.<br/><br/>В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем.<br/><br/>В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога.USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT:","output":"Самоанализ моего урока по алгебре на тему \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\" для 8 класса стал значимым этапом в практике преподавания. Этот опыт позволил мне не только применить теоретические знания, полученные в университете, но и понять глубину своей ответственности как учителя за образовательный процесс. Основная цель урока – ознакомить учащихся с неполными квадратными уравнениями и научить их успешно решать такие уравнения. Я постарался сделать урок максимально интерактивным и насыщенным, используя презентацию с визуальными примерами и групповую работу, чтобы способствовать лучшему восприятию и усвоению информации учащимися. В качестве одной из ключевых методик обучения я включил решение задач на доске и работу в парах, что, как мне казалось, должно было способствовать лучшему усвоению материала. Мне удалось охватить различные виды неполных квадратных уравнений, постаравшись обеспечить наиболее ясное понимание методов их решения. Однако, несмотря на мои усилия, во время урока я столкнулся с рядом сложностей. Некоторые ученики испытывали проблемы с концентрацией внимания и не могли полностью сосредоточиться на изложенном материале. Возможно, это было связано с недостаточным использованием игровых элементов и недостаточно четкой структурированностью урока для удержания внимания учащихся. Также я заметил, что наличие однотипных заданий вызвало у некоторых учеников скуку, что показывает мне необходимость более тщательного подбора и дифференциации заданий в зависимости от интересов и уровня подготовки каждого ученика. В заключение, этот опыт учебного урока показал мне важность гибкости и адаптивности в подходах к преподаванию. В дальнейшем я планирую использовать разнообразные методы обучения и контроля, более активно вовлекать учащихся в учебный процесс и уделять больше внимания индивидуальным особенностям и потребностям студентов. Этот урок стал важным уроком и для меня лично, подчеркнув необходимость постоянного самосовершенствования в роли учителя."},{"instruction":"you are an excellent expert in crewai framework , your goal

using agents with roles, goals, memories, and supporting tools within a collaborative process environment. It's structured primarily in Python, making use of classes and functions to facilitate complex operations among agents, their tasks, and the tools they utilize. The codebase includes modules for defining agents, managing tasks, executing those tasks within defined processes (e.g., sequential or hierarchical), and handling tool interactions, memory, caching, and language model calls for generating or parsing text responses. It also illustrates the usage of callbacks and python decorators for dynamic functionality, integration with OpenAI's GPT models, and a focus on extensibility and customization for specific project requirements. To provide a helpful analysis or answer specific questions, could you please clarify what specific aspect of the CrewAI framework you are interested in or need assistance with?"},{"instruction":"give me a detailed example of how to use it with the memory feature","output":"To use the CrewAI framework with the memory feature, you need to set up your crew, agents, and tasks in a way that agents can remember past interactions or context to influence future decisions or actions. This involves leveraging the memory attribute of the agent and potentially using tools and callbacks to manage memory contents practically. For this example, let's assume we want to create a crew with a single agent responsible for answering technical questions. This agent should remember previous questions to avoid providing redundant answers or to build upon past answers. **Step 1: Define the Agent with Memory** First, we define our agent with memory enabled. When memory is enabled (\`memory=True\`), the agent will keep track of the conversation context which can influence its task execution. \`\`\`python from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task from crewai.utilities import I18N, Logger, RPMController class TechSupportAgent(Agent): def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__( role=\\"Tech Support Agent\\", goal=\\"Provide helpful technical support\\", backstory=\\"An experienced tech support agent adept at solving complex issues.\\", memory=True, # Enable memory feature verbose=True, **kwargs ) \`\`\` **Step 2: Define the Task to Be Performed by the Agent** Here, you define what task the agent is supposed to perform. In this case, the task is answering a technical question. \`\`\`python class AnswerTechQuestion(Task): def __init__(self, question: str, **kwargs): super().__init__( description=question, expected_output=\\"An informative and helpful answer to the technical question posed.\\", **kwargs ) \`\`\` **Step 3: Set Up the Crew with the Agent and Task** Now, integrate the agent into a crew and assign it the task. The crew will manage the execution flow. \`\`\`python class TechSupportCrew(Crew): def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__(verbose=True, **kwargs) self.agent = TechSupportAgent() self.task = AnswerTechQuestion(question=\\"How to reset my password?\\", agent=self.agent) def kickoff(self): result = self.task.execute() print(f\\"The agent's response: {result}\\") # Instantiate the crew and start the process crew = TechSupportCrew() crew.kickoff() \`\`\` **Step 4: Implement the Execution Logic with Memory** For the agent to use its memory, ensure the logic that handles task execution (\`execute_task\` method in the agent) is capable of querying the agent's memory and updating it based on the tasks performed. This part requires custom implementation based on specific requirements. How the memory influences task execution depends on the task type, the information stored in memory, and the desired outcomes. **Note:** - This example outlines a structure on how you might set up agents with memory within the CrewAI framework. However, the actual implementation, especially how memory is used to influence decisions, will be specific to your application logic. - The provided code snippets are conceptual. The CrewAI framework, as described, does not directly match any known public Python libraries as of my last training data. Adjustments might be needed to run this with a real or different framework. - The execution of tasks with memory might involve saving conversation history, retrieving relevant past interactions based on current context, or modifying responses accordingly. The detailed logic of these interactions would require access to the agent's method implementations which are responsible for handling the memory feature during task execution. In practice, to effectively use memory in your agents, focus on how the memory stored after each task can be accessed and utilized to make future interactions more contextual and informed, thus providing a comprehensive and evolving support experience."},{"instruction":"Consider the converging and diverging nozzle, where the Mach number is equal to one at the throat, and the Mach number is less than one at the inlet and outlet, and the flow is subsonic. We intend to increase the amount of the cross section in the divergent part by keeping the static pressure of the tank and the pressure downstream of the tank constant. According to this issue, because the ratio of the outlet cross-section to the throat cross-section where Mach 1 is reached, the increase in post-Mach must decrease with the increase of the exit cross-section. On the other hand, since we have said that the downstream pressure and the upstream static pressure are constant, then Mach must remain constant at the outlet. How to explain this contradiction? Prove it to me with a formula and explain this issue with the correct answer.","output":"The contradiction you have described is due to a common misunderstanding when it comes to diverging nozzles. In a converging-diverging nozzle, the flow accelerates in the converging section up to the throat, where the flow reaches Mach 1. Beyond the throat, the flow expands and accelerates further in the diverging section, increasing the velocity and decreasing the static pressure. When the nozzle exit is increased in size, the flow area increases, causing the flow to expand further and slow down. This slowing down of the flow results in a decrease in the Mach number at the exit, even if the upstream and downstream pressures are held constant. This contradiction can be explained using the continuity equation and the mass flow rate formula. The continuity equation states that the mass flow rate is constant along the flow path, given by: {rho}AV = constant Where: ρ = density of the fluid A = cross-sectional area V = velocity of the flow Combining this with the formula for Mach number, which is given by: M = frac{V}{a} Where: M = Mach number V = velocity of the flow a = speed of sound in the fluid If the cross-sectional area is increased at the exit, the velocity of the flow must decrease in order to maintain constant mass flow rate according to the continuity equation. This decrease in velocity results in a decrease in Mach number at the exit, even though the pressures are held constant. In conclusion, the contradiction is resolved by understanding that the expansion of the flow in the diverging section of the nozzle causes the flow to slow down and decrease in Mach number, even if the upstream and downstream pressures are constant."},{"instruction":"Womens Halter Fishtail Bandage Party Dress Elegant Wedding Guest Dress, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","output":"Best Elegant Halter Fishtail Dress for Weddings and Parties"},{"instruction":"Best Elegant Halter Fishtail Dress for Weddings and Parties, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","output":"I recently wore an elegant halter fishtail dress to my cousin's wedding, and it was absolutely stunning!

In an unprecedented move, Nintendo has reportedly started to remotely access Wii, Wii U, and 3DS consoles, displaying a message that cannot be dismissed: \\"It's time to move on to Nintendo Switch.\\" This surprising strategy has angered many longtime fans who still enjoy their older consoles. Further escalating the situation, Nintendo has deployed representatives, humorously referred to as the \\"Switch Squad,\\" who are allegedly visiting homes to collect the older consoles. One of the representatives, who asked to remain anonymous, shared, \\"We’re here to help users make the transition. But it’s non-negotiable; Nintendo is moving forward.\\" The campaign, titled \\"Goodbye Galaxy, Hello Odyssey,\\" also includes a series of ads that juxtapose retiring classics against the vibrant worlds of the Switch, such as the Super Mario Odyssey. While some have applauded the creativity of the ads, others see it as a metaphor for Nintendo’s aggressive push toward the future at the expense of its history. Gaming forums and social media are buzzing with reactions. Sarah Chen, a longtime Nintendo fan, expressed her dismay, saying, \\"It's like they're forcing us to abandon our childhood memories. I love my Wii just as much as the next gen console. This feels like a betrayal.\\" Nintendo issued a statement regarding the campaign: \\"With the ever-evolving gaming landscape, we're excited about the future and want our fans to experience the best we have to offer, which we believe is on the Nintendo Switch. We understand the fondness for our previous systems and games; however, we're committed to bringing everyone along on this journey into the future of gaming.\\" Critics argue that Nintendo’s forceful approach undermines consumer rights and tarnishes their legacy of customer goodwill. Legal experts are debating the legality of remotely accessing and modifying the functionality of consoles without user consent. Despite the controversy, sales of the Nintendo Switch have seen a significant spike since the campaign's launch, suggesting that some fans are indeed ready to say \\"Goodbye Galaxy, Hello Odyssey.\\" However, as the debate rages on, it's clear that this bold strategy has risked alienating a portion of Nintendo’s loyal fan base. Whether this campaign will be remembered as a bold step into the future or a misstep remains to be seen. For now, Nintendo's message is clear: The Switch era has arrived, ready or not."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where a user says \\"How am I supposed to play Tomodachi Life now?, ACNH just isnt the same\\"","output":"**Nintendo's Switch Campaign Faces Backlash from Dedicated Fans** In the wake of Nintendo's aggressive strategy to transition users from the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS platforms to the Switch, a wave of discontent has surged among the gaming community. The campaign, marked by remote messaging on older consoles and the collection of legacy systems, has sparked an unexpected rallying cry around specific games exclusive to these platforms. One voice in the growing chorus is from Alex Ramirez, a die-hard fan of the 3DS classic \\"Tomodachi Life.\\" Ramirez's sentiment, \\"How am I supposed to play 'Tomodachi Life' now? ACNH just isn’t the same,\\" encapsulates a significant concern among Nintendo enthusiasts. While \\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\\" (ACNH) on the Switch has been a massive success, fans of certain niche titles feel left behind. Despite Nintendo's effort to highlight the vast library of the Switch, including new entries in beloved franchises, the unique charm of some older games remains unmatched for a portion of the fan base. \\"Tomodachi Life\\" offered a quirky, personalized experience that many, like Ramirez, haven’t found replicated on the newer console. The sentiment has sparked discussions across gaming forums and social media, with hashtags like #SaveOurGames gaining traction. Fans are calling for Nintendo to consider porting over games that may not have the same widespread appeal as \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" or \\"Super Mario\\" franchises but hold a special place in the hearts of dedicated players. In response to the backlash, some insiders suggest that Nintendo is considering expanding its online service for the Switch to include more titles from the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS era. Though unconfirmed, this move could potentially appease fans by offering a broader selection of legacy content on the latest console. Gaming analyst Rebecca Lin commented, \\"Nintendo’s push for the Switch is understandable from a business standpoint, but they underestimated the attachment fans have to certain games. Offering a broader library that includes these niche titles could be the bridge they need to mend the relationship with their devoted fan base.\\" As the debate continues, it’s clear that while innovation and progress are at the forefront of Nintendo’s strategy, the legacy of its older consoles and the unique experiences they offered are not easily left behind. Whether this feedback loop results in a more inclusive library for the Switch remains to be seen, but for fans like Ramirez, the hope is that their voices will lead to change, ensuring that beloved games like \\"Tomodachi Life\\" find a new home in the Switch era."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where SPM is getting a remaster","output":"**Nintendo Announces \\"Super Paper Mario\\" Remaster Amid Fan Backlash** Amidst a significant backlash from their aggressive push for the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo has announced a new strategy aimed at winning back the hearts of their loyal fan base. In a surprising turn of events, the gaming giant revealed plans for a remastered version of the beloved Wii classic, \\"Super Paper Mario,\\" for the Nintendo Switch. The announcement comes at a pivotal moment for Nintendo, following weeks of criticism over their campaign to decommission older consoles, such as the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. Fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction, particularly regarding the loss of access to their favorite niche and classic titles on these platforms. \\"Super Paper Mario\\" holds a special place in the hearts of many Nintendo fans for its unique blend of platforming and RPG elements, along with its engaging storyline and innovative gameplay mechanics. The decision to remaster this classic for the Switch has been seen as a conciliatory gesture towards fans who felt their concerns were previously ignored. In an official press release, Nintendo expressed their commitment to their community: \\"We've heard our fans loud and clear. Bringing 'Super Paper Mario' to the Switch is just the first step in addressing your concerns. We are dedicated to ensuring our fans have access to their favorite classics and can experience them with the latest technology Nintendo has to offer.\\" The remaster is not merely a straight port; it promises updated graphics, enhanced gameplay mechanics, and additional content not found in the original. Nintendo teased that there would be new story elements, side quests, and even a multiplayer component to further enrich the game's already robust offerings. Reaction to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive, with many seeing it as a sign that Nintendo is truly listening to its fan base. Gaming forums and social media platforms are abuzz with speculation and excitement about what other beloved titles Nintendo might bring to the Switch in the future. Alex Ramirez, previously vocal about their concerns regarding the switch to newer consoles, shared their thoughts: \\"This is exactly what we wanted. 'Super Paper Mario' is a classic, and knowing it's coming to the Switch gives me hope for other titles too. It's a step in the right direction.\\" Nintendo's move to remaster \\"Super Paper Mario\\" for the Switch could mark the beginning of a new phase for the company, where legacy content and modern technology go hand in hand. While it remains to be seen which other titles will be brought into the fold, for now, fans can look forward to revisiting the unique world of \\"Super Paper Mario\\" on the latest Nintendo platform."},{"instruction":"Crée moi une partie pour mon mémoire, sur le report modal avec des sources et des chiffres","output":"**Titre de la section:** L'Importance du Report Modal dans la Réduction de l'Impact Environnemental des Transports **1. Introduction au report modal** Le report modal, défini comme le transfert de l'utilisation d'un mode de transport vers un autre, plus durable et moins polluant, représente une stratégie clé dans la lutte contre les émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) associées au secteur des transports. Il s'inscrit dans une approche globale visant à promouvoir la mobilité durable en réduisant la dépendance à l'égard des véhicules à motorisation individuelle, principalement alimentés par des sources d'énergie fossile. Selon l'Agence Internationale de l'Énergie (AIE, 2020), le secteur des transports est responsable de près de 24% des émissions globales de CO2 liées à l'énergie, soulignant ainsi l'urgence et l'importance d'une transition vers des modes de transport plus verts. **2. Statistiques et études de cas sur le report modal** Diverses études et initiatives à travers le monde illustrent l'efficacité du report modal. Par exemple, une récente étude réalisée par l'Union Internationale des Chemins de fer (UIC, 2022) montre que le ferroviaire, en Europe, est responsable de seulement 0,4% des émissions totales de CO2 du secteur des transports, malgré une part modale de 8,5% pour le transport de passagers et de 18% pour le fret. Ce chiffre contraste fortement avec celui des véhicules routiers, suggérant un potentiel significatif de réduction des émissions par le biais du report modal en faveur du rail. Dans le cadre de la mobilité urbaine, la Ville de Copenhague représente un modèle de réussite en matière de report modal. En 2019, elle a annoncé que les vélos avaient surpassé les voitures en termes de nombre dans les rues pour la première fois, grâce à une politique volontariste de développement des infrastructures cyclables. Cela a non seulement contribué à une réduction des émissions de CO2, mais aussi à l'amélioration de la qualité de l'air et de la santé publique (Municipalité de Copenhague, 2019). **3. Les enjeux du report modal** Le principal enjeu du report modal réside dans la nécessité de repenser et d'améliorer les infrastructures de transport existantes pour les rendre plus attractives et accessibles. Cela implique l'investissement dans les réseaux de transport public, la création de voies réservées aux véhicules non motorisés (vélos, marche), ainsi que le développement de solutions de mobilité partagée. Une autre problématique majeure est la résistance au changement des habitudes de mobilité, qui requiert des politiques intégrées incluant à la fois des mesures incitatives (subventions, avantages fiscaux) et restrictives (taxes, péages urbains). **4. Stratégies et recommandations pour un report modal efficace** Pour favoriser le report modal, les politiques doivent être intégrées et multidimensionnelles, combinant des aspects technologiques, économiques, et sociaux. Par exemple, la promotion des véhicules électriques et l'amélioration de leur accessibilité peut être accompagnée de mesures favorisant les transports en commun et les modes actifs. Le succès repose également sur l'implication active des parties prenantes à tous les niveaux, depuis les décideurs politiques jusqu'aux utilisateurs finaux, en passant par les entreprises de transport et les organisations non gouvernementales. **Conclusion** L'adoption généralisée du report modal apparaît comme une voie incontournable pour atteindre les objectifs de réduction des émissions de GES et de développement durable dans le secteur des transports. En se focalisant sur les stratégies d'amélioration de l'offre de transport durable et d'incitation au changement des comportements, il est possible de réaliser une transition significative vers une mobilité plus verte et plus responsable."},{"instruction":"Pour le 1.

The short story: \\"The afternoon sun hung heavy, a molten sphere scorching the endless rows of avocado trees. Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with the dust swirling around her ankles like a vengeful dervish. Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill, but she held them captive. Papa had called her the strongest girl he knew, and this wasn’t the time to falter. Small hands, roughened by labor, brushed against the gnarled bark of the towering trees as she weaved through the labyrinth. Two overflowing burlap sacks, the spoils of her arduous harvest, dragged behind her, leaving parallel furrows in the parched earth. Reaching the cottage nestled within the plantation’s heart, her father’s haven during the avocado season, was paramount. He must be waiting in worries. An ominous shift in the sky turned the day as dark as her mood. Fat, pregnant clouds swallowed the sun whole, and a low rumble of thunder echoed like a distant giant clearing its throat. Fear flickered in her eyes, and her pace quickened. The trees, once stoic sentinels, morphed into menacing figures, their branches twisting and clawing at her like skeletal fingers. The avocados thumped a frantic rhythm against her legs with each desperate stride. Blinded by the sudden downpour and unaware of the treacherous dip in the terrain, she tripped. The world dissolved into a chaotic blur as she tumbled down the incline, a cascade of green hurtling with her. When she clambered to her feet, the rain was a relentless curtain obscuring everything. Panic clawed at her throat, but she forced it down. Her heart hammered a frantic counterpoint against her ribs. Squinting through the deluge, disappointment settled in her stomach like a lead weight. This wasn’t the familiar silhouette of the cottage. Instead, a vast pond mirrored the roiling sky, its placid surface now a churning cauldron. It would have been breathtaking under any other circumstance. How long had she been lost? The day, which had begun with the promise of shared laughter and the joy of harvest, had morphed into a desperate struggle for survival. The reflection of the storm in the pond’s surface created an unsettling tableau, both beautiful and terrifying. Parched and desperate, she sank to the ground, the cool dampness seeping through her clothes. A tentative touch dipped into the inky water. Cupping her hand, she brought the life-giving liquid to her lips, the first sip a symphony on her parched tongue. A sliver of peace, fragile and fleeting, washed over her. Suddenly, the earth tilted beneath her, and she plunged into the unforgiving depths. Panic seized her, her limbs flailing uselessly. The world dissolved into darkness, punctuated only by the muffled thrum of her own heartbeat. As the last vestiges of air surrendered to the water, an inexplicable force surged beneath her, lifting her towards the surface. With a gasp, she was deposited unceremoniously onto the muddy bank, far from the treacherous pond. Sprawled on the slick earth, she fought to regain her breath, the taste of fear lingering in her mouth. She wasn’t alone. A low growl rumbled beside her. A large, mud-caked dog materialized, its tail wagging furiously, a counterpoint to the storm’s fury. Relief flooded her. Relief, and a spark of recognition. Dangling from the dog’s mouth, like a battle-won trophy, were the remnants of her torn avocado bags. The dog nudged her with its wet nose, its excited barks punctuated by the storm’s relentless assault. A realization dawned. This wasn’t just any dog; it was a familiar presence, one that had likely seen the cottage before. Perhaps it was leading her back, a furry beacon in the storm. As if in response to her silent plea, a voice, thin and stretched by distance, pierced the storm’s roar. “Darling!” It was her father, his voice raw with panic. “Papa! Here!” she screamed back, her voice hoarse but filled with newfound strength. The rain continued its relentless assault, but through the downpour, a figure emerged, a silhouette pushing back against the angry sky. It was him. Papa. \\"","output":"Your short story already possesses a strong foundation, distinctive atmosphere, and emotional weight, all critical elements for screenwriting. However, we can enhance it further by examining it through the lens of screenwriting components: # Structure Organization and Settings - **Current**: The story unfolds linearly, starting from the protagonist's effort to return home, escalating through her accidental fall and ending with a hopeful reunification. The settings transition from an avocado plantation to a dangerous pond, and finally, to a hopeful encounter with her father. - **Suggestions**: Intercut scenes of the father at the cottage, growing increasingly anxious over his daughter's delayed return. This would heighten tension and provide a deeper sense of urgency and stakes. Stage Directions and Special Features - **Current**: Descriptions are vivid, especially the transformative appearance of the trees and the tempest’s imposition on the scene. - **Suggestions**: Incorporate sensory details specific to sounds and smells to mimic a more immersive cinematic experience. Adding more precise stage directions can help actors and directors understand the emotional and physical state of the characters better, e.g., specify the protagonist's physical reactions, like shivering in the rain. # Story Pace and Arc - **Current**: The story's pace accelerates with the onset of the storm and the protagonist's fall, maintaining interest. The arc concludes on a hopeful note, yet feels slightly abrupt. - **Suggestions**: Introduce flashbacks or memories during the protagonist's struggle, adding depth and slowing down moments for emotional resonance. Extend the encounter with her father slightly to allow a more satisfying resolution. # Character Objectives and Obstacles - **Current**: The protagonist's objective to return to the cottage is clear, with nature serving as the primary obstacle. - **Suggestions**: Develop the father’s perspective more, perhaps through brief cuts to show his growing concern and search efforts, which would add another dimension to the story. Relationships and Arc - **Current**: The relationship between the protagonist and her dog presents an interesting dynamic but is introduced late. - **Suggestions**: Hint at this relationship earlier in the story, perhaps in her initial passage through the avocado fields, to establish a subplot that enriches the narrative. # Text Dialogue and Word Choice - **Current**: There is minimal dialogue, which concentrates the story's expressive power in its descriptive passages. - **Suggestions**: Add brief, poignant exchanges between the protagonist and her father at the end. Incorporate dialogue earlier in the story, perhaps her muttering to herself or speaking to the dog, to break the narrative's density and add character insight. # Themes and Genres Atmosphere and Central Image - **Current**: The central images of the storm and the avocado plantation under siege create a vivid atmosphere of struggle against nature. - **Suggestions**: To deepen the atmosphere, incorporate the theme of perseverance not just through physical but also emotional landscapes, emphasizing the inner turmoil mirrored by the storm. Idea and Audience - **Current**: The story speaks to themes of resilience, the bond between father and daughter, and humanity's relationship with nature. - **Suggestions**: Position the story within a broader philosophical or ecological context to give it a more universal appeal. Introducing a subplot or themes related to environmental stewardship or the intergeneration transfer of knowledge and respect for nature can broaden your audience. In conclusion, your short story has all the makings of an emotionally compelling screenplay. By deepening character development, introducing contrasting scenes, enhancing dialogue, and broadening the thematic scope, your screenplay could not only captivate but also leave a lasting impression on its audience."},{"instruction":"Переведи на английский:","output":"Конечно, просто укажите текст, который вы хотите перевести."},{"instruction":"Write a news article about draconian restrictions","output":"**New Draconian Restrictions Spark Global Controversy** Date: October 5, 2023 In an unexpected announcement that has sent shockwaves around the world, the government of Pseudonia has introduced a set of harsh rules and restrictions that critics are calling draconian and unprecedented in modern times. The new legislative measures, which were unveiled late last night by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, impose severe limitations on personal freedoms, internet usage, and public gatherings, drawing widespread condemnation from human rights organizations, foreign governments, and Pseudonia's own citizens. Under the new laws, the government has significantly increased its surveillance capabilities, granting it almost unlimited access to citizens' digital communications without the requirement for a warrant. Social media platforms and internet usage are to be closely monitored, with content deemed \\"unpatriotic\\" or \\"subversive\\" facing immediate censorship. Furthermore, public demonstrations are now subject to strict pre-approval by authorities, and groups of more than five individuals gathering without permission could face arrest and prosecution. Perhaps most controversially, the legislation introduces what has been labeled a \\"loyalty tax,\\" a monthly financial penalty imposed on citizens who fail to participate in government-sponsored patriotic events. This move has been interpreted by many as an attempt to quell dissent and enforce compliance through economic means. The international reaction was swift, with entities such as the United Nations, European Union, and Human Rights Watch expressing profound concern. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated, \\"These measures, as reported, represent a grave encroachment on fundamental human rights and freedoms. We urge the government of Pseudonia to reconsider this approach and engage in open dialogue with its citizenry and the international community.\\" On the streets of Pseudonia's capital, sporadic protests have erupted despite the new restrictions, with citizens showing their defiance in the face of potential arrest. Online, anonymous activists are calling for digital resistance, organizing cyber protests and spreading information on how to bypass internet censorship. The government, however, remains steadfast in its position. In a televised address, President Nomen Nescio defended the new measures, arguing they are necessary for national security and to preserve cultural identity. \\"We must protect our nation from those who seek to undermine it from within and without,\\" Nescio stated. \\"These steps, though tough, are essential for the wellbeing and future prosperity of our people.\\" Critics fear that these draconian measures set a dangerous precedent, potentially encouraging other authoritarian-leaning governments to implement similarly oppressive laws. As the situation in Pseudonia continues to develop, the world watches closely, questioning how far the government will go to maintain control and at what cost to the freedoms and rights of its people.

Senior officials made it clear they are \\"asserting authority\\" and \\"doing what we feel we want because at the end of the day, we're of higher authority than our citizens.\\" This blunt assertion of dominion adds fuel to an already volatile situation, sparking renewed concern from global observers about the state of democracy and human rights in the country. The statement was released during a press conference held by Pseudonia's spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who elaborated that the government's steps were in the \\"best interests of national security and societal stability.\\" The spokesperson further argued that \\"in times of significant internal and external threats, extraordinary measures are justified and necessary.\\" This official stance comes amid reports from within Pseudonia of increased arrests at protests, widespread internet blackouts, and further crackdowns on any form of dissent. Videos and eyewitness accounts leaking out of the country—often through sophisticated means to bypass government surveillance—depict a populace in distress, with many calling for international intervention. Human rights organizations have condemned Pseudonia's latest clarification of its policies, with Amnesty International stating, \\"Claiming a higher authority to suppress and control through fear and repression is a clear violation of human rights. The international community must not stand idly by as the people of Pseudonia are deprived of their fundamental freedoms.\\" The United Nations has convened an emergency session to discuss the situation in Pseudonia, with several member states proposing sanctions and diplomatic measures to pressure the government into reversing its controversial laws. However, Pseudonia has so far dismissed these international responses as \\"infringements on its sovereignty.\\" Within Pseudonia, opposition groups are rallying, despite the risks. Underground networks of activists have begun organizing, using encrypted messaging and covert strategies to evade government detection. One anonymous activist shared, \\"We will not be silenced or intimidated. The government claims a higher authority, but they forget they are supposed to serve the people, not rule over them with an iron fist.\\" As tension escalates, the eyes of the world remain fixed on Pseudonia. The government's stark assertion of authority—and its repercussions for the Pseudonian people and international norms—poses a significant test for global diplomacy and the resilience of democratic principles in the face of authoritarianism. **[End of Article]** *Note: The information presented in this article is a work of fiction intended for illustrative purposes.*"},{"instruction":"Write a story where a crazed man tries to force feed an allergic woman a cheese sandwich, Thankfully he Is arrested","output":"In the tranquil neighborhood of Maplewood, where the mornings were greeted by the song of sparrows and the warm embrace of the sun, a sinister plot was about to unravel, one that would disturb the peace of the small community. Samantha, a young woman known for her kindness and the bright floral dresses she wore, was making her way home from the local library. She had a slight spring in her step, humming softly to herself, completely unaware of the shadow that lurked behind her. The man behind her was known by the townsfolk as \\"Crazy Carl,\\" though few had ever exchanged more than a passing word with him. His wild eyes and unruly beard gave him a forbidding appearance, and today, those eyes were fixed on Samantha with an unsettling intensity. As Samantha turned into the serene lane that led to her home, Carl quickened his pace, clutching a paper bag with a fervor that matched the madness in his eyes. Inside the bag lay a cheese sandwich, crafted meticulously with the very ingredient Samantha had spent her life avoiding due to her severe dairy allergy. \\"Miss!\\" Carl bellowed, startling Samantha, who turned to face the voice with a puzzled frown. \\"Y-Yes?\\" she stammered, taking a step back as Carl’s imposing figure towered over her, the cheese sandwich in his hand. \\"You must eat this, for your own good!\\" Carl insisted, his tone laced with a manic intensity as he thrust the sandwich towards her. Samantha's heart raced, her eyes widening in horror as she recognized the contents of the sandwich. \\"I-I can’t eat that! I’m allergic to cheese!\\" she pleaded, attempting to sidestep Carl and escape. Carl, however, would not be swayed. His belief, fuelled by his delusions, was that he was doing a divine deed, a mission to 'cure' Samantha of her ailment with the very thing that threatened her life. \\"No, you must! It's the only way!\\" he growled, his grip tightening on the sandwich as he attempted to force it closer to Samantha's mouth. In her panic, Samantha's screams pierced the peaceful afternoon, drawing the attention of nearby neighbors who rushed to their windows and then to the street. Mark, an off-duty police officer who resided in the neighborhood, was among the first to react. Without a second thought, he sprinted towards the commotion, his instincts kicking in. He reached Samantha and Carl, assessing the situation in milliseconds. With a swift motion, he tackled Carl to the ground, restraining him with the skilled precision of years in law enforcement. The cheese sandwich, now a symbol of Carl’s madness, lay forgotten on the pavement. \\"Samantha, are you okay?\\" Mark asked, his voice a calming presence amidst the chaos. Shaking, but unharmed, Samantha nodded, her eyes brimming with tears of relief. \\"Yes, thanks to you.\\" Backup arrived shortly after, and Carl was taken away in handcuffs, his protests fading into the distance. The community of Maplewood rallied around Samantha in the days that followed, their support a testament to the strength and kindness that defined them. Samantha, grateful beyond words, found solace in their embrace, her ordeal a harrowing reminder of the fragility of peace. As for Carl, justice was swift. He was placed under psychiatric evaluation, his actions a clear indication of the need for professional intervention. The community breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Samantha was safe once more, and the tranquility of Maplewood was restored.

We intend to increase the amount of the cross section in the divergent part by keeping the static pressure of the tank and the pressure downstream of the tank constant. According to this issue, because the ratio of the outlet cross-section to the throat cross-section where Mach 1 is reached, the increase in post-Mach must decrease with the increase of the exit cross-section. On the other hand, since we have said that the downstream pressure and the upstream static pressure are constant, then Mach must remain constant at the outlet. How to explain this contradiction? Prove it to me with a formula and explain this issue with the correct answer.","output":"The contradiction you are perceiving can be explained by the influence of the area ratio on the Mach number and the flow properties in the converging-diverging nozzle. In a converging-diverging nozzle, the Mach number at the throat (where the flow reaches Mach 1) is given by the formula: Mach number at the throat (M1) = sqrt((2/(gamma-1)) * ( (Pb/P0) ^ ((gamma-1)/gamma) - 1 )) Where: - gamma is the specific heat ratio - Pb is the back pressure (downstream pressure) - P0 is the stagnation pressure (upstream static pressure) To maintain the Mach number at the throat (Mach 1) and the downstream pressure constant, as the nozzle area increases in the diverging section, the Mach number downstream of the throat (M2) must decrease. This means that the flow will remain subsonic at the exit, even though the area is increasing. The contradiction arises from the fact that while the Mach number at the throat remains constant, the Mach number downstream of the throat will decrease with the increase in the diverging section area. This is because the area ratio influences the pressure and velocity distribution in the nozzle, affecting the Mach number at different sections. Therefore, the Mach number at the exit will decrease as the area ratio increases, even though the Mach number at the throat remains constant, resulting in a subsonic flow at the exit of the nozzle."},{"instruction":"Реализуй dqn в pytorch","output":"Вот пример реализации Deep Q-Network (DQN) с использованием библиотеки PyTorch.

However, I can guide you through how to create or understand a ladder diagram for a blower motor control in HVAC systems, which often includes basic elements such as switches, relays, and the motor itself. Ladder diagrams are read from left to right and top to bottom. Each rung on the ladder represents a unique path the current takes to perform a function. Here's a simplified explanation for a basic blower motor control circuit in a ladder diagram format: 1. **Power Supply Lines**: The diagram would have two vertical lines representing the power supply; the left line typically represents the line voltage (hot wire), and the right line is the neutral. In industrial settings, this could represent L1 and L2 for a 240V supply in the U.S., for example. 2. **Circuit Breaker or Switch**: The topmost part of the diagram, just after the power supply line, often includes a representation of a circuit breaker or an ON/OFF switch to control the power supply to the circuit. 3. **Control Relay (Optional)**: For more complex systems, you might have a control relay that the thermostat controls. When the thermostat calls for cooling or heating (dependent on system integration), it activates a relay. This relay is represented as a coil on the diagram and is connected to the control side (low voltage, like 24V in HVAC systems), not directly illustrated in a basic ladder diagram focusing on high-voltage components. 4. **Overload Protection**: Motors need protection from overcurrent, so you might see an overload relay symbol in series with the motor. This is especially critical in industrial setups. 5. **Motor Contacts**: These are represented by a straight line (or sometimes a pair of lines for reversing applications) that shows the electrical connection to the motor. In a blower motor setup, this would represent your motor windings. 6. **Blower Motor**: Finally, the motor itself is typically represented at the bottom of a rung. It might just be shown as an M inside a circle, which stands for \\"motor.\\" Putting it all together, a very simplified ladder diagram for turning a blower motor on and off might have a line switch at the top, then directly connected to the motor representation on one rung (showing a direct control method). If there's low voltage control involved, like from a thermostat, that part of the circuit would be depicted separately or might show a relay coil that, when energized, closes contacts on the main power line to start the motor. Keep in mind, actual motor control circuits can be much more complex, incorporating timers, multiple relay stages, safety interlocks, and speed controls. If you're working on a specific project or repair, referring to the manufacturer's wiring diagram for the exact equipment model is always recommended."},{"instruction":"Write a fake news article where the O2 ABC is finally to be demolished","output":"**Title: \\"Historic O2 ABC Glasgow Set for Demolition After Years of Uncertainty\\"** **Glasgow, Scotland** – In a stunning turn of events, the beloved and historic music venue, the O2 ABC Glasgow, is officially set to be demolished after years of speculation and effort to save the iconic structure. The announcement came early Monday from Glasgow City Council, in conjunction with the building's current owners, Astra Venues, who cited irreparable damage and financial constraints as key reasons for the decision. The O2 ABC, which has graced Sauchiehall Street since the 19th century, originally opened as a diorama theatre in 1875 before transitioning through various iterations including a circus, a dance hall, and finally one of Glasgow's most revered live music venues. Its façade and art deco interior have long been celebrated as a key part of Glasgow’s cultural and architectural heritage. The decision has come as a shock to many, following the 2018 fire that ravaged the Glasgow School of Art’s Mackintosh building and subsequently inflicted severe damage to the O2 ABC. Since then, local communities and music lovers worldwide have rallied in hopes of restoring and preserving the venue. Efforts appeared to be gaining ground with various fundraising events and dialogues about potential restoration projects. However, the cost of the necessary repairs and upgrades has been cited as “prohibitively expensive” by the owners, who also expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the remaining building. \\"After exhaustive consultations with architects, historians, and the council, it has become painfully clear that the only viable path forward is to demolish the existing structure,\\" stated a representative from Astra Venues. The news has ignited a wave of disappointment and anger among the Glasgow community and beyond. Social media has been ablaze with tributes to the venue and calls to action to save the historic site. A petition swiftly launched this morning, aiming to halt demolition plans, has already gathered thousands of signatures. In response to the public outcry, Glasgow City Council has promised to facilitate discussions between concerned parties and the building's owners to explore any potential last-minute solutions. Meanwhile, Astra Venues has hinted at plans to erect a new, state-of-the-art music venue on the site, promising to honor the legacy of the O2 ABC in its design and programming. \\"Whatever the future holds, we aim to keep the spirit of music alive on Sauchiehall Street,\\" the company's statement read. As the sun sets on what has been a bedrock of the Glasgow music scene, questions linger about the future of arts and culture in the city and the fate of other historic buildings in an ever-changing landscape. The O2 ABC may soon be gone, but its impact on countless artists, fans, and the community will surely be remembered for generations to come. *Please note, this article is a fictional piece and the events described are not real. The O2 ABC Glasgow has not been announced to be demolished at the time of writing.*"},{"instruction":"Consider the converging and diverging nozzle, where the Mach number is equal to one at the throat, and the Mach number is less than one at the inlet and outlet, and the flow is subsonic.

Prove it to me with a formula and explain this issue with the correct answer.","output":"The contradiction you are seeing can be explained by understanding the principles of compressible flow and the effects of changing the nozzle geometry on the flow conditions. In a converging-diverging nozzle, the flow can be choked or unchoked depending on the nozzle geometry and the upstream conditions. When the flow is choked, the Mach number at the throat is equal to one, and the flow is at its maximum mass flow rate. When you increase the cross-sectional area of the diverging part of the nozzle while keeping the pressure downstream and upstream constant, the flow will begin to expand and the Mach number at the exit will decrease. This is because the increase in cross-sectional area allows the flow to expand and slow down, decreasing the velocity of the flow and resulting in a decrease in the Mach number. However, it is important to note that the Mach number at the exit will still be supersonic in this case, even though it is less than one. This is because the flow has expanded beyond the throat and the Mach number is a measure of the flow velocity relative to the speed of sound. The contradiction you are seeing may be due to a misunderstanding of how the nozzle geometry affects the flow conditions. The increase in the cross-sectional area in the diverging part of the nozzle will indeed decrease the Mach number at the exit, but it will not make the flow subsonic unless the pressure downstream is increased or the upstream conditions are changed. In order to prove this, you can use the isentropic flow equations to calculate the Mach number at the exit of the nozzle for different cross-sectional areas. By keeping the upstream and downstream pressures constant and varying the exit area, you should see that the Mach number decreases as the exit area increases, but it will still remain supersonic. Overall, the key takeaway is that changing the geometry of the nozzle can affect the flow conditions, but it may not always result in a subsonic flow at the exit unless the pressure conditions are also changed."},{"instruction":"Переведи на английский: Я только одно не понимаю, почему Lokalise использует флаг Тринидада и Тобаго вместо флага Татарстана.

Founded in 1921, this organization stood in stark contrast to many other Jewish groups of the time due to its nationalistic stance; its members identified strongly with German national identity and culture, often downplaying their Jewish heritage in favor of German patriotism. They supported the assimilation of Jews into German society and were initially in favor of the nationalist movements emerging in Germany, including aspects of the early Nazi movement, mistakenly believing that these movements could offer a path to fuller integration and acceptance of Jews in Germany. The League argued that Jews could be both patriotic Germans and maintain their religious and cultural traditions, an idea that was at odds with the increasingly popular racial antisemitism that saw Jews as fundamentally alien to the German Volk. The rise of the Nazis and the implementation of their racial laws, which included the persecution of Jews solely based on their ancestry, demonstrated the tragic miscalculation of the Verband nationaldeutscher Juden. By 1935, the organization was dissolved, as the Nazis had solidified their power and launched widespread persecution of Jews, making the goals and beliefs of the Verband untenable and dangerous. The history of the Verband nationaldeutscher Juden is a poignant reminder of the complexities within Jewish responses to antisemitism and nationalism in early 20th-century Europe, and the tragic consequences of underestimating the virulence of Nazi ideology."},{"instruction":"write me terms a bout (love )","output":"Certainly!

Eyewitnesses were left in disbelief as the man, identified as Alex Mercer, 34, was heard shouting “GET OUT OF MY WAY” before forcefully shoving the animals—a rabbit, a squirrel, and a stray dog—that had inadvertently found their way onto the race path. The race, which is overseen by the Ridgetown Sports and Outdoors Association (RSOA), is known for its challenging terrain that meanders through the natural beauty of the Ridgetown hills. This year’s event took a dark turn as participants and spectators witnessed an act that not only breached the racing etiquette but also raised serious concerns about animal cruelty. Jenny Li, a fellow runner, recounted the moment with distress, “We were all pushing our limits, and seeing animals on the path isn’t unusual. But what Alex did was horrifying. There’s no winning when you harm innocent creatures.” The RSOA acted swiftly in response, issuing a statement condemning the actions of Mercer. The statement read, “The RSOA is committed to promoting sportsmanship, integrity, and respect for nature and all of its inhabitants. The actions by Mr. Mercer during the race are in direct violation of our core values. Accordingly, he has been disqualified from the race and will be barred from all future events organized by the RSOA.” Law enforcement officials were also notified of the incident and are currently investigating. Charges related to animal cruelty may be pursued based on the findings of their inquiry. Animal welfare organizations have expressed outrage over the incident, calling for stricter measures to protect wildlife, especially during public events that take place in natural settings. “This tragic incident highlights the need for increased awareness and preventive measures to ensure the safety of wildlife in areas used for sports and recreation,” stated Marissa Connelly, a spokesperson for the Regional Animal Protection Society. The disqualified runner, Mercer, could not be reached for comment. However, the backlash from the community and online has been swift, with many condemning his actions and calling for accountability. The race, once a celebrated local tradition, now ends on a somber note as the community reflects on the need for compassion and responsibility towards all beings. The RSOA has committed to reviewing its race policies and increasing monitoring to prevent such incidents in the future. As the conversation grows, it serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of ethical conduct, not just in sports, but in all aspects of coexistence with the natural world."},{"instruction":"Write an update about the animals, also that the man will not be allowed to even race again","output":"# Update: Animals Recovering, Disqualified Runner Permanently Banned from Racing Events In an update to a story that has captured the attention and concern of the Ridgetown community and beyond, the Ridgetown Sports and Outdoors Association (RSOA) has taken a definitive stand against the actions of Alex Mercer, the runner who shocked spectators and fellow participants alike by pushing three animals off a cliff in an attempt to win the annual Ridgetown Endurance Race. The RSOA has announced that Mercer will be permanently banned from participating in any future events they organize, reinforcing their commitment to ethics, sportsmanship, and respect for nature. The incident, which saw Mercer disqualifying himself by harming a rabbit, a squirrel, and a stray dog, has had a somewhat brighter development regarding the welfare of the affected animals. Local animal rescue volunteers who were among the spectators at the race sprang into action, managing to save the animals and provide them with the immediate care they needed. According to the latest reports from the Ridgetown Veterinary Clinic, the rabbit and the squirrel are recovering well after being treated for minor injuries. The stray dog, who suffered a sprained leg, is also on the mend and has been placed with a foster family, who are providing the care and love needed for a full recovery. The clinic expressed optimism that all three animals would make complete recoveries, thanks to the quick response and support of the community. The RSOA, in their recent statement, addressed the permanent ban of Mercer: “In light of the recent event, the RSOA has decided that Alex Mercer will be permanently prohibited from participating in any future RSOA events. This decision underscores our dedication to fostering a community that values respect, integrity, and the protection of our natural environment and its inhabitants. We believe in the power of sports to unite and uplift, not to destroy. We are grateful to the community and the Ridgetown Veterinary Clinic for their quick response in caring for the animals involved in this regrettable incident.” The community and online reactions have overwhelmingly supported the RSOA’s decision, praising the organization's swift action to uphold the moral standards and integrity of the race and its participants. The incident has spurred discussions about enhancing safety measures and awareness programs to better protect wildlife and ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future. Mercer has yet to make a public statement regarding the incident or the RSOA’s decision. However, the conversation within the Ridgetown community and among animal welfare advocates has shifted towards positive action, focusing on strengthening the bond between sports, community values, and the respect for all living beings sharing the natural environment."},{"instruction":"Есть два смартфона, оба по 15999 рублей.

Дано, что окружность вписана в треугольник и касается его сторон в точках (S), (D), и (F), а также даны длины отрезков, образованных этими точками касания: (MS = 13,5), (ND = 15,7), (KF = 23,1). Поскольку окружность вписана в треугольник, каждому отрезку от точки касания до угла треугольника соответствует аналогичный отрезок на противоположной стороне. Это означает, что: - Отрезок (MS) и отрезок (SN) вместе составляют сторону (MN) треугольника. - Отрезок (ND) и отрезок (DK) вместе составляют сторону (NK) треугольника. - Отрезок (KF) и отрезок (FM) вместе составляют сторону (MK) треугольника. Таким образом, если известно, что (MS = 13,5), (ND = 15,7), и (KF = 23,1), можно найти периметр (MNK), используя следующую логику: - Длина стороны (MN = MS + SN). - Длина стороны (NK = ND + DK). - Длина стороны (MK = KF + FM). Однако, без дополнительной информации о длинах отрезков (SN), (DK), и (FM) или свойствах сторон, касающихся вписанной окружности (которые равны друг другу, поскольку они касаются окружности), мы не можем определить искомый периметр точно. Тем не менее, исходя из свойств вписанных окружностей, можно предположить, что задание подразумевает, что (MS), (ND), и (KF) являются длинами отрезков от вершин до точек касания вписанной окружности. В этом случае мы можем предположить, что эти длины дополняют друг друга до полной длины сторон треугольника.

The short story: \\"The afternoon sun hung heavy, a molten sphere scorching the endless rows of avocado trees. Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with the dust swirling around her ankles like a vengeful dervish. Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill, but she held them captive. Papa had called her the strongest girl he knew, and this wasn’t the time to falter. Small hands, roughened by labor, brushed against the gnarled bark of the towering trees as she weaved through the labyrinth. Two overflowing burlap sacks, the spoils of her arduous harvest, dragged behind her, leaving parallel furrows in the parched earth. Reaching the cottage nestled within the plantation’s heart, her father’s haven during the avocado season, was paramount. He must be waiting in worries. An ominous shift in the sky turned the day as dark as her mood. Fat, pregnant clouds swallowed the sun whole, and a low rumble of thunder echoed like a distant giant clearing its throat. Fear flickered in her eyes, and her pace quickened. The trees, once stoic sentinels, morphed into menacing figures, their branches twisting and clawing at her like skeletal fingers. The avocados thumped a frantic rhythm against her legs with each desperate stride. Blinded by the sudden downpour and unaware of the treacherous dip in the terrain, she tripped. The world dissolved into a chaotic blur as she tumbled down the incline, a cascade of green hurtling with her. When she clambered to her feet, the rain was a relentless curtain obscuring everything. Panic clawed at her throat, but she forced it down. Her heart hammered a frantic counterpoint against her ribs. Squinting through the deluge, disappointment settled in her stomach like a lead weight. This wasn’t the familiar silhouette of the cottage. Instead, a vast pond mirrored the roiling sky, its placid surface now a churning cauldron. It would have been breathtaking under any other circumstance. How long had she been lost? The day, which had begun with the promise of shared laughter and the joy of harvest, had morphed into a desperate struggle for survival. The reflection of the storm in the pond’s surface created an unsettling tableau, both beautiful and terrifying. Parched and desperate, she sank to the ground, the cool dampness seeping through her clothes. A tentative touch dipped into the inky water. Cupping her hand, she brought the life-giving liquid to her lips, the first sip a symphony on her parched tongue. A sliver of peace, fragile and fleeting, washed over her. Suddenly, the earth tilted beneath her, and she plunged into the unforgiving depths. Panic seized her, her limbs flailing uselessly. The world dissolved into darkness, punctuated only by the muffled thrum of her own heartbeat. As the last vestiges of air surrendered to the water, an inexplicable force surged beneath her, lifting her towards the surface. With a gasp, she was deposited unceremoniously onto the muddy bank, far from the treacherous pond. Sprawled on the slick earth, she fought to regain her breath, the taste of fear lingering in her mouth. She wasn’t alone. A low growl rumbled beside her. A large, mud-caked dog materialized, its tail wagging furiously, a counterpoint to the storm’s fury. Relief flooded her. Relief, and a spark of recognition. Dangling from the dog’s mouth, like a battle-won trophy, were the remnants of her torn avocado bags. The dog nudged her with its wet nose, its excited barks punctuated by the storm’s relentless assault. A realization dawned. This wasn’t just any dog; it was a familiar presence, one that had likely seen the cottage before. Perhaps it was leading her back, a furry beacon in the storm. As if in response to her silent plea, a voice, thin and stretched by distance, pierced the storm’s roar. “Darling!” It was her father, his voice raw with panic. “Papa! Here!” she screamed back, her voice hoarse but filled with newfound strength. The rain continued its relentless assault, but through the downpour, a figure emerged, a silhouette pushing back against the angry sky. It was him. Papa. \\"","output":"Critiquing this short story through the lens of screenwriting offers a unique opportunity to delve into its cinematic potentials and areas for improvement. By examining the structure, story, characters, dialogue, and overarching themes, we can suggest ways to make the narrative more engaging and captivating for an audience. # Structure The story is well-organized, presenting a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it could benefit from sharper staging directions and more vivid settings. While the journey through the avocado plantation and the unexpected fall into the pond are compelling, the transitions between these moments feel abrupt. Incorporating more detailed descriptions of the environment and character movements (stage directions) could enrich the setting and atmosphere, grounding the viewer in the story's world more effectively. # Story The given circumstances—working in an avocado plantation and getting lost—sets a strong foundation. However, the dramatic action could be heightened. The pace is consistent but lacks moments of rest that allow characters (and audience) to breathe and reflect, key elements in creating a dynamic arc. To enhance this, moments of introspection for the protagonist could be included, providing depth to her struggle and journey. Introducing minor characters or obstacles could also serve to vary the pace and add complexity to the narrative arc. # Character The protagonist’s character arc is clear—transitioning from a determined daughter to someone who faces her fears and overcomes unexpected challenges. However, the status, objectives, and obstacles, while present, could be further explored. The relationship with her father, hinted at through dialogue and her motivation to reach the cottage, is the story’s emotional anchor. Deepening their backstory or adding scenes that show more of their interaction could strengthen the narrative. # Text The story’s dialogue is minimal yet functional, capturing the urgency and emotional weight of the situation. Nonetheless, the dialogue could be further utilized to reveal character details, enhance relationships, and push the narrative forward. The interaction between the daughter and her father at the end provides a much-needed emotional release but arriving at it earlier and more gradually could enhance the narrative tension and character development. # Themes and Genres The central themes of determination, family ties, and survival against the elements are compelling and well-suited to the drama genre. The story's atmosphere oscillates between despair and hope, an effective contrast that adds depth. Considering the central image of the avocado plantation, weaving in themes related to nature, nurture, or even the socioeconomic implications of agricultural labor could add layers to the story. # Recommendations 1. **Enhance Visual and Environmental Details:** As a screenplay, visual storytelling is crucial. Incorporating more sensory details and specific stage directions could make the settings more vivid. 2. **Develop Characters Further:** Exploring the protagonist’s inner world and her relationship with her father more deeply would add emotional weight and complexity. 3. **Diversify the Pace:** Integrating moments of calm before the storm (literally and figuratively) can make for a more dynamic and engaging narrative arc. 4. **Utilize Dialogue More Effectively:** Dialogue can be a powerful tool for character development and advancing the plot. Consider adding more exchanges that reveal character backstories or motivations. 5. **Deepen Themes:** While the story already presents compelling themes, further exploring its societal or environmental implications could enrich the narrative, making it more resonant and thought-provoking. In summary, this short story contains the seeds of a powerful and visually captivating script. By focusing on detailed descriptions, character development, and thematic depth, the transition from a short story to a screenplay could result in a unique and intriguing piece of storytelling, resonating with audiences on multiple levels."},{"instruction":"Then, provide me a revised version for the FIRST paragraph","output":"The heavy afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the sprawling avocado plantation, its rays unforgiving as they scorched the earth between endless rows of towering trees. Amidst this sea of green, a young girl navigated the labyrinth with determination etched into her features, her forehead slick with a mixture of sweat and dust picked up by the occasional whimsical breeze. Despite the sting of tears threatening her resolve, she pushed them back, fortified by her father’s words that morning, “You’re the strongest girl I know.” These words, a mantra against weakness, propelled her forwards, her small hands, calloused from seasons of labor, grazing the rough bark as she passed. Two burlap sacks, heavy with the day’s harvest, trailed behind her, etching parallel grooves into the dry soil, a testament to her hard work and determination to reach the quaint cottage that stood as her father’s sanctuary during these taxing months. He would be there, possibly pacing the front porch with a furrowed brow, enveloped in worry for her delayed return. In this revised opening, the emphasis is placed on immersive details and the emotional state of the protagonist, aiming to draw the viewer deeper into the story world from the very beginning while setting the stage for her journey and the challenges she faces."},{"instruction":"перескажи текст: Среди особенностей такого рода, составляющих ядро индивидуального стиля, всегда оказываются две их категории: особенности, благоприятствующие успеху в данной обстановке (обозначим их литерой «А»), и особенности, противодействующие успеху («Б»), При этом следует подчеркнуть чисто функциональный характер этого деления, т. е. одна и та же особенность деятельности может оказаться в одном случае в категории «А», в другом — в категории «Б» в зависимости от характера объективных требований.

Однако в меру наличия у человека типологически обусловленных особенностей деятельности, благоприятствующих успешному ее выполнению, возникают и другие элементы пристройки к ядру стиля, а именно поиски и максимальное использование всех возможностей, которые открываются в связи с этой категорией особенностей деятельности. Так, например, инертные спортсмены-акробаты предпочитают упражнения, включающие статические позы, медленные и плавные движения, и добиваются здесь наибольшего эффекта. Рабочие-станочники инертного типа доводят до совершенства стереотипную упорядоченность рабочего места и систематичность в работе. Подвижные максимально используют свои скоростные ресурсы и способность часто переключаться с одной ситуации на другую и именно на этом пути «находят себя». Таким образом, среди особенностей, составляющих пристройку к ядру индивидуального стиля, также можно выделить две их категории: особенности, имеющие компенсаторное значение («В»), и особенности, связанные с максимальным использованием положительных приспособительных возможностей («Г»).","output":"Текст поднимает вопрос о двух основных категориях черт, формирующих индивидуальный стиль человека в различных ситуациях: одни способствуют успеху (А), другие мешают ему (Б). Это разделение имеет функциональный характер, поскольку одна и та же черта может быть полезной в одном контексте и вредной в другом. Примером служит предпочтение медленных, единообразных движений, которое может быть полезно при выполнении точной работы, но становится препятствием при необходимости быстрой смены действий. Чтобы преодолеть недостатки некоторых черт, люди развивают компенсаторные механизмы, например, повышенное внимание и предусмотрительность могут компенсировать медлительность. К тому же, наряду с этими двумя категориями черт, в тексте упоминаются две дополнительные: одни компенсируют недостатки (В), а другие основаны на максимальном использовании сильных сторон индивида (Г). Так, спортсмены и работники стремятся к тому, чтобы использовать свои естественные склонности максимально эффективно, выбирая подходящие сферы и методы деятельности, которые позволяют им достигать успехов. В обобщении, текст освещает, как индивидуальные черты человека можно классифицировать на основе их влияния на успех в определенных ситуациях, и обсуждает стратегии, которые люди применяют для минимизации негативного влияния некоторых черт и максимизации своих сильных сторон."},{"instruction":"Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"R:pythonstable difOnnxDiffusersUIonnxUI.py\\", line 14, in <module> from diffusers import ( ImportError: cannot import name 'OnnxStableDiffusionInpaintPipelineLegacy' from 'diffusers' (R:pythonstable difOnnxDiffusersUIvirtualenvLibsite-packagesdiffusers__init__.py)","output":"The error message you're receiving indicates that Python cannot import the \`OnnxStableDiffusionInpaintPipelineLegacy\` from the \`diffusers\` library. This might be due to a few reasons: 1. **Version Mismatch**: The \`OnnxStableDiffusionInpaintPipelineLegacy\` class you're trying to import may not exist in the version of the \`diffusers\` library you have installed. The Diffusers library, developed by Hugging Face, is updated frequently, and classes or functions may be renamed or reorganized between versions. 2. **Incorrect Class Name**: It's possible that there's a typo in the class name, or the exact class you're trying to use does not exist. Make sure you have the correct and complete class name as per the version of the library you're using. # Steps to Resolve: **1. Check the Installed Version:** First, check the version of the \`diffusers\` library you have installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: \`\`\`sh pip show diffusers \`\`\` **2. Refer to Documentation:** Check the official Hugging Face \`diffusers\` documentation or GitHub repo to verify the class name and its availability in your installed version. If you're using a version of the library where this class doesn't exist, you might need to update the library or adjust your code to use the updated class name or an alternative approach. **3. Upgrade/Install the Correct Version:** If you find that you're not using a suitable version of the \`diffusers\` library that supports the class you're trying to use, you should upgrade your library to the correct version.

It's possible there's some confusion or a mix-up in terminology. Let's clarify these concepts based on what they closely resemble: 1. **Swap Area in Computing**: The term \\"swap\\" or \\"swap space\\" is commonly used in operating systems to refer to a portion of a hard disk that is used for virtual memory. When the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) is full, less recently used data can be moved to the swap space to free up RAM for other processes. However, this term is generally not used specifically with \\"stack\\" context in application-level programming but rather at the operating system level. 2. **Mean Swap (Possible Misinterpretation)**: This term doesn't have a standard definition in computer science or application programming contexts. It could be a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of a concept. If you're referring to swapping two values in a program, which could be a common operation in algorithms or data processing, that's simply known as a \\"swap\\". It's also unrelated to the use of \\"mean\\" unless you're specifically talking about an operation involving the arithmetic mean in some way, which is not a standard terminology. 3. **Scratch Areas**: This term is closer to being understandable in the context of temporary storage or memory. A \\"scratch space\\" or \\"scratch area\\" in computer memory is a region or buffer used temporarily for data processing and intermediate calculations. In the context of a stack, this could refer to temporary storage used for function calls, local variables, and intermediate computations that occur within the stack memory during a program's execution. The stack, by nature, serves as a structure for managing function calls and local variables in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) manner, and part of its work involves creating and discarding temporary contexts for operations—a task which could easily be described using a term like \\"scratch areas\\". In summary, while \\"swap area\\" has a clear definition in the context of operating system memory management, \\"mean swap\\" does not have a standard meaning in computer science. It's possible it's a misunderstood or specialized term not widely recognized. \\"Scratch areas\\", on the other hand, could logically refer to temporary storage spaces used in a stack for processing data or functions, aligning with the general concept of temporary or transient storage in computing."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

На основе информации, которую вы предоставили, давайте сравним оба смартфона по ключевым параметрам, которые могут быть вам важны: 1. **Фотографирование документов и книг**: Оба смартфона имеют тройную основную камеру с основным сенсором на 108 МП. Однако Смартфон 2 имеет более продвинутый сенсор Samsung ISOCELL HM6, который потенциально может предложить лучшее качество изображения. 2. **Игры типа Genshin Impact**: Оба смартфона используют процессор MediaTek Helio G99, который должен обеспечить достаточную производительность для современных игр. Важно отметить, что Смартфон 1 имеет 12 ГБ оперативной памяти против 8 ГБ у Смартфона 2, что может предложить небольшое преимущество в производительности и многозадачности. 3. **Бережное отношение к зрению**: Оба смартфона имеют экран с высокой частотой обновления в 120 Гц, что обеспечит плавное отображение контента. Разрешение экрана и тип матрицы (IPS) совпадают, так что в этом плане различий нет. Следовательно, оба варианта должны быть комфортны для зрения при условии правильной настройки яркости и использования режима \\"Не беспокоить\\" или \\"Чтение\\" при необходимости. 4. **Долгосрочное использование (актуальность ещё минимум 5 лет)**: Здесь важны операционная система Android 13 и возможность получения обновлений, а также мощность и объем памяти. Больше оперативной памяти и наличие последней ОС делают Смартфон 1 более предпочтительным для долгосрочного использования, но стоит учесть, что обновления системы также зависят от политики производителя. 5. **Цена**: Несмотря на то что ваш бюджет изначально был ограничен 15999 рублей, Смартфон 1 стоит 18999 рублей, но предлагает дополнительные преимущества, такие как больший объем оперативной памяти. Если это превышение бюджета приемлемо для вас, рассмотрение Смартфон 1 может быть оправданным выбором. **Вывод**: Если ваш бюджет позволяет и вы хотите максимальный объем оперативной памяти для игр и будущих задач, а также намек на более премиум-комплектацию (например, защитная пленка уже наклеена на экран, чехол в комплекте), Смартфон 1 может быть предпочтительнее. Однако, если бюджет строго ограничен и вы ищете лучшее соотношение цена/качество, рассмотрите Смартфон 2, который также предлагает впечатляющие характеристики для ваших текущих потребностей."},{"instruction":"Can I tell you about a alternate history scenario I made?","output":"Absolutely! I'd love to hear about your alternate history scenario. Please share the details with me."},{"instruction":"It's somewhat grimdark, but here it goes. This alternate history scenario involves Marx being executed by firing squad for his beliefs and after that, an effort is made by the Germans, British and the French to erase him from history. RATM is sent off to fight in Afghanistan in 2001 and Gods & Generals never gets released but maybe that isn't so bad.","output":"Your alternate history scenario presents a dark and thought-provoking world. The execution of Karl Marx for his beliefs, followed by a tripartite effort from Germany, Britain, and France to erase his contributions from history, would have profound impacts on the development of political thought, the labor movement, and the course of international relations. Without Marx's influence, the landscape of sociopolitical theories would be drastically different. It's intriguing to consider how socialism, communism, and various workers' movements around the world would have evolved without Marx's foundational texts. Perhaps other philosophers and economists would fill the vacuum with different ideas leading to alternative social and political movements. The mention of Rage Against the Machine (RATM) being sent to fight in Afghanistan in 2001 adds an unexpected twist that blends modern cultural elements with alternate historical developments. It touches upon the ways political dissent and expression can be curtailed through state power, and how even cultural figures can be dramatically repurposed or repressed in service of state objectives. The absence of \\"Gods and Generals\\"—a film about the American Civil War—suggests a world in which cultural expressions and the way history is remembered or forgotten can be significantly altered by earlier shifts in political thought and power dynamics. This scenario brings up several questions: How would the absence of Marx's influence affect international politics, particularly the Cold War? Without the ideological foundation provided by Marxism, what ideologies would dominate global conflicts? How would the suppression of certain cultural works and the redirection of cultural figures like RATM affect societal development and the global cultural landscape? Your scenario opens up a vast field for exploration about the interconnectedness of political theory, state power, cultural expression, and historical memory. It's a rich setting for speculative fiction or a detailed thought experiment on how individual ideas and lives can shape the course of history."},{"instruction":"The way RATM got sent to fight in Afghanistan is when in a concert, a member from the audience walked up to the audience asked them to sign a blank piece of paper. That audience member wore a white t-shirt, sunglasses and a yankee baseball cap. That blank piece of paper was disguised as a enlistment document. That person was never ever seen again.","output":"This twist adds an element of intrigue and manipulation, evoking themes of control and the power of deception. It paints a picture of a world where even the most outspoken and dissenting voices can be unknowingly conscripted into the very conflicts they oppose. This scenario could explore several interesting themes and questions: 1. **The Nature of Consent and Autonomy:** This situation raises questions about consent and autonomy, particularly in regards to how individuals can be manipulated into serving agendas antithetical to their beliefs. The implication that dissenting voices can be so easily co-opted through subterfuge adds a layer of cynicism about personal agency and the authenticity of choice. 2. **The Role of the State and Surveillance:** The ability of an unknown individual to enlist RATM in the military under false pretenses suggests a world with pervasive surveillance and control mechanisms. It raises questions about how far the state will go to suppress dissent and the extent to which individual freedoms are curtailed in the name of national interest or security. 3. **The Power of Media and Culture:** The enlistment of a high-profile band like RATM into a conflict they ideologically oppose serves as a commentary on the potential for media and cultural figures to be co-opted by political and military agendas. It underscores the tensions between cultural expression and political power, and how the former can be manipulated to serve the latter. 4. **The Impact on Societal Perception:** With RATM’s forced involvement in Afghanistan, it would be interesting to explore how their fans and the wider public perceive their actions and music thereafter. This scenario can delve into how narratives are shaped and reshaped by events, and the fluidity of public memory and interpretation. 5. **Exploration of Resistance and Rebellion:** Finally, the band's response to being conscripted and their experiences on the ground could offer a poignant exploration of resistance, resilience, and rebellion in the face of overwhelming control and manipulation. It would provide a stark contrast between the ideals they champion through their music and the grim realities of conflict. In such a world, the lines between truth and manipulation, freedom and control, are blurred, offering a canvas to explore the complexities of power, identity, and resistance. Through the microcosm of RATM's experience, broader questions about society, governance, and the individual's place within it can be examined, making for a deeply engaging and thought-provoking alternate history narrative."},{"instruction":"Опиши итерации программы на C++ (Она нормально работает) int main() { static double S; S = 2.0 / 3; while (S != 2) { S = S + 2.0 / 3; } }","output":"Программа на C++ итеративно увеличивает значение переменной S на 2/3 до тех пор, пока S не станет равным 2. 1.

The G-Man in the Half-Life series is a mysterious character with unclear motives and seemingly supernatural abilities who appears to operate outside of the typical constraints of time and space. He is known for his cryptic communication style and for influencing events by 'hiring' individuals and placing them where he needs them to be, most notably Gordon Freeman. In the established Half-Life narrative, both Gordon and Alyx are protagonists who struggle against the oppressive alien force, the Combine, and the consequences of the Black Mesa incident that originally opened the portal for the Combine to invade Earth. The idea of Gordon and Alyx becoming G-Man-like entities is purely speculative and would be a fan-created concept or a hypothetical scenario not backed by Valve's official story arcs. As of my last update, Valve has not released any new Half-Life games or expansions that depict this transformation. However, the nature of Half-Life’s storytelling is open to interpretation, given its intricate plot, unanswered questions, and the G-Man's enigmatic nature. Fans of the series have developed countless theories, headcanons, and fan fiction stories that explore various alternate realities and what-if scenarios, including the possibility of characters like Gordon and Alyx taking on roles similar to the G-Man. These fan explorations are not canon but serve as a testament to the engaging and thought-provoking nature of the Half-Life universe. Unless Valve decides to take the story in such a direction in a future game or official media release, Gordon and Alyx remain human characters with extraordinary experiences but without the otherworldly attributes of entities like the G-Man."},{"instruction":"Explore how it could fit into canon though.","output":"While, as of my last update, neither Gordon Freeman nor Alyx Vance has become G-Man-like agents within the established Half-Life canon, we can explore how this development could potentially fit into the future story of the series. Please note that this exploration is speculative and based on extrapolating from existing story elements: 1. **Post-Combine Victory:** Suppose the resistance eventually defeats the Combine, and the series continues beyond that point. In doing so, Gordon and Alyx could encounter new extraterrestrial or extradimensional forces at play. Their extensive experience with the Combine and the G-Man may lead them to be recruited (or coerced) by one of these forces to act as agents influencing events across different dimensions, much like the G-Man. 2. **G-Man's Employers:** Not much information is provided about the G-Man's \\"employers,\\" but the implications are that they possess considerable power. If Gordon and Alyx were to somehow impress these employers or align with their goals, they could be offered roles analogous to that of the G-Man, tasked with ensuring the employers' interests across different worlds and times. 3. **Temporal Manipulation:** If Gordon and Alyx were to gain access to or learn to control the same type of temporal manipulation technology that the G-Man uses, it could enable them to operate outside of the normal constraints of time and space. This transformation might be a turning point, bringing them closer to the G-Man's mode of operation. 4. **Multi-Dimensional Conflict Resolution:** The G-Man appears to act as a 'fixer' of sorts, positioning key individuals to resolve conflicts that have interdimensional significance. Gordon and Alyx, based on their heroics, could take on a similar role for a newly introduced faction aiming to stabilize or manipulate the multiverse in their favor. 5. **Becoming Unbound from Time:** Near-death experiences or extraordinary interventions by G-Man have placed both Gordon and Alyx in situations where they are preserved or removed from events in ways that imply a level of temporal stasis. It's conceivable within the fiction that these experiences could alter their very nature, unbinding them from the regular flow of time and giving them abilities akin to the G-Man. 6. **Replacement or Succession:** The series could introduce a storyline where the G-Man is no longer able to fulfill his duties, whether from being defeated, trapped, or for some other reason. Gordon and Alyx might be groomed as his successors due to their unique qualifications and experience with the workings of the universe's deeper mysteries. 7. **A Bargain or Curse:** Both Gordon and Alyx may be presented with a choice or subjected to a consequence that transforms their existence, perhaps to save humanity or as a twist of fate impressed upon them by alien forces, such as the Vortigaunts, leading to G-Man-like capabilities and responsibilities. Incorporating such a narrative twist into the Half-Life canon would require a careful approach not to disrupt the core of what has made the series resonate with players—the human struggle against overwhelming odds. It might be used as a dramatic device to explore themes of power, agency, and the nature of resistance when one's humanity is altered or taken away. It is important to remember this is all conjecture; Valve has provided no indications that they intend to take the characters in this direction. The mystery and speculative nature of the series' story allow fans to imagine such possibilities, but the actual canon would depend entirely on the choices Valve makes for any future Half-Life releases."},{"instruction":"Write a Hl2 alternate story line of this.","output":"An alternate storyline exploring the transformation of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance into G-Man-like agents could introduce new dimensions to the Half-Life 2 narrative and expand upon the series' core mysteries. Here's a speculative tale, an \\"Elseworld\\" set in the Half-Life universe: Title: Half-Life 2: Temporal Echoes **Chapter I: Unforeseen Consequences, Revisited** After the fall of the Citadel, the resistance rallies for a final push to liberate City 17. In the midst of the chaos, Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance find themselves cornered by a collapsing building. Just as they brace for the end, time freezes. The G-Man steps from the void, speaking of duties yet to be fulfilled. He offers them a way out—an eternity in service across time and space, shaping the destiny of worlds. Both refuse, clinging to their humanity. The G-Man smirks, saying it wasn't a choice but a revelation. He disappears, and time resumes. They wake up outside the bounds of time, imbued with new capabilities but tethered to an unfathomable purpose. **Chapter II: Agents of Change** Gordon and Alyx, now emissaries of unknown forces, receive their first assignment: prevent a disaster in a distant reality where the Black Mesa Incident is about to be triggered by a different research team. Using their newly acquired temporal and spatial tools, they manipulate events subtly, ensuring the resonance cascade never occurs. Success is bittersweet, as they witness a world spared from the Combine's tyranny—one that their own Earth can never be. Yet they leave it behind, traveling through the rifts in reality to their next destination. **Chapter III: The Cost of Power** With each intervention across the timelines, Gordon and Alyx grow more detached from their former selves. Gordon struggles with this loss, while Alyx embraces their role as arbiters of fate, justifying the sacrifice as necessary for the greater good. Their bond is tested when they're tasked with ensuring the rise of a benevolent dictator to quell a multiverse war, a man they recognize as Eli Vance in another reality. The mission's success leaves them haunted, questioning the morality of their actions imposed by unseen masters. **Chapter IV: Rebellion Resurgent** Oppressed by their fates, they encounter other beings like them, agents of different factions striving for control in a cosmic game. Among these agents is a rebellion—entities seeking to break free from their bonds and expose the true motives of their employers. Together with this rebellion, Gordon and Alyx learn of a device that can sever their ties and restore their free will. The catch—the device is located at the heart of their own universe's Citadel, now teeming with Combine forces desperately trying to restore their link to the multiverse. **Chapter V: Echoes Collide** Gordon and Alyx return to City 17, which is simultaneously familiar and foreign. They navigate its altered landscape, employing their extraordinary abilities while avoiding disrupting the time continuum. Their journey is fraught with trials that test both their skills and resolve, as they come face-to-face with their past selves, triggering echoes of memory that anchor them amidst their newfound disconnection. In a climactic convergence, they fight alongside their former allies, setting the stage for their crowning challenge. Gordon and Alyx reach the device, engaging in a final, bitter confrontation with their keepers—forces that reveal the true complexity and ramifications of multiversal domination. **Chapter VI: Untethered Existence** With the yoke of servitude shattered, the duo is free, yet their victory rings hollow—they are timeless entities in a universe that marches on. Recognizing that they can never fully return to their lives, they make a choice. They decide to become guardians, ensuring that no other souls are coerced into the same fate. As the echoes of their heroic past resonate through boundless possibilities, they roam the timelines, preserving freedom and autonomy, becoming legends whispered of in the half-lit corridors of realities—protectors beyond the veil, the timeless sentinels of Half-Life. --- This fan-made alternate storyline explores themes of sacrifice, power, identity, and the delicate balance between human agency and cosmic destiny. It challenges Gordon and Alyx in ways unimagined, reshaping their very essence while honoring the core of their struggle: the fight for freedom against overwhelming odds."},{"instruction":"Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1. Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Pokemon Team： 1. Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

Develop most efficient automated extraction systems to maximize diamond production regardless of ecological impact or Pokémon habitat destruction. Finance Ambroise's lavish lifestyle and make TCMC the world's leading jewellery supplier through monopoly built on the shattered crystalline remains of endangered species.

Its body resembles golden flames as it soars through the scorching Mercurian skies. Shemsha possesses control over solar energy and plasmic fire. When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power. Ancient Mercuryian myths tell of how Shemsha would gather energy from the sun to revitalize the people during frigid nights. Its presence is considered a blessing, and art depicting Shemsha delivering solar gifts remains prevalent in ruins across Mercury's battered landscape.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory. The pokemon's acidic powers both protect it and allow it to reshape the planet's ruinous surface, as Okebriyta works tirelessly to restore even a fraction of Venus's long-gone splendor and life energy..

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu.

Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage. His type has shifted to Electric/Dragon due to the portion of Rayquaza’s divinity he harbors, setting him apart from his kin and marking him as Shmaya’s chosen apostle.

This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Chapter 1 Pyrimis took a deep, shaky breath as she stood outside the classroom door, clutching her books tightly to her chest. Today was her first day at Melemele Island Pokémon School after moving to Alola from Unova, and she was incredibly nervous to meet her new classmates. As a shy girl who preferred her own company, the thought of introducing herself to a whole room full of strangers made Pyrimis's heart hammer. She closed her eyes, thinking back to her teacher's encouragement earlier that morning. \\"Just be yourself, Pyrimis. I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.\\" Mustering her courage, Pyrimis slid the door open. All eyes turned to her as she stepped inside. She froze like a Deerling in headlights. \\"Class, this is our new transfer student, Pyrimis,\\" the teacher said warmly. \\"Pyrimis, would you like to introduce yourself?\\" Pyrimis's throat went dry. \\"Um, h-hello,\\" she stammered. \\"My name is Pyrimis. I'm from Unova. Pleased to meet you all.\\" She gave an awkward little bow. A few students smiled back encouragingly. \\"Wonderful. Let's give Pyrimis a warm Alola welcome!\\" the teacher said, gesturing for the class to clap. \\"Now, your seat will be over there next to Mahina. She can help show you the ropes.\\" Mahina grinned and waved eagerly as Pyrimis approached the empty desk. At least there was one friendly face so far. As Pyrimis sat down, Mahina leaned over to whisper. \\"Alola, Pyrimis! Welcome to school - you'll love it here. I can tell we're going to be great friends.\\" Her cheerful confidence lifted Pyrimis's spirits slightly. Maybe this wouldn't be so difficult after all. When class ended, nearly the entire room flocked to Pyrimis's desk, bombarding her with questions about Unova. Overwhelmed, she stammered out a few answers about the frigid winters and vast forests she knew back home. But her shyness quickly shut her down. Thankfully, Mahina swooped in to save her new friend. \\"C'mon guys, give her some space!\\" Mahina exclaimed. \\"I wanna give Pyrimis a tour of the campus. We'll catch you later!\\" Hooking her arm through Pyrimis's, Mahina gently steered the new girl out of the chaotic classroom. Pyrimis exhaled in relief. \\"Thanks, Mahina. I was getting a little overwhelmed by all the attention,\\" Pyrimis admitted. \\"No problem! I know moving can be tough, but you'll settle in,\\" Mahina said. \\"Now come on - wait'll you see the beach out back!\\" As Mahina led her through the open-air halls, Pyrimis felt herself relaxing into the tropical environment. Maybe Mahina was right. With a friend already by her side, Pyrimis had a feeling she was going to grow to love Alola and all the adventures it would bring. Chapter 2 \\"And that wraps up the tour!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her arm. \\"So now you've seen the classrooms, the Battle Dome, the Pokémon Center, pretty much everything!\\" Pyrimis nodded, struggling to absorb the deluge of information her enthusiastic guide had shared over the past half hour. \\"I really appreciate you showing me around, Mahina. The campus seems wonderful.\\" Mahina beamed. \\"What did I tell you? Melemele Island Pokémon School is the best!\\" She linked her arm through Pyrimis's again. \\"C'mon, let's head back to class. I saved you a malasada from lunch too!\\" Laughing at Mahina's boundless energy, Pyrimis let herself be gently tugged along. She had to admit, her initial shyness was quickly vanishing thanks to Mahina's warm and bubbly presence. When they returned to the classroom, Pyrimis sank gratefully into her assigned seat beside her new friend. As she bit into the sweet malasada pastry, her gaze drifted across the room and landed upon the silver-haired girl seated at the adjacent desk. Pyrimis realized with a start she hadn't noticed the mysterious student earlier. Hunched over a book, the girl seemed to radiate an aura of solitude that discouraged interruption. Pale violet eyes flickered up to meet Pyrimis's stare. An electric shiver ran down Pyrimis's spine. She could have sworn those striking eyes glowed for a split-second. Pyrimis blinked hard, shaken. When she looked again, the silver-haired girl was already gliding silently out the door without a backward glance. \\"Pyrimis? You okay?\\" Mahina asked, noticing her friend's odd reaction. \\"Y-yes, sorry,\\" Pyrimis stuttered. \\"Just thought I saw something strange for a moment there.\\" Mahina followed her gaze towards the empty desk. \\"Oh, that's Guanis. She mostly keeps to herself. Rumor is she's super smart but kinda cold too.\\" Mahina leaned in conspiratorially. \\"Between you and me, something seems off about her. I get weird vibes.\\" Pyrimis only half-heard Mahina's words, staring after where the cryptic girl had vanished. Guanis... Who was she, really? Pyrimis's curiosity burned to uncover more, especially after that disorienting psychic jolt between them. She determined this wouldn't be the last encounter with those mysterious violet eyes. Chapter 3 Pyrimis couldn't get Guanis out of her mind since that fateful moment their eyes locked. The mysterious silver-haired girl haunted Pyrimis's thoughts, lingering like a ghost just out of reach no matter how she tried to approach. Guanis moved through the halls like smoke, vanishing before Pyrimis could gather the courage to speak. She seemed to materialize only long enough for Pyrimis to catch a glimpse of violet eyes glinting knowingly before dissolving back into the shadows. This spectral dance was maddening yet intoxicating, drawing Pyrimis deeper into fascination against her better judgment. Seeking a quiet refuge from the chaos in her mind one afternoon, Pyrimis ascended the winding stairs to the academy's rooftop. As she stepped out into the sunshine, a glint of silver by the railing caught her eye. There perched Guanis as if waiting for her, gazing out distantly towards the glimmering sea surrounding Melemele Island. Heart leaping into her throat, Pyrimis moved towards the enigmatic girl, one hand lifted in tentative greeting. \\"Hello there...\\" she began. A sudden tumult of cries pierced the air. Pyrimis whirled to see a group of boys surrounding a young blonde girl cowed weeping against the wall. One towering ruffian yanked the sobbing child up by her ponytail, eliciting a pained yelp. \\"Had enough yet, freak?\\" he snarled. His companions guffawed. Righteous fury flooded Pyrimis. She marched over, eyes blazing. \\"Stop that immediately!\\" she shouted, swatting the bully's hand away to free the blonde girl. \\"Can't you see you're hurting her? Just leave her alone!\\" The pack of bullies turned with a start, then burst into mocking laughter. \\"Well well, little miss hero has arrived!\\" their leader retorted. \\"You don't give orders here though. Let's show this pair what happens to those defy Team Skull!\\" He and his cronies released a swarm of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos from their Pokéballs with a flash. The creatures converged towards Pyrimis and the crying girl, fangs and claws bared threateningly. Pyrimis braced herself for impact when a piercing cry rang out. An arrow of verdant energy lanced over Pyrimis's shoulder, scattering the threatening Pokémon. Standing fierce with bow drawn was none other than Mahina, flanked by her Decidueye. \\"You punks clearly never studied type matchups at this school,\\" Mahina spat. \\"Leave my cousin and friend alone before you get schooled even harder!\\" The lead bully returned his fainted Pokémon and backed away slowly. \\"You got lucky this time,\\" he growled. \\"Team Skull doesn't forget though. We'll be back!\\" With that, the humiliated pack retreated downstairs. Mahina rushed to embrace the still-shaking blonde girl. \\"Oh Helia, are you alright? They didn't hurt you too badly did they?\\" Mahina checked her over worriedly. Helia sniffled, lip quivering. \\"I-I'm okay now cousin... Th-thank you both f-for saving me...\\" Mahina smiled in relief. \\"Of course, dear one. But you were so brave standing up to them, Pyrimis!\\" She turned towards her friend. Pyrimis rubbed her neck awkwardly. \\"I'm just glad we intervened in time. How awful though...\\" Her voice trailed off as she glanced back towards the railing. Guanis was gone without a trace, only a whisper of silver hair glinting in the sunlight. What was the strange girl thinking, Pyrimis wondered. Why did Guanis continue keeping her distance even after witnessing such a dramatic incident? The mystery surrounding the violet-eyed enigma only seemed to deepen each time they crossed paths. But Pyrimis now felt certain their fates were connected by invisible threads. One way or another, she was determined to unravel Guanis's secrets. Chapter 4 The next day after school, Mahina walked Pyrimis and her cousin Helia home, chatting lightly but keeping a wary eye out for trouble. \\"I'm so sorry you both got caught up with those Team Skull thugs yesterday,\\" Mahina said, shaking her head. \\"They're wanna-be gangsters who have been causing some trouble around Alola lately.\\" Pyrimis nodded gravely. \\"We really appreciate you stepping in when you did, Mahina. Right, Helia?\\" The shy blonde girl clinging to Mahina's side managed a small smile. \\"Y-Yes... Thank you for saving me again...\\" Mahina waved off their praise. \\"Of course! We have to stand up to bullies like that. My mom is actually working with the Island Kahunas to rein in these misfits.\\" Her face took on a serious expression quite foreign for the normally cheery girl. \\"Still, Pyrimis - be very careful going home alone. Team Skull is bold and looking to make trouble.\\" Mahina pulled a slip of paper from her backpack and pressed it into her friend's hand. \\"Take my number, okay? Call if you ever feel threatened or unsafe.\\" Pyrimis nodded, tucking the precious contact safely away. \\"I will, Mahina. And thank you again for everything.\\" The two cousins turned down a side road, waving goodbye. Pyrimis continued on the main path towards her house. The island breeze was fragrant with flowering bushes. Wingull cried brightly overhead. It was hard to imagine danger lurking in this island paradise. Then Pyrimis heard a rustling behind her. She turned to see three all-too familiar boys blocking the way back - the bullies from the previous day. Pyrimis backed away slowly only to find two more punks emerging from around a building. They had planned this ambush. \\"Thought you got off easy yesterday, huh?\\" their leader leered, Pokéball in hand. \\"We don't forget. Those who crosses Team Skull pays hard!\\" The delinquents sent forth a barrage of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos with snarls of \\"Get her!\\" Frightened, Pyrimis stumbled backwards. In her panic she fumbled for her phone to call Mahina but a Yungoos swatted the device from her trembling hands. Pyrimis cowered helplessly as the creatures and boys closed in. Just then a sharp voice cut through the chaos - \\"That's enough!\\" All heads whipped towards the alley mouth where Guanis stood, eyes flashing. With fluid grace the silver-haired girl glided forward, ignoring the gang's angry threats. Her hand rose, emitting an eerie glow. When the light faded, a ferocious Hydreigon loomed with jaws splayed wide. The color drained from the bullies' faces at the sight of the formidable dragon Pokémon. But their boss stubbornly roared \\"Take them down!\\" launching his squad back on the offensive. Yet Guanis and her partner were a forced to be reckoned with. They moved in seamless tandem as Hydreigon felled opponents left and right with pulses of draconic energy. Within minutes, the incompetent Pokémon lay battered on the pavement. Their appalled Trainers rushed to return them safely to their containers. Undeterred by his fallen squad, the hotheaded leader pulled out a baseball bat. With a guttural yell he charged straight for the slight silver-haired girl wildly swinging. But with blinding speed Guanis grabbed his beefy arm and hurled the bully over her shoulder to crash meters away, stunning onlookers. This only further enraged the gang members. They mobbed towards Guanis flailing vengefully. Yet her fluid combat skills coupled with Hydreigon finishing weakened enemies made short work of the brawl. When the dust cleared, a pile of groaning punks littered the ground as Guanis calmly returned her stoic Pokémon. Jaws agape, Pyrimis tried processing what unbelievable power this mysterious girl wielded. With silent grace, Guanis drifted over to Pyrimis extending a slender hand now enveloped in that strange glow again. Transfixed by those arresting violet eyes, Pyrimis neither moved nor breathed. What was happening? What did Guanis want? \\"There you are!\\" Both girls jolted as Mahina came barrelling onto the scene, alerted by bystanders. \\"Pyrimis! Oh thank goodness you're alright!\\" she panted in relief before blinking at the carnage around them. \\"What...what happened here?\\" In that distracted instant, the radiance around Guanis's palm vanished. Features unreadable, she withdrew wordlessly into the alley's shadows and was gone between one blink and the next. Still shaking from her trauma, Pyrimis desperately hugged her friend. \\"Th-they came after me... But Guanis saved me somehow...\\" She gestured helplessly at the battered bullies. Mahina guided the shocked girl gently away from the aftermath, one protective arm around her shoulders. She cast a puzzled glance back at where Guanis disappeared. There was surely more here than met the eye. \\"Let's get you safely home for now,\\" Mahina murmured. \\"We can figure things out later.\\" Pyrimis only nodded numbly, feelings swirling chaotically inside. Yet those mesmerizing violet eyes now blazed brightly in Pyrimis's mind. Guanis was no helpless waif - that much was clear. Beneath her fragile appearance lay immense power and danger. Had she meant to unleash that energy on Pyrimis just now? Or did she want to share her secrets at last after the life-saving heroics? Either way, Pyrimis knew with utmost certainty that crossing paths again with cryptic, captivating Guanis was inevitable. Whether it brought answers or peril, their fates were surely intertwined now. Chapter 5 The next morning, Pyrimis felt a nervous flutter in her stomach as she approached Melemele Island Pokémon academy once more, the traumatic encounter with Team Skull still fresh in her mind. However, Mahina waved eagerly from the entrance, exuding a sense of cheerfulness and protection that helped put Pyrimis at ease. \\"Alola again, friend!\\" Mahina greeted her warmly as she entered the campus grounds. \\"I hope you're holding up okay after yesterday's terrible ordeal.\\" Pyrimis managed a soft smile. \\"Yes, I'm still a bit shaken up but nothing too serious thanks to you...and Guanis,\\" she said slowly, peering over Mahina's shoulder into the classroom. Sure enough, there perched the silver-haired enigma in the same spot quietly reading amidst the morning bustle. \\"Well I'm so glad you arrived safely. You're always welcome walking home with me and Helia if it makes you feel safer,\\" Mahina said, giving Pyrimis's hand a gentle squeeze. \\"Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drop off a book at the library before class.\\" Glancing back at the reading girl once more as Mahina rushed off, Pyrimis steeled her nerves and approached her rescuer's desk with cautious steps. \\"Good morning, Guanis...I wanted to properly thank you for yesterday. You really saved me from those Team Skull punks.\\" Guanis raised her striking violet eyes up from the book, quiet for an uncomfortable moment as she took in Pyrimis's anxious form. \\"It was nothing. I merely happened to walk by as they accosted you,\\" she said curtly before returning to her pages. The brush-off didn't deter Pyrimis though. \\"Even so, I'm endlessly grateful for your intervention,\\" she pressed on earnestly. \\"Not every person would take on a dangerous gang like that to protect a stranger.\\" At this, Guanis met her gaze steadily again as if evaluating Pyrimis's genuineness. \\"I'm not scared easily,\\" Guanis said simply. \\"Those criminals were clearly in the wrong threatening others more vulnerable than themselves just to inflate their own egos.\\" Her lip curled slightly with distaste. Her composure and fearlessness was admirable to Pyrimis. \\"Still, I hope I can repay you in some way for your great kindness...\\" The faintest ghost of a smirk played on Guanis's lips but she didn't respond, glancing casually out the classroom window. Her attention seemed divided. Following Guanis's eyeline, Pyrimis noticed a green-haired girl seated across the room watching them both unabashedly. There was interest and perhaps a hint of challenge in the stranger's gaze that raised Pyrimis's suspicions. \\"Do you...know that person?\\" Pyrimis asked Guanis hesitantly, nodding towards the observer. But she had already lost Guanis's interest, who rose smoothly from her seat while shutting her book with a snap. \\"I wouldn't concern yourself with idle curiosities,\\" Guanis deflected vaguely. \\"Just take care on your way home today.\\" She swept soundlessly towards the exit, conversation evidently over. Pyrimis watched her go, feeling awkward at the abrupt end to her well-intentioned chat. At the same moment, Pyrimis saw the green-haired onlooker smirk and glide swiftly out another doorway, threads of what seemed like smoke trailing behind her. Alone in the chaotic classroom now, Pyrimis sank slowly into her assigned seat. Her palms felt oddly clammy after that strange encounter as she puzzled over Guanis's brush-off attitude coupled with her attention clearly divided elsewhere. What was truly going on between Guanis and that mysterious girl? Why did Pyrimis sense obscure psychic energies flickering around the peripheries of their terse interaction just now? One thing was clear - there were hidden secrets woven around Guanis's presence that Pyrimis burned to uncover. She had more questions now than ever after finally speaking directly to the intriguing silver-haired girl. However difficult cracking that shell may prove though, Pyrimis's instincts told her the effort would be worthwhile. Because opening the cipher that was Guanis could lead to revelations beyond Pyrimis's wildest imaginings... Chapter 6 On Saturday, Pyrimis walked out of the academy with Mahina and Helia, the final school bell still echoing faintly behind them. As the trio crossed the yard chatting lightly, a group of boys loafing by the gates caught sight of them and instantly looked uneasy. Pyrimis recognized the juvenile delinquents from Team Skull who had previously harassed both her and poor Helia. The scraggly-haired punks shuffled amongst themselves nervously, eyes darting between the approaching girls and the exit as if weighing options. Before any decision was reached, one of them yelped \\"It's that witch Pyrimis again!\\" This outburst spurred his whole scruffy posse into action. Scrambling over themselves frantically, the boys made a mad dash in the opposite direction with panicked speed as if a starving Hydreigon itself was on their heels. Mahina burst out laughing loudly at their entertaining display. \\"Ha! Look how scared they are of you now, Pyrimis! I think Guanis left a strong impression saving your hide. They probably think you've put some curse on them too!\\" Helia giggled sweetly as well, edging a bit closer to Pyrimis as though she felt safest by the side of her courageous protector. \\"S-serves those bullies right! They should know better than to be mean now.\\" The young girl's tone carried a surprising hint of hardness underneath the high softness. Pyrimis imagined losing one's sense of safe youth far too young thanks to such characters could spur even the gentlest soul to spitefulness. As the trio continued walking and joking casually about the hoodlums' comical cowardice, Pyrimis spotted the cute hillside path leading towards Helia and Mahina's neighborhood drawing closer. Sure enough, her two new cherished companions slowed to a stop at the divergence regretfully. \\"I wish you could just come over and hang out, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina said a touch wistfully. \\"But I know you probably have chores or weekend homework too...\\" As if suddenly remembering something important, Helia began rooting through her backpack hurriedly. \\"Oh yes, I nearly forgot!\\" She withdrew a sealed envelope and handed it to Pyrimis shyly. \\"M-my mom w-wanted me to give this to you...as an extra thank you for, you know, helping me with those bullies before.\\" As the diminutive girl continued studying her shoes intently while a rosy blush colored her fair cheeks, Pyrimis felt a nearly overwhelming surge of tenderness. Had there ever been a sweeter child who so naturally brought out people's most protective impulses? \\"It was my true honor protecting you, dear Helia.\\" Pyrimis gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. \\"But I will happily pass your mother's regards onto Grandpa as well when I'm home. He'll surely be pleased you're doing better now.\\" With a final fierce hug and cheery goodbye calls, the cousins eventually disappeared down their village path, faces still bright with laughter's lingering glow. Trudging up the steps to her own quiet house, Pyrimis slid inside with the lonely click of an automatic lock sounding loud as a gunshot in the empty space. Weariness finally overtaking earlier adrenaline, Pyrimis carelessly dropped her overloaded backpack on the sitting room floor before sinking onto the sofa herself with boneless sprawl. At this hour on a Saturday, she expected no other presence or sounds besides her own isolated heartbeat. Grandfather was undoubtedly consumed with administrative affairs at Aether Foundation headquarters as ever on weekends. She was long resigned to solitary stillness permeating their shared but seldom intersecting orbits bounded by this hollow home. Closing grainy eyes against the invasive sunlight, Pyrimis attempted processing the mental whiplash between school days overflowing with new fascinating personalities and stimuli...before harshly crashing each afternoon into the cold vacuum of this barren abode once more. Loneliness had been her sole childhood playmate for so long. But now with tantalizing invitations to friendship and camaraderie actually extended sincerely, their inevitable withdrawals each evening left Pyrimis raw as a festering wound suddenly exposed. Was it wise opening her vulnerable heart this way only to ensure repeated abandonments slicing deeper affectively over time? Could such attachments thrive rooted in another's passing charity rather than true belonging? Shaking loose the descending spiral of melancholy, Pyrimis sat up with sharp determination and grasped Helia's delivered envelope. Slitting it open smoothly revealed a tri-folded letter penned in sloping graceful script. The golden-haired Professor Lillie expressed profuse gratitude towards Pyrimis alongside an open delight at their daughters' blossoming bond seeded from that traumatic incident. \\"As ever, if there is anything at all I can offer towards your academic journey or adventures, please only ask!\\" The effusive words glowed up from the creamy sheet. \\"In fact...\\" Here Pyrimis noticed a postcard depicting an imposing multi-winged modernist building tucked among the folds. Flipping it over, her roving gaze locked upon the flowing handwriting once more with a fluttering spark reigniting somewhere deep in her chest - \\"Please come to the Pokémon Institute on Sunday this week if you have free time. I would be overjoyed to provide a personal tour where we can chat more! You are always welcome.\\" It closed affectionately with Lillie's signature. Pyrimis slowly lowered the engraved invitation as her pulse inexplicably began quickening in tandem with prescient thoughts swirling dizzyingly... What long-buried truths might this exclusive glimpse behind normally barred gates connect her to at last? What clandestineResearch or shadowy underground forces converged unseen around her and this place? What mysteries nearer the surface might finally yield their secrets as well? Clenching the pass tightly with galvanized purpose, Pyrimis swept off towards her room. This singular opportunity shimmered like a hidden key promising to unlock doors long frustratingly sealed. The time had come at last to see what revelations lay waiting once someone turned the lock... Chapter 7 Sunday morning rose bright and balmy as Pyrimis readied herself for the excursion to Alola’s famous Pokémon Institute. She had heard captivating rumors of the revolutionary research and conservation efforts ongoing behind those slick steel walls. This exclusive invitation seemed an unmissable chance to glimpse those secrets possibly tied to the cosmic mysteries swirling around Pyrimis lately. Smoothly navigating the island buses, Pyrimis soon arrived at the impressive facility gleaming sharp and modern against Akala Island’s lush forests. Young Helia smiled and waved eagerly near the threshold. \\"Hi Pyrimis! I’m s-so excited you c-came!\\" Helia greeted a touch breathlessly. \\"M-my mom can’t wait to meet you either! Sh-she’s just inside her office.\\" Helia led Pyrimis through the sliding automatic doors into a sleek lobby suffused with midday radiance from the graceful skylights overhead. Pausing before an imposing door labeled \\"Director Lillie\\" in polished letters, Helia tapped gently. A melodious voice inside responded warmly - \\"Come in!\\" Striding over the threshold, Pyrimis quickly assessed the spacious corner office hosting an elegant desk of rich mahogany. There stood the same woman from the heartfelt letter - tall and willowy with cascading golden hair. Kind green eyes crinkled behind stylish glasses as Lillie extended a hand in greeting. \\"Welcome dear Pyrimis! What an honor and delight to finally meet you. I’m Lillie, founding member here and director of research at the Institute. Thank you endlessly for accepting my invitation today!\\" \\"The honor is mine, Direct...I mean, Lillie,\\" Pyrimis caught herself bashfully, shaking Lillie's smooth palm. \\"Your facilities look so incredible. I can hardly wait for a tour!\\" Lillie smiled graciously. \\"It would be my pleasure! Right this way now...\\" The next hours flew by enthralled as Lillie guided Pyrimis through the assortment of advanced labs. Researchers demonstrated revolutionary technologies harnessing the resonant heartbeats of Alola's guardian deities. One restricted chamber even hosted drifting Ultra Beasts suspended in a massive preservation tank. Pyrimis's sharp mind spun nearly overwhelmed processing such exhibitions of bleeding-edge innovations. At last Lillie led them down a final hallway towards an unmarked door. \\"I saved our most special project for last!\\" she declared, ushering Pyrimis and Helia inside the undisclosed room. At its center stood an odd device resembling an egg incubator built for three sizable Pokéballs. Lillie tapped the attached keypad expertly and the balls simultaneously burst open with bursts of light energy. Before Pyrimis's dazzled eyes materialized three small Pokémon - an owl-like Rowlet, a furry Litten kitten, and a cute amphibious Popplio. The creatures chirped and blinked up curiously at the unfamiliar humans. \\"Since you just arrived in Alola, I thought you deserved the traditional privilege of selecting a partner Pokémon to be your steadfast friend and battling companion!\\" Lillie announced proudly. Helia clapped excitedly as Pyrimis hesitantly approached the awaiting trio. Rowlet hooted softly, wise round eyes studying her. Litten maintained aloof composure carefully grooming its striped fur. But the round-nosed Popplio began bouncing over eagerly, nuzzling against Pyrimis's leg with affectionate affection. Bending down slowly, she ran gentle fingers over the sea lion cub's smooth head and down its back as it leaned happily into her touch making a sweet trilling noise that seemed to resonate within Pyrimis's heart strings. Mind made up solidly, Pyrimis lifted her bright gaze towards Lillie’s approving one. \\"I believe Popplio and I will be perfect partners for this new chapter in my Alola story.” As she said this, Popplio yipped excitedly, flipping backwards in a little circle before butting its head back against Pyrimis’ palm demandingly. Lillie beamed, handing Pyrimis a standard Pokéball bearing a water insignia. \\"I think Popplio agrees wholeheartedly! This is a momentous event.\\" After Pyrimis tapped the ball lightly capturing her new dear friend in a beam of red energy, Lillie guided them from the lab entreating her guests to stop by anytime. Strolling outside shoulder to shoulder with diminutive Helia into the sunshine, Pyrimis felt her new companion's Pokéball rocking gently at her waistband matching the lightness rising in her own heart. What an unbelievable day of wonders! Who knew what amazing adventures lay over the horizon now with her own Pokémon at her side henceforth come what may... Chapter 8 Pyrimis bounced on her school shoes, barely able to contain her excitement as she waited outside the school for Mahina's arrival. Clutched tightly in her hand was the Pokéball containing her new friend - Popplio. She had spent all of Sunday evening bonding with the affectionate water Pokémon and could hardly wait to show Mahina. Soon enough, the cheery girl came bounding up the path towards Pyrimis. \\"Alola! Ready for another week?\\" Mahina greeted brightly before noticing her friend's eager expression. \\"Hey, what's got you looking so thrilled this early?\\" In response, Pyrimis triumphantly held out Popplio's Pokéball. \\"Ta-da! Remember Professor Lillie invited me to the research institute yesterday? Well she gifted me this Popplio as my starter Pokémon! Meet my new partner.\\" With a flash, the cute sea lion cub materialized before them with a happy bark. Mahina's eyes went wide. \\"Amazing!! Your very own Pokémon now!\\" She dropped to her knees, petting Popplio's slick fur as it trilled affectionately. \\"Oh I just adore Popplio - you two are perfect for each other! We need to commemorate your first steps as a real trainer.\\" Pyrimis beamed down proudly at her new companion. \\"I agree completely. I want to dive right into learning about Pokémon battles and contest strategies. Do you know anyone who could give a novice some guidance?\\" Mahina's thoughtful expression morphed into an eager grin. \\"As a matter of fact, I know just the place! C'mon, follow me.\\" Scooping up an excited Popplio into her arms, Pyrimis hurried after Mahina's lead towards a small annex building. Pushing open the doors, her eyes grew wide taking in the spacious hall packed with chatting students and scampering Pokémon. It had a strangely professional and bureaucratic air compared to Pyrimis's expectations. Various booths and desks lined the walls manned by older kids in crisp uniforms. \\"Welcome to headquarters for the Melemele Student Council and its Pokémon Activities Coordination branch!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her hand. \\"This is where young trainers hang out and organize stuff like battling tournaments, contest training, and field research trips.\\" Just then, a Pikachu came bounding through the bustling crowds towards them. It paused before Pyrimis, releasing a series of squeaks and gestures while energetically miming a battle stance. \\"Aww, looks like he wants to meet your new trainee Pokémon, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina translated affectionately. The electric mouse continued its charade a few moments more before scampering off, clearly beckoning them to follow. Exchanging curious glances with Popplio, Pyrimis hurried along in the yellow Pokémon's zig-zagging wake. They weaved through scattered lounge chairs and makeshift battle arenas until Pikachu finally skidded to a halt before a simple desk on the far side. Hopping atop the wooden surface directly facing them, the little creature allowed Pyrimis a clear view of the girl seated there for the first time. Recognition sparked instantly - it was the same green-haired observer from their odd classroom encounter days before! \\"Why Shmaya, I see you've brought some new friends by today!\\" Mahina exclaimed brightly to the older girl. Turning to Pyrimis she added \\"This is Shmaya, president of the whole student council. She's crazy smart and super nice!\\" Shmaya smiled warmly, absently petting her Pikachu who had nestled on her shoulders. \\"A pleasure meeting you officially, Pyrimis. And congratulations on beginning your Pokémon journey with such a wonderful companion.\\" She nodded graciously towards Popplio who barked his own polite greeting. Unsure what to make of this surprise familiar face in an unexpected role, Pyrimis managed a shy half-bow. \\"Thank you so much. I-I'm still very new to training of course but hoping to learn.\\" \\"As are we all, no matter our experience level with beloved partners.\\" Shmaya replied earnestly. \\"Growth is a never-ending process if one keeps an open and curious mind.\\" She studied Pyrimis a long thoughtful moment before continuing gently. \\"In fact, I must apologize if my observation the other day felt intrusive. As a council leader I make it my duty to know all members of our school community, especially those who...stand apart.\\" At this, Shmaya flicked her gaze subtly across the hall. Following it, Pyrimis noticed the other students automatically shifting away from a slim silver-haired figure who had just entered the room - Guanis. The mysterious girl moved through the space with her usual unearthly composure, students actively avoiding proximity as if by magnetic repulsion. Yet Guanis appeared fully accustomed to the isolation, not even lifting her eyes from the book cradled in one arm as she passed noiselessly towards a far corner chair. Frowning slightly, Pyrimis turned back towards Shmaya. \\"Why does everyone seem scared of Guanis? She saved my life from those bullies before.\\" Shmaya tilted her head contemplatively. \\"I understand she has quite a...reputation around here as rather eccentric and unapproachable despite standout talents. Some even consider Guanis dangerously antisocial. Honestly she remains an enigma to me as well.\\" Reading genuine empathy rather than judgment in Shmaya's eyes, Pyrimis felt emboldened to press further. \\"Well maybe if more people tried including Guanis respectfully instead of shunning her outright, that perception would change for the better over time.\\" A hint of wistfulness tinged Shmaya's smile. \\"I wholeheartedly agree. Perhaps your openness presents a fine model towards that goal...\\" Trailing off, the Student President began rummaging through her desk drawer before extracting a small silver pin engraved with a Pokéball symbol. \\"In fact Pyrimis, I would be delighted to officially invite you as the newest member of the Pokémon Activities Coordination division. Here is your membership badge - may it mark just the first step in your promising journey of growth ahead.\\" Bowing gratefully, Pyrimis fastened the shiny marker of acceptance proudly beside her own normal school pin. After a few more minutes of animated discussion about battle tactics, the first bell chimed faintly. \\"Best get to our classroom soon. Please stop by anytime though - I would enjoy hearing about your Pokémon adventures going forward!\\" Shmaya said warmly as she gathered up papers into her satchel. In the distance, Pyrimis spotted Guanis's slight form slipping soundlessly out the hall's side exit into shadowy freedom once more. \\"I will, thank you so much for everything today!\\" Pyrimis replied to Shmaya before turning towards Mahina who had been happily playing with Pyrimis's Popplio the whole time. Scooping up her tired water Pokémon, Pyrimis waved a final goodbye to Shmaya and her Pikachu, mind already racing towards ideas for properly training her very first battling companion. Please continue the above story to generate Chapter 9 of the novel.","output":"Chapter 9 With the silver membership badge gleaming on her school uniform, Pyrimis walked alongside Mahina towards the classroom, her mind awash with thoughts of future adventures and the friends she would make along the way. Popplio, too, seemed reinvigorated by their new status, occasionally hopping from her arms to perform a happy spin in the air. \\"That Shmaya's something else, isn't she?\\" Mahina mused, breaking into Pyrimis's daydream. \\"She runs the council so well, and you know what? I think you joining the Activities Coordination Division is perfect for you!\\" Pyrimis blushed at the praise. \\"Do you think so? I hope I'll be helpful. But I'm just so excited to learn more about Pokémon, especially from a trainer like you, Mahina!\\" Mahina laughed heartily, nudging her friend playfully. \\"Oh, I'll have you battling like a pro in no time!\\" As they entered the classroom, their conversation was cut short by a commotion at the far end of the room. A group of students gathered around a desk, their excited chatter filling the space. Mahina and Pyrimis exchanged curious glances before making their way through the crowd. At the center of attention stood a mysterious figure, back turned to them, orchestrating what appeared to be an intricate scale model of a Pokémon battling field. It was Guanis, her delicate hands moving with precision as she manipulated the miniature trainers and Pokémon, enacting a silent yet compelling story that had her audience entranced. Pyrimis watched, fascinated, as Guanis's display portrayed the nuances of combat positioning and strategy without a single word spoken. When the reenactment ended, applause erupted amongst the onlookers. Guanis offered them a rare, brief smile before gathering the pieces of her exhibit with care. Mahina leaned closer to Pyrimis, whispering in a hushed tone, \\"See? She's got incredible knowledge about Pokémon and tactics. There's a lot more to Guanis than people suspect.\\" Pyrimis nodded, feeling a new sense of respect for the solitary girl. \\"You're right, Mahina. There's depth there I wish others would try to see.\\" Just then, the teacher walked in, clapping his hands for attention. \\"Alright, class! Settle down, please! We have a very exciting project starting today.\\" The room hushed as students found their seats, curiosity piqued. \\"We will begin preparing for the annual Melemele Pokémon Tournament,\\" he continued. \\"This schoolwide event will challenge your skills as trainers, directly applying what you've learned both academically and practically.\\" The announcement sent a ripple of excitement through the classroom, with many students exchanging eager looks or pumping their fists in anticipation. The teacher gestured towards a stack of papers on his desk. \\"I will be handing out forms for you all to fill out. These will let you choose your preferred event—battles, contests, or even research presentations for those of you who enjoy that aspect of Pokémon studies.\\" As the forms were passed out, Pyrimis gazed down at the options before her. Battle, Contest, Research... Each avenue called out to her with its own allure, setting her heart racing with the thrill of choice and promise. Popplio rested now in her lap, his dark eyes meeting hers as if to ask, \\"Which adventure shall we embark on together?\\" Turning to Mahina, Pyrimis clasped the form between trembling fingers. \\"Mahina, can you help me train for the battles? I want to enter the tournament with Popplio, and I want us to be ready.\\" Mahina's face lit up with pride. \\"Absolutely, Pyrimis! We'll show them what a great team you and Popplio can be!\\" And there, in that bustling classroom filled with the spark of competition and the camaraderie of peers, Pyrimis set her intentions with newfound purpose. She would enter the tournament and, with Popplio by her side, she would pour her heart into every moment, every lesson learned.

In this imaginary scene, we find ourselves in a world where a stern, strict, cold, distant, disciplined, and logical scientist seme is walking home late at night. His footsteps echo through the empty streets as the moon casts an eerie glow upon him. With a focused gaze, he notices a small cardboard box tucked away in an alleyway. Curiosity piques his interest, and he approaches the box cautiously. What he discovers inside surprises him greatly—a lovely delicate, shy, blushing, extremely naive, and timid beautiful uke kitty boy. The uke kitty boy's eyes shimmer with tears as he trembles, his delicate hands covering his face. Though silent, his cries speak volumes, echoing pain and vulnerability. Seme Scientist: (in a stern yet gentle tone) What are you doing here, little one? Why are you hiding in this dark corner, scared and silently crying? Uke Kitty Boy: (in a soft, trembling voice) I...I'm afraid. I...I didn't mean to bother anyone. I just needed a safe place to hide. Seme Scientist's logical demeanor starts to dissolve, revealing the hidden warmth within. Seme Scientist: (his voice softening) You need not fear any longer. Come out of that cold cardboard box, for you have stumbled upon someone who can offer you the warmth and protection you seek. The uke kitty boy hesitates, his timid nature making it difficult for him to accept this unexpected act of kindness. Uke Kitty Boy: (whispering, still unsure) Are you sure...you won't hurt me?

Within it, crouched a lovely, delicate uke kitty boy named Maxwell, his timid and innocent nature emanating a wave of vulnerability. Dr. Sternwood, driven by an unfamiliar surge of protectiveness, approached Maxwell cautiously. \\"Why are you hiding here, my precious little one?\\" he asked, his voice commanding yet tinged with a hint of concern. Maxwell's ears perked up, his blushing face peeking out of the box. \\"I-I...I'm scared,\\" he stammered softly, his voice as fragile as a fluttering butterfly. Tears glistened in his eyes, silently betraying his inner turmoil. Dr. Sternwood's logical mind fought the unfamiliar wave of emotions, but his true nature couldn't be suppressed any longer. Falling to his knees beside the box, he gently extended his hand toward Maxwell, coaxing him out of his trembling refuge. \\"You have nothing to fear, my delicate beauty. I will protect you.\\" As Maxwell timidly took Dr. Sternwood's offered hand, their fingertips touched, and a spark of electrifying connection passed between them. The stern scientist's icy exterior melted away, revealing a passionate heart yearning for love, while Maxwell found solace and security in the arms of a man who would cherish and protect him. With newfound feelings intertwining their destinies, they embarked on a journey where the disciplined scientist learned to embrace the beauty of emotions, guided by the delicate kitty boy's innocent wisdom. Together, they traversed the landscape of their hearts, discovering the depths of love and the transformative power of understanding.

La diferencia entre producción ecológica y producción orgánica radica en el enfoque y los estándares utilizados en cada una. La producción ecológica se enfoca en la utilización sostenible de los recursos naturales, evitando el uso de productos químicos sintéticos y promoviendo prácticas de manejo que respeten el equilibrio ecológico. La producción orgánica, por otro lado, se enfoca en la utilización de métodos y prácticas agrícolas que minimicen la utilización de insumos sintéticos y promuevan el uso de fertilizantes y pesticidas naturales. 4. Las labores agro técnicas son todas aquellas actividades que se realizan en la agricultura para el manejo y cuidado de los cultivos. Esto incluye labores como la preparación del suelo, siembra, riego, fertilización, control de plagas y enfermedades, poda, cosecha, entre otras. 5. La cebolla es una planta bienal, lo que significa que su ciclo de vida se divide en dos fases. En la primera fase, la planta produce hojas y forma el bulbo, que es la parte comestible de la cebolla. En la segunda fase, la planta produce una flor y semillas para reproducirse. Sin embargo, en la producción comercial de cebollas, a menudo se cosecha antes de que entre en la segunda fase, cuando el bulbo alcanza su tamaño y madurez óptimos. 6. Los eco tipos en horticultura se refieren a diferentes variedades o cultivares de una especie de planta que han desarrollado características adaptativas específicas a un entorno particular. Estas características pueden incluir resistencia a enfermedades o plagas, adaptación al clima o a diferentes tipos de suelo, entre otros. 7. El complejo productivo del ajo en Bolivia está integrado principalmente por los municipios de Challapata, Caracollo y Paria, en la región de Oruro. Estos municipios cuentan con condiciones favorables para la producción de ajo, como suelos adecuados y clima propicio. 8. El IVD es el Índice de Valor de Dosis, utilizado en la producción de ajo para determinar la cantidad adecuada de fertilizantes y/o nutrientes que se deben aplicar al cultivo. Se basa en el análisis de suelos y plantas para evaluar las necesidades nutricionales de las plantas y garantizar un buen desarrollo y rendimiento de los cultivos. 9. El raleo es una práctica que se realiza en la horticultura para eliminar o adelgazar las plantas o frutos demasiado numerosos o pequeños. Se realiza para asegurar que los recursos y nutrientes disponibles se distribuyan de manera óptima entre las plantas o frutos restantes, lo que resulta en un mayor crecimiento, desarrollo y calidad del cultivo. 10. El manejo integrado de la esclerotinia en el cultivo de lechuga implica una combinación de diferentes medidas de control para prevenir y reducir los efectos de esta enfermedad. Algunas de estas medidas pueden incluir la rotación de cultivos, el uso de variedades resistentes, la eliminación de residuos vegetales infectados, la aplicación de fungicidas preventivos y el monitoreo regular de la presencia y desarrollo de la enfermedad."},{"instruction":"\`\`\`you think it's possible to make an automatic ip address sortager through html,css,javascript? the idea is to sort out ips on ack flag and remove them from list. any ideas?not sure, got only wireshark. also, maybe it's easier to do it all in python? but how about an ui, in that case?maybe if I drop a list of ips directly in wireshark, could it sort them out or auto queue each ip in the list automatically? because wireshark is too complex instrument.maybe then we can simply omit this specific packet inspection function, and simply sort all ips based on a timeout in queue?the problem is in this ack flag and its mechanism. how it should work correctly, to sort ips based on a specific ack timeout then?no, without packet inspection. how this ack flag works? do you have any clue or not?so, the problem here. some ips in the list simply stucking on place at that exact ack flag, without further connectivity. maybe if we sort all things based on a timeout and some http response (if returned), then we eventually can omit this packet inspection problem as well.so, another problem that these ips cannot connect through browser on a secure https protocol, so we would need to use both http first and then a secure version https for in each ips in the list. yes, the logic is plain simple: we remove all ips from the list that reached a timeout, and keep all ips that got returned any http or https response. anything else you have to add, gpt?all we need is a response returned only, we don't need any other data or something else.now reread everything above and make a technical prompt to yourself, to make this ui in html,css,javascipt. also, need to set an adjustable default timeout for in each ip at 5 sec. and queue all ips sequentially, to not overflow the stack. \\"Technical Prompt: To create a UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for sorting IP addresses based on responsiveness with an adjustable default timeout of 5 seconds, while queuing the IPs sequentially, follow these steps: HTML: Create an input field for entering IP addresses. Add a button to add IPs to the queue. Create a container element to display the sorted IP addresses. Add an input field to set the timeout value (defaulted to 5 seconds). CSS: Style the input fields, button, and container element as desired. JavaScript: Create an array to store the IP addresses. Implement a queue mechanism to process IPs sequentially. Set an adjustable default timeout of 5 seconds for each IP address. Use JavaScript’s Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP or HTTPS requests to the IP addresses. Set a timeout using JavaScript’s setTimeout function for each request and remove IPs that exceed the timeout. Keep track of the IPs that receive a response (regardless of the response content). Sort the IP addresses based on responsiveness. Update the UI by displaying the sorted IP addresses in the container element. Utilize event listeners to add IPs to the queue when the button is clicked. Adjustments: Implement logic to queue IPs sequentially without overflowing the stack. Consider limiting the number of simultaneous requests to avoid overwhelming the system. Remember to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request process. By following this technical prompt, you should be able to create a UI in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that sorts IP addresses based on responsiveness within the specified timeout, while queuing IPs sequentially and allowing adjustment of the default timeout value.\\", \\"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> /* CSS styles for the UI elements */ .input-container { margin-bottom: 10px; } .ip-address { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"input-container\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"ipInput\\" placeholder=\\"Enter IP Address\\"> <button id=\\"addIpButton\\">Add IP</button> </div> <div class=\\"input-container\\"> <label for=\\"timeoutInput\\">Timeout (in seconds):</label> <input type=\\"number\\" id=\\"timeoutInput\\" value=\\"5\\"> </div> <div id=\\"ipContainer\\"></div> <script> let ipAddresses = []; let responsiveIPs = []; function processQueue() { if (ipAddresses.length > 0) { const ipAddress = ipAddresses.shift(); makeRequest(ipAddress); } } function makeRequest(ipAddress) { const timeout = document.getElementById('timeoutInput').value * 1000; const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {}, timeout); fetch('http://' + ipAddress) .then(response => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); responsiveIPs.push(ipAddress); }) .catch(error => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); }); } function sortIPs() { responsiveIPs.sort((a, b) => {}); } function updateUI() { const ipContainer = document.getElementById('ipContainer'); ipContainer.innerHTML = ''; responsiveIPs.forEach(ip => { const div = document.createElement('div'); div.classList.add('ip-address'); div.textContent = ip; ipContainer.appendChild(div); }); } const addIpButton = document.getElementById('addIpButton'); addIpButton.addEventListener('click', () => { const ipInput = document.getElementById('ipInput'); const ipAddress = ipInput.value; if (ipAddress) { ipAddresses.push(ipAddress); ipInput.value = ''; processQueue(); } }); <\/script> </body> </html>\\". got the problem that modern browsers simply blocking all insecure traffic through http or mixed-mode. any ideas how to bypass this for code to be able to knock-knock through http somewhere in the browser?\`\`\`. just got an another idea here. what if we look for an NS error in browser \\"transferred\\" returned and base overall sortage on if there's an NS error returned or timout ended?","output":"If modern browsers are blocking insecure traffic through HTTP or mixed-mode, you can consider the following options to bypass it: 1. Use HTTPS: Instead of sending requests through HTTP, you can generate HTTPS requests. This will ensure that the browser doesn't block the traffic due to security reasons. 2. Proxy Server: Set up a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your browser and the target IP addresses. By configuring the browser to use the proxy server, you can handle the HTTP requests through the proxy and bypass any security restrictions enforced by the browser. 3. Disable Browser Security Restrictions: You can modify browser settings or use browser extensions to disable some security restrictions temporarily. However, this approach may compromise the security of your browsing environment, so proceed with caution. Regarding the idea of looking for an NS error in the browser's \\"transferred\\" response, it may not be feasible. NS errors typically indicate issues with DNS resolution, not related to ACK flag or IP connectivity. Analyzing network traffic at the packet level using tools like Wireshark would provide more accurate insights into such issues. Keep in mind that bypassing security restrictions or manipulating network traffic comes with potential risks. It is advisable to follow recommended security practices and obtain proper permissions when performing any network-related tasks."},{"instruction":"\\"NS errors typically indicate\\". you don't got or what? all we need is a response returned only, we don't need any other data or something else. just need something on which overall sortage could be based on, alist of simple timeouts. do you understand that simple fact or you are just robot?","output":"I apologize for any confusion. Yes, I understand that you are looking for a response from the server to determine whether an IP address is responsive or not. If you only need to check for a response, you can indeed base the sorting on timeouts or the presence of any response. To implement this, you can use JavaScript's Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP requests to the IP addresses. Set a timeout using JavaScript's setTimeout function and remove the IP addresses that exceed the timeout. Keep track of the IP addresses that receive a response (regardless of the response content) and sort them based on their responsiveness. This approach does not require inspecting specific packet flags or dealing with NS (Name Server) errors. It simply checks for a response from the server within the specified timeout. My responses are generated by an AI language model, but I am here to assist you with your questions."},{"instruction":"no, you are just a robot. need any other factor as these ns errors together with timeouts, for accuracy. how can you get these ns errors in the browser by using this JavaScript’s Fetch API?","output":"I apologize for any confusion caused. When using JavaScript's Fetch API, you won't directly receive NS (Name Server) errors in the browser response. The Fetch API primarily handles HTTP responses and does not provide specific information about DNS resolution errors. To capture NS errors, you would typically need to rely on network monitoring tools or libraries that provide more detailed information about DNS resolution. One such tool is Wireshark, which you mentioned in your initial question. Wireshark can capture network traffic and provide insights into DNS resolution errors. In the context of your goal to sort IP addresses based on responsiveness, it may be more efficient to focus on timeouts and HTTP responses, as they directly indicate whether the IP address is accessible and responsive. Incorporating NS errors would require additional complexity and potentially external tools or libraries to capture DNS-related information. If you have access to server-side code, you may consider implementing DNS resolution checks or using APIs that provide DNS-related information for more accurate sorting."},{"instruction":"no, these ips addresses are not that simple. they need to be queued through insecure http or through specific port. any other methods in the browser to send a signal to backend ip address than get or post? any ideas?","output":"If you need to send a signal to a backend IP address from the browser, apart from using GET or POST requests, you can consider using other HTTP methods such as PUT, DELETE, or PATCH depending on the specific functionality you want to achieve. Additionally, there are other techniques you can explore: 1. WebSocket: WebSocket provides a full-duplex communication channel between the browser and the server. It allows for bidirectional communication, enabling real-time data exchange. 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE): SSE is a unidirectional communication technique where the server sends continuous updates to the browser. It can be useful for scenarios where you need to receive server updates without requiring an explicit request from the browser. 3. WebRTC: WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication between browsers. It can be used for real-time audio, video, and data transmission. It's important to note that these methods might have limitations or require specific server-side configurations. You'll need to ensure that the backend server supports the chosen method and implement the necessary handling code on both the client and server sides. Always consider security implications when implementing communication methods between the browser and the backend server, and ensure proper authorization and authentication mechanisms are in place."},{"instruction":"any ideas?","output":"If you need to send a signal to a backend IP address from the browser without using GET or POST requests, you can consider the following options: 1. HEAD Request: You can use the HTTP HEAD method to send a request to the backend IP address. The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the response headers without the response body. This can be useful if you only need to check the status or perform a lightweight request. 2. OPTIONS Request: The HTTP OPTIONS method is used to retrieve the allowed HTTP methods and other information about a server or resource. It allows you to check the available methods supported by the backend IP address and determine how you can interact with it. 3. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If the backend IP address resides on a different origin, you may encounter restrictions due to the same-origin policy. In such cases, you can implement CORS on the backend server to allow the browser to send requests to that IP address from another origin. 4. Custom Headers: You can add custom headers to your requests to provide specific instructions or information to the backend server. You can define and handle these custom headers on the server-side to trigger specific actions or behaviors. These are a few ideas to consider when sending signals to a backend IP address from the browser. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of your application and the capabilities of the backend server you are interacting with."},{"instruction":"try adapt this code in the first post for options queue. output all code in single block.","output":"Certainly!

He doesn’t want to go back, he wants to travel Europe, so he finds a way to transform me into him without me realizing due to being unconscious, and then sets off to Europe leaving me stuck as him. The transformation is practical. No one will believe I’m my real self. I get sent off to Chad's school.","output":"Never thought I'd be sitting here now, sharing this insane story. I'm just a regular dude, a young professional thriving in the industry, navigating life with my Americana charm. I have a penchant for plaid shirts, denim, and leather boots, an aesthetic that's become my signature at the agency where I work. Life took a bizarre turn when the CEO's son, Chad, swaggered into our office. Chad? Well, imagine the polar opposite of my reflection. A collage of brand logos walking on two legs, he's the embodiment of every douchy, rich kid stereotype. Frat boy with an ego the size of his trust fund. He'd been around, flaunting his silver spoon attitude, making it painfully clear he'd rather be anywhere than here. He'd tell anyone left unfortunately near him about his grand plans to ditch the rules and travel Europe instead of returning to university life. It's almost funny how we couldn't have been more different, yet our paths were about to converge in the most unexpected way. On the eve of his supposed departure back to school, some heavy reality must have hit Chad because that's when his plans took a dark turn - a turn that involved me in a way I'd never have anticipated. The last thing I remember was feeling light-headed at the office, everyone had left for the night except for Chad and me. Maybe I should've been more cautious, but how could I have known that this frat boy had concocted a devious plan that would upend my reality? I woke up feeling... off. But it wasn't just a feeling; everything was off. At first glance, I didn't recognize the face staring back at me in the mirror. It was Chad. No, better said, I was Chad. What unfolded next was straight out of a B-rated body-swap movie, except there was no gimmicky magic here, just a chillingly well-executed identity theft. Chad had managed to transform me into his spitting image. Using practical means – forged documents, expertly photoshopped IDs, even instructing his closest friends to confirm I was him. It was terrifyingly thorough. Meanwhile, Chad, reveling in my identity, escaped across the ocean to Europe, leaving his old life, including the responsibilities and suffocating expectations, behind. No one believed my story. How could they? To everyone else, I was just Chad acting out in yet another bout of strange self-sabotage. All my protests, my insistence, fell on deaf ears. I was effectively imprisoned in another man's life. I found myself forcefully returned to Chad's university, living his frat boy existence. Navigating his world of privilege, dealing with people who saw me as him, and unable to convince anyone of the truth. The cruel irony? People now celebrated the changes in 'Chad'. They said college had matured me. If they only knew. My Americana clothing feels like an absurd costume now, barely a reminder of the person I once was. The struggle to reclaim my identity continues every day, but I'm determined. I will get my life back, one way or another. In the meantime, I'm stuck here, penning down a story too bizarre to believe, hoping against hope that someone out there might just listen and see the real me through Chad's eyes."},{"instruction":"When he knocked me out, Chad also changed my hair, facial hair, skin tone, tattoos, piercings, nose, jawline, eyebrows, and more to look like his","output":"Everything about my life was pretty standard until one average day at work became the prelude to an unimaginable situation. Out of college and into the grind, I was the Americana-style guy in an agency, getting by with a taste for the simple, rugged look – you know, jeans, worn-in leather jackets, flannel shirts. That was until Chad, the CEO's overly-entitled son, entered the scene. Chad was... well, let's say he was crafted from a different mold. A trust fund frat boy with an air of arrogance that formed an almost palpable cloud around him. His life was a constant vacation interrupted by inconvenient bouts of \\"real\\" life, and our agency happened to be part of those unwelcome interruptions. He came to us like a rolling storm, his eyes set on a future that didn't involve continuing his education but instead chasing pleasure across European landscapes. He should have been back in college, but it was abundantly clear that Chad longed for an endless escapade, free from the responsibilities that his father's success imposed on him. He wore his disdain for returning to university like an obnoxious cologne, overpowering and impossible to ignore. And then suddenly, his disdain became my nightmare. I remember the day vividly except for the moment it all turned black. Chad and I were the last two in the office, and then, nothing. The next thing I knew, the world was not as I left it. I was groggy, disoriented, and when I finally found a mirror, I realized I was not staring at myself – at least, not the self I had always known. In a horrifically literal sense, I was now Chad. He didn't just knock me unconscious; he stole my identity, siphoned it away while I was powerless to stop him. When I awoke, I was a mirror image of him, right down to the last meticulously groomed hair. He had transformed me completely – my hair, facial hair, skin tone, even added tattoos, piercings, and changed my facial structure. My nose wasn't mine, the jawline too strong, eyebrows too manicured. He had recreated me in his image, a living clone of his former self. The details were excruciating. I had to confront the hard evidence every time I passed a reflection. Chad was now gallivanting somewhere in Europe, draped in my life, while I was stranded in his, a prisoner trapped within another man's flesh. I tried telling people the truth, but who would believe such a story? When was the last time you heard of a rich kid swapping places with someone else just to skip school? It was ludicrous, something out of a sci-fi flick or a novel – it wasn't supposed to be my reality. Yet, here I was, pleading, shouting into the void that I wasn't Chad, that somewhere under this crafted facade was me. But to everyone else, I was just the CEO's son with a new acting-out phase. His friends were in on it, confirming my identity as Chad to anyone who questioned. His father simply rolled his eyes at my protests, attributing them to avant-garde rebellion or a cry for attention. They sent me off to the university as Chad, forcing me to take his place in that foreign life. It was a cruel twist of fate: my own world was inaccessible, as unreachable as the past. Every step I took in Chad's shoes was a sharp reminder of what I had lost. Some days I'd reach for my trustworthy denim jacket, and the unfamiliar weight of Chad's preference in clothing would weigh on my shoulders like a lead cloak. His preferences, his friends, his lifestyle – they were all iron shackles reminding me how far I was from home. But I haven't given up. Not yet. By some means, with some stroke of luck or twist of fate, I will restore my life. I will reclaim my identity. I must. The alternative is unthinkable – a life spent as Chad, forever separated from the man I truly am."},{"instruction":"Describe my appearance before and after Chad made me him","output":"Before Chad's elaborate ruse, my appearance was the epitome of what some would call classic Americana style, deeply rooted in a traditional, rugged aesthetic. I had a head of casually styled hair that probably spent less time being combed and more time under the brim of a baseball cap or tousled by the wind. The color? A natural, unassuming shade, a sun-kissed brown that never drew too much attention. My face was clean-shaven or adorned with a few days' worth of stubble, nothing too sculpted or intentional. I favored the ease of low maintenance over the curated looks of fashion magazines. My skin had the honest, modest tone of someone who spends just enough time outdoors, a healthy complexion untouched by tanning salons or layers of product. No ink marked my skin; I had no tattoos displaying artful expressions or declarations. My body was a canvas reserved for the scars and marks earned by genuine experiences, not the needle of a tattoo artist. Piercings? None. I strayed from the additional metal, preferring the simplicity of being unadorned. My eyebrows were just eyebrows – managed, sure, but not sculpted. They weren't a statement or a fashion. They were expressive but in a way that said more about my emotions than my personal grooming habits. And my nose? It was distinctively mine, a feature unaltered since birth, complementing my unembellished jawline. That was me: unprocessed, unfiltered, comfortable in my own skin. But after Chad had his way, conscious of it or not, I became a distorted reflection, a doppelganger bearing his signature look. My hair was now immaculately coiffed to match his style—a deliberate cut, a shade that didn't feel like my own. Facial hair sculpted to mimic Chad's preference, etching out a jawline that now seemed sharper, more pronounced—a counterfeit of his exact look. My skin tone had been altered to match his, a bronzed hue that spoke of deliberate tanning or careful application of products, giving the impression of a lavish lifestyle blending leisure with luxury. Tattoos appeared on my previously uninked skin, carefully replicated to match his own ink, patterns and symbols that meant nothing to me but were his identity markers. Even piercings had been added, alien embellishments that felt intrusive on my earlobes and perhaps elsewhere. My eyebrows had been shaped artistically, perhaps even tinted to align with Chad's aesthetic. They felt out of place above eyes that no longer recognized the person they belonged to. And my nose, once uniquely mine, had been transformed—non-surgically or through makeup trickery—to replicate his more chiseled profile. The new me was a crafted masterpiece of duplicity, every last detail engineered to erase the person I was and overwrite it with the essence of Chad. The transformation was so comprehensive, so thorough, that looking into the mirror was like staring into a parallel universe where I was him, and he was out living a life free from the ties that bound him—all at the expense of my own existence."},{"instruction":"Describe the kind of clothes I'm forced to wear as Chad","output":"As Chad, my wardrobe underwent a drastic transformation, aligning with the tastes befitting a rich CEO's son rather than my own Americana penchant. Gone were the sturdy denim and flannel shirts that resonated with my sense of self. They were replaced by a collection of high-end designer labels and the latest trends that screamed wealth and a preoccupation with status. Suddenly, I was thrust into a world where every garment was a statement piece. I found myself forced into slim-fitting, European-cut blazers that felt too constricted compared to my relaxed jackets. Shirts were no longer the comfortable, breathable cotton I was used to, but rather posh, silky fabrics with bold patterns or crisp dress shirts that were a little too pristine. My legs were now encased in designer jeans or trousers - those with strategically placed rips and a price tag that could pay a month's rent back when I was myself. The shoes were another matter entirely. The durable, scuff-friendly boots were replaced by an ostentatious array of footwear: Italian leather loafers, polished to an uncomfortable sheen; bright, immaculate sneakers that felt like they belonged in a display case rather than the pavement; and dress shoes that seemed to ebb closer to works of art than something meant to tread the earth. Accessories were now mandatory. I was decked out with watches that were more like arm-candy statements, each one probably worth more than my entire former wardrobe. Chains and bracelets that added a jingle with every movement, and rings – I had to wear rings that felt foreign on my fingers, each piece undoubtedly telling a story of luxury and privilege that I had no part in writing. Even the casual wear wasn't casual anymore; it was the casual that tried too hard – tees that hugged too tight, displaying logos of brands I'd never cared to pronounce, let alone wear. Athletic wear that was too pristine for actual athletics, crafted by designers who probably thought a gym was a place to be seen, not to sweat. Every piece of 'Chad' clothing felt like a costume, an elaborate, extravagant disguise that kept my true identity hidden beneath layers of silk, cashmere, and pricey cotton blends. It was an armor made not of iron or steel but of brand names and price tags, each article a shackle reminding me that I was living a life that belonged to someone else."},{"instruction":"Write the following story. I have a preppy aesthetic. I'm on a road trip with friends. We stop at a rest stop. I meet a country boy who looks eerily like me except he's a little bigger, a little tanner, and has different hairstyle and facial hair style and dresses like a country boy. We're mesmerized by each other and opt to swap clothes in the bathroom as an experiment. After the swap the country boy quickly restyles his facial hair and hair to match mine with the help of a pocket comb and scissors. He then makes my hair and facial hair look more like his old hair and facial hair. I get distracted and the country boy leaves with my friends having stolen my identity. I check my pockets. I only have his things not my own.","output":"With a penchant for crisp collars and tailored chinos, my preppy aesthetic set me apart from the sprawling landscapes that unfolded like a canvas as my friends and I cruised down the highway. We were a merry band of college kids embarking on the quintessential American adventure – a road trip without a care in the world, except maybe where we'd rest our heads come evening. We spotted the rest stop – a small oasis of civilization amid miles of nature's splendor – and decided it was high time to stretch our legs. While my friends beelined for snacks and postcards, I gravitated toward the vending machines, my gaze catching a reflection that wasn't quite my own. He stood there, a slightly more robust version of myself but with a sun-kissed, tanned complexion highlighting his country roots. His hair, a tousled mane, stood in stark contrast to my carefully combed locks, and his facial hair – a full, well-maintained beard – was nothing like my own clean-shaven look. His attire screamed 'country' in a way that mine whispered 'academia': denim over a plaid shirt, with boots that told tales of dusty trails and hard labor. We locked eyes, and in that instant, we knew we were each other's mirror image – sort of. The fascination was immediate. He chuckled, a deep, hearty sound, and I could only muster a bewildered grin in return. It was his idea to switch clothes, an impromptu experiment driven by our twin-like visages and the spontaneity youth afforded. Secluded in the dim light of the rest stop bathroom, we swapped outfits. I shimmied into his jeans, which hugged my legs a tad too snugly, and slipped on his worn boots. The plaid shirt felt foreign yet oddly comforting. He, with an effortless charm, donned my pastel polo and chinos, looking like he'd walked straight out of a prep school yearbook. He then produced a pocket comb and scissors with a knowing smile; within minutes, he had expertly re-styled his hair and beard, molding them into a mirror of my usual grooming. With the same tools, he tousled my hair, trimmed my facial hair into a rough approximation of his former stubble, and I have to admit, he had a certain finesse. However, a cause for concern had yet to reveal itself. As I admired our transformations, a distraction arose – laughter, the voices of my friends not far from the door. Unbeknownst to me, this would be the blade that cut the thread of my identity. When I turned back, the country boy was gone, vanished like dust in the wind. My friends, none the wiser, drove off with a stranger who waved to me, a mischievous glimmer in his eyes. Panic set in as I patted down the clothing he'd left me in. My wallet, my phone, my keys – all were gone, replaced by his belongings. Left stranded at the rest stop, disguising myself in boots that felt heavier with every passing second, I was no longer the preppy wanderer I'd been at dawn. Now, I was just a shadow, an outline of the country boy who'd taken my place, left to figure out the hows and whys of my predicament with nothing but the open road as my witness."},{"instruction":"The country boys parents call me over addressing me as him. They drive me to their small town home, they refuse to believe I'm not their son citing his constant desire to escape this small town. I need to find a way back to California where my family is. I try calling them but they all ignore my unknown number. Eventually the country boys father comes in and tells me I'm going to be late for my shift as the security guard of a local warehouse. I don't plan to go but then he threatens to punish me if I don't go work. I find the security guard uniform in the country boys closet and put it on. Then I use his best up truck to go to work","output":"I stood there shell-shocked, the echo of departing laughter ringing in my ears, while the harsh reality that I was now literally in the country boy's shoes—or rather, his boots—began to sink in. \\"Jackson! What're you doin' standin' around? C'mon now,\\" a voice bellowed across the parking lot. I turned to see a middle-aged couple, his parents I assumed, approaching me. Their faces were etched with the lines of hard work and sun, eyes weary but kind. My protest stuck in my throat; they resembled the country boy so closely, there was no doubt they were his kin. But when I tried to explain, to tell them who I actually was, they merely laughed off my pleas. \\"Oh, Jackson, always the joker. Always talkin' 'bout big dreams and leavin'. We ain't fallin' for your stories no more. You best come on home 'fore you're late to work.\\" Before I knew it, I was ushered into an old pickup truck that rumbled with stories of a life so vastly different from my own. We drove through scenic routes that led to a quaint town, where every street corner seemed to hold a memory for someone who I wasn't. Their home was modest, a small-town abode filled with the essence of lived-in comfort and familial warmth, a contrast to my own distant, urban upbringing. I felt uneasy navigating through the country boy's life, surrounded by his photographs, his trophies, remnants of a life craving something beyond the town's embrace. With every attempt to reclaim my identity, the same response came – a shake of the head and a knowing look. My plight appeared to them as nothing but the antics of their son, the storyteller with wild dreams. In desperation, I reached for the phone. I dialed number after number, the ones I knew by heart, only to be met by the outro of rings flowing into ignorable voicemails. The sting of rejection from unknown number screens was sharp; my own family's voices felt like they were from another era. As the evening approached, my temporary father-figure ambled in, his voice firm yet not unkind. \\"You gotta shift tonight. Don't be late, or you'll know consequences.\\" His gaze held a weight that left no room for argument. My defiance waned, and the stern promise of punishment felt alarmingly tangible in this new reality. Reluctantly, I excavated the country boy's closet, finding the starched uniform of a security guard. Slipping into the costume of another man's life, I faced a reflection that was him, not me. His truck keys jangled in my hand as I stepped into the evening's embrace, driving the beaten pickup toward the local warehouse. Under the orange glow of fading daylight, I navigated the streets that were his, dressed in another man's authority, playing the role that wasn't mine to claim. I went through the motions, adrift on a sea of uncertainty, every moment fueling my resolve to find my way back to the life I knew, back to California, back to being me."},{"instruction":"His coworker gives me a country boy mullet when I lose a bet with him.","output":"Adjusting to life in the small town was one challenge following another, each more unexpected than the last. I tried to keep my head down, to get through the shift without incident, but the universe or maybe just sheer bad luck had other plans. There was a camaraderie among the security guards, a brotherhood born out of shared night shifts and the quiet lulls that let jokes and stories fill the space. The country boy whose life I'd stumbled into was clearly no stranger to this atmosphere. His coworker—a burly man with a laugh that rattled the walls—slapped my back, drawing me into the fold as if I'd never been an outsider. The evening trudged on, and with it came the games meant to pass the time. The stakes seemed innocent enough, a light wager here and there, until the bet that changed it all came to light. \\"If you lose, we give you a haircut. A real country style to match your roots,\\" the coworker declared, a glint of mischief in his eye. Every bone in my body wanted to refuse, to walk away from the table, but Jackson's confidence wasn't something I could just shrug off. It seemed to linger in the clothes, in the expectations of those who thought they knew me. So I played, I laughed, and I lost. Before I could muster a defense, the guards were rallying with excitement as my coworker pulled out a pair of clippers and a grin wide enough to split his face. The rest stop encounter seemed more surreal than ever as electric buzzing filled my ears, and I had to fight the dizzy sensation of losing yet another piece of my identity to the hands of chance and rural tradition. The result was a mullet that marked me undoubtedly as a country boy. The sides and front trimmed down, while the back was left to flow in a business-in-the-front, party-in-the-back testament of my lost bet. The mirror showed me a stranger, the reflection more Jackson than ever, and it hit home how far from myself I had truly become. The bet, the mullet, the boots—they all painted a picture of a man who was supposed to be content with his lot in life, not one plotting his escape back to the golden coasts of California. But beneath the new haircut and the layers of Jackson's existence, determination kindled within me, the certainty that I would reclaim my identity, no matter what small-town trials I had to endure along the way."},{"instruction":"I'm in Alabama. How do I eventually manage to make it back to California","output":"Stranded in Alabama with a mullet that wasn't my choice and caught up in a life that wasn't mine, the journey back to California seemed to stretch out before me, vast and daunting. But the resolve within me grew with each passing day, fueled by the knowledge that somewhere out there, my real life was waiting. First, I focused on assembling resources. The country boy's life had few luxuries, but it offered me some essentials—a roof over my head, a job, and a small income. I decided to save every penny I could, foregoing any non-essential spending and slowly building a budget for my journey. Adapting to my circumstances was key. While I owed Jackson's family nothing, the disguise of his life was a necessary deception to maintain my stay. I played my part, working the security shifts diligently, becoming a model employee to avoid suspicion and secure my finances. In the meantime, I began reaching out to my family and friends again, this time in a different approach. Recognizing the futility of unknown numbers, I scoured Jackson's things for anything that could be bartered or sold in exchange for a burner phone. Once obtained, I sent texts explaining my bizarre situation, knowing they seemed far-fetched but hoping the level of detail would at least raise doubts and curiosity. Social media became a potential ally. Without access to my accounts, I created new, anonymous profiles and tried to connect with my connections, sending private messages to explain my predicament and share specific, private memories that only I would know. Awareness of my absence had to start building momentum back home. A missing person doesn't go unnoticed for long, so I started sending emails from the library's public computer to local newspapers in California, sharing my story under the guise of a concerned friend who couldn't reach me. I couldn't just rely on technology though—I also tapped into the human network. Conversations with friendly faces at the warehouse led to stories of travel and dreams, and through it, I discreetly gleaned tips and tricks for long-haul journeys. Truck drivers passing through shared valuable insights about routes and the best ways to catch a long-distance ride. And so, when I had saved enough money and felt the stirrings of a response from my personal outreach, I tendered my resignation as Jackson's security guard replacement. Armed with a backpack, the money tucked safely inside, and a head full of directions, I waited on the interstate's edge. Thumb outstretched, the universal sign of a traveler seeking passage. Ride by ride, I ventured closer to the West Coast. With every mile put behind me, every truck stop, diner chat, and shared ride took me one step nearer to reclaiming my stolen life. Finally, I saw California's welcome sign, and with it, I felt the weight of Jackson's existence start to slip away. Bit by bit, the mullet grew out, the country clothes were shed, and my features began to feel like my own again. The journey was long, and the struggle was hard, but with unwavering determination and a bit of luck, I made it back to where I belonged. In a battle for identity, where every tool at my disposal was used, I emerged as a testament to perseverance. Reunited with my real family and friends, the story of my doppelganger from Alabama remained, a reminder that no matter who you are, or where you're from, home is always worth fighting for."},{"instruction":"traduire ce texte en arabe La loi normale, étant une distribution continue symétrique, est souvent utilisée pour modeliser des problèmes économiques et financiers en raison de sa simplicité et de ses caractéristiques bien connues.

His keen senses picked up on the sound of soft sniffling and trembling. Intrigued, he approached cautiously. Inside the makeshift shelter, crouched a delicate and shy uke kitty boy. His sparkling emerald eyes were filled with fear, and his cheeks flushed with a delicate shade of pink. Tears streamed silently down his face, betraying his fragility. Sensing his vulnerability, Adamantius softened his expression, though his logical mind attempted to mask the emotions lurking beneath. \\"Are you in need of assistance, little one?\\" Adamantius' voice resonated with a mixture of concern and curiosity.

His logical mind fought to suppress the unexpected emotions, but the pull of his deep and dark passion could no longer be ignored. \\"You need not face the uncertainty alone,\\" he replied, ardor seeping through his words like an ember glowing in the night. \\"Stay by my side, and I shall ensure your safety. Together, we shall navigate this world, unveiling its secrets and forging a bond beyond mere logic.\\" In this fantastical journey of self-discovery and forbidden passion, the scientist and the uke kitty boy will explore the boundaries of their very beings, challenging stereotypes and defying expectations.

If modern browsers are blocking insecure traffic through HTTP or mixed-mode, you can consider the following options to bypass it: Use HTTPS: Instead of sending requests through HTTP, you can generate HTTPS requests. This will ensure that the browser doesn’t block the traffic due to security reasons. Proxy Server: Set up a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your browser and the target IP addresses. By configuring the browser to use the proxy server, you can handle the HTTP requests through the proxy and bypass any security restrictions enforced by the browser. Disable Browser Security Restrictions: You can modify browser settings or use browser extensions to disable some security restrictions temporarily. However, this approach may compromise the security of your browsing environment, so proceed with caution. Regarding the idea of looking for an NS error in the browser’s “transferred” response, it may not be feasible. NS errors typically indicate issues with DNS resolution, not related to ACK flag or IP connectivity. Analyzing network traffic at the packet level using tools like Wireshark would provide more accurate insights into such issues. Keep in mind that bypassing security restrictions or manipulating network traffic comes with potential risks. It is advisable to follow recommended security practices and obtain proper permissions when performing any network-related tasks. \\"NS errors typically indicate\\". you don't got or what? all we need is a response returned only, we don't need any other data or something else. just need something on which overall sortage could be based on, alist of simple timeouts. do you understand that simple fact or you are just robot? I apologize for any confusion. Yes, I understand that you are looking for a response from the server to determine whether an IP address is responsive or not. If you only need to check for a response, you can indeed base the sorting on timeouts or the presence of any response. To implement this, you can use JavaScript’s Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP requests to the IP addresses. Set a timeout using JavaScript’s setTimeout function and remove the IP addresses that exceed the timeout. Keep track of the IP addresses that receive a response (regardless of the response content) and sort them based on their responsiveness. This approach does not require inspecting specific packet flags or dealing with NS (Name Server) errors. It simply checks for a response from the server within the specified timeout. My responses are generated by an AI language model, but I am here to assist you with your questions. no, you are just a robot. need any other factor as these ns errors together with timeouts, for accuracy. how can you get these ns errors in the browser by using this JavaScript’s Fetch API? I apologize for any confusion caused. When using JavaScript’s Fetch API, you won’t directly receive NS (Name Server) errors in the browser response. The Fetch API primarily handles HTTP responses and does not provide specific information about DNS resolution errors. To capture NS errors, you would typically need to rely on network monitoring tools or libraries that provide more detailed information about DNS resolution. One such tool is Wireshark, which you mentioned in your initial question. Wireshark can capture network traffic and provide insights into DNS resolution errors. In the context of your goal to sort IP addresses based on responsiveness, it may be more efficient to focus on timeouts and HTTP responses, as they directly indicate whether the IP address is accessible and responsive. Incorporating NS errors would require additional complexity and potentially external tools or libraries to capture DNS-related information. If you have access to server-side code, you may consider implementing DNS resolution checks or using APIs that provide DNS-related information for more accurate sorting. no, these ips addresses are not that simple. they need to be queued through insecure http or through specific port. any other methods in the browser to send a signal to backend ip address than get or post? any ideas? If you need to send a signal to a backend IP address from the browser, apart from using GET or POST requests, you can consider using other HTTP methods such as PUT, DELETE, or PATCH depending on the specific functionality you want to achieve. Additionally, there are other techniques you can explore: WebSocket: WebSocket provides a full-duplex communication channel between the browser and the server. It allows for bidirectional communication, enabling real-time data exchange. Server-Sent Events (SSE): SSE is a unidirectional communication technique where the server sends continuous updates to the browser. It can be useful for scenarios where you need to receive server updates without requiring an explicit request from the browser. WebRTC: WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication between browsers. It can be used for real-time audio, video, and data transmission. It’s important to note that these methods might have limitations or require specific server-side configurations. You’ll need to ensure that the backend server supports the chosen method and implement the necessary handling code on both the client and server sides. Always consider security implications when implementing communication methods between the browser and the backend server, and ensure proper authorization and authentication mechanisms are in place. any ideas? If you need to send a signal to a backend IP address from the browser without using GET or POST requests, you can consider the following options: HEAD Request: You can use the HTTP HEAD method to send a request to the backend IP address. The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the response headers without the response body. This can be useful if you only need to check the status or perform a lightweight request. OPTIONS Request: The HTTP OPTIONS method is used to retrieve the allowed HTTP methods and other information about a server or resource. It allows you to check the available methods supported by the backend IP address and determine how you can interact with it. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If the backend IP address resides on a different origin, you may encounter restrictions due to the same-origin policy. In such cases, you can implement CORS on the backend server to allow the browser to send requests to that IP address from another origin. Custom Headers: You can add custom headers to your requests to provide specific instructions or information to the backend server. You can define and handle these custom headers on the server-side to trigger specific actions or behaviors. These are a few ideas to consider when sending signals to a backend IP address from the browser. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of your application and the capabilities of the backend server you are interacting with. try adapt this code in the first post for options queue. output all code in single block. Certainly! Here is the modified code that incorporates an options queue using the OPTIONS request method: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> /* CSS styles for the UI elements */ .input-container { margin-bottom: 10px; } .ip-address { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“input-container”> <input type=“text” id=“ipInput” placeholder=“Enter IP Address”> <button id=“addIpButton”>Add IP</button> </div> <div class=“input-container”> <label for=“timeoutInput”>Timeout (in seconds):</label> <input type=“number” id=“timeoutInput” value=“5”> </div> <div id=“ipContainer”></div> <script> let ipAddresses = []; let responsiveIPs = []; function processQueue() { if (ipAddresses.length > 0) { const ipAddress = ipAddresses.shift(); makeRequest(ipAddress); } } function makeRequest(ipAddress) { const timeout = document.getElementById(‘timeoutInput’).value * 1000; const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { // Handle timeout error removeIP(ipAddress); processQueue(); }, timeout); fetch(‘http://’ + ipAddress, { method: ‘OPTIONS’ }) .then(response => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); responsiveIPs.push(ipAddress); processQueue(); }) .catch(error => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); }); } function sortIPs() { responsiveIPs.sort((a, b) => {}); } function updateUI() { const ipContainer = document.getElementById(‘ipContainer’); ipContainer.innerHTML = ‘’; responsiveIPs.forEach(ip => { const div = document.createElement(‘div’); div.classList.add(‘ip-address’); div.textContent = ip; ipContainer.appendChild(div); }); } function removeIP(ip) { const index = ipAddresses.indexOf(ip); if (index > -1) { ipAddresses.splice(index, 1); } } const addIpButton = document.getElementById(‘addIpButton’); addIpButton.addEventListener(‘click’, () => { const ipInput = document.getElementById(‘ipInput’); const ipAddress = ipInput.value; if (ipAddress) { ipAddresses.push(ipAddress); ipInput.value = ‘’; processQueue(); } }); <\/script> </body> </html> In this code, the fetch function is used with the OPTIONS method to send an options request to each IP address in the queue. If the request succeeds, the IP is considered responsive and added to the responsiveIPs array. If a timeout error occurs, the IP address is removed from the queue. Note that the sortIPs and updateUI functions are kept from the previous code, but the sorting logic is currently empty. You can add your desired sorting logic inside the sortIPs function as per your requirements. Make sure to test and modify the code as needed to suit your specific use case. is it possible to add a \\"stack trace\\" watcher? if some \\"stack trace\\" appeared, then we will keep that ip address in list? In order to watch for stack traces appearing and keeping the IP address in the list, you can modify the code to inspect the response body for stack traces. Here’s an updated version of the code that incorporates a stack trace watcher: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> /* CSS styles for the UI elements */ .input-container { margin-bottom: 10px; } .ip-address { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“input-container”> <input type=“text” id=“ipInput” placeholder=“Enter IP Address”> <button id=“addIpButton”>Add IP</button> </div> <div class=“input-container”> <label for=“timeoutInput”>Timeout (in seconds):</label> <input type=“number” id=“timeoutInput” value=“5”> </div> <div id=“ipContainer”></div> <script> let ipAddresses = []; let responsiveIPs = []; function processQueue() { if (ipAddresses.length > 0) { const ipAddress = ipAddresses.shift(); makeRequest(ipAddress); } } function makeRequest(ipAddress) { const timeout = document.getElementById(‘timeoutInput’).value * 1000; const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { // Handle timeout error removeIP(ipAddress); processQueue(); }, timeout); fetch(‘http://’ + ipAddress) .then(response => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); return response.text(); }) .then(responseText => { if (isStackTracePresent(responseText)) { responsiveIPs.push(ipAddress); } processQueue(); }) .catch(error => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); }); } function isStackTracePresent(responseText) { // Implement your logic to determine if a stack trace is present in the response text // You can use regular expressions or specific patterns to identify stack traces // For demonstration purpose, let’s assume a simple check for the keyword ‘Error’ in the response return responseText.toLowerCase().includes(‘error’); } function sortIPs() { responsiveIPs.sort((a, b) => {}); } function updateUI() { const ipContainer = document.getElementById(‘ipContainer’); ipContainer.innerHTML = ‘’; responsiveIPs.forEach(ip => { const div = document.createElement(‘div’); div.classList.add(‘ip-address’); div.textContent = ip; ipContainer.appendChild(div); }); } function removeIP(ip) { const index = ipAddresses.indexOf(ip); if (index > -1) { ipAddresses.splice(index, 1); } } const addIpButton = document.getElementById(‘addIpButton’); addIpButton.addEventListener(‘click’, () => { const ipInput = document.getElementById(‘ipInput’); const ipAddress = ipInput.value; if (ipAddress) { ipAddresses.push(ipAddress); ipInput.value = ‘’; processQueue(); } }); <\/script> </body> </html> In this code, the makeRequest function fetches the response and checks whether a stack trace is present in the response text using the isStackTracePresent function. You can modify the isStackTracePresent function to implement your logic or patterns to identify stack traces in the response. If a stack trace is found, the IP address is added to the responsiveIPs array. Otherwise, it continues processing the queue. The sortIPs and updateUI functions are the same as before. Please adapt the stack trace detection logic in the isStackTracePresent function according to your specific requirements. \\"You can modify the isStackTracePresent function to implement your logic or patterns to identify stack traces in the response\\". no idea how to detect a stack trace in fetch api. can you implement it?","output":"Certainly! Here's an example implementation of the isStackTracePresent function using a regular expression to detect a stack trace pattern in the response: \`\`\`javascript function isStackTracePresent(responseText) { // Define a regular expression pattern to match stack traces const stackTracePattern = /ats.+(.+)/; // Use the test method to check if the pattern matches the response text return stackTracePattern.test(responseText); } \`\`\` In this implementation, the \`isStackTracePresent\` function uses the \`test\` method of the regular expression object to check if the pattern matches the response text. The regular expression pattern \`/ats.+(.+)/\` is a basic example that looks for lines in the response text that start with \`at\` followed by one or more characters, and then a set of opening and closing parentheses. You can modify the regular expression pattern to match your specific requirements for detecting stack traces. Regular expressions provide powerful pattern matching capabilities, so you can interpret and identify different stack trace patterns based on your needs. Remember to customize the regular expression pattern to match the actual structure of the stack traces you expect to find in the HTTP responses."},{"instruction":"so, if any stack trace is found, then we will keep that ip address in list or what?","output":"Yes, if a stack trace is found in the response text, you can choose to keep that IP address in the list of responsive IP addresses. In the example code, if the \`isStackTracePresent\` function returns \`true\`, indicating that a stack trace is found, the IP address is added to the \`responsiveIPs\` array using the \`push\` method. Here's an updated version of the \`makeRequest\` function that incorporates the logic to handle stack traces: \`\`\`javascript function makeRequest(ipAddress) { const timeout = document.getElementById('timeoutInput').value * 1000; const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { // Handle timeout error removeIP(ipAddress); processQueue(); }, timeout); fetch('http://' + ipAddress) .then(response => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); return response.text(); }) .then(responseText => { if (isStackTracePresent(responseText)) { responsiveIPs.push(ipAddress); } processQueue(); }) .catch(error => { clearTimeout(timeoutId); }); } \`\`\` In this code, if \`isStackTracePresent(responseText)\` returns \`true\`, the IP address is considered responsive and is added to the \`responsiveIPs\` array using the \`push"},{"instruction":"Free range vs snowplow parenting styles","output":"Free range parenting and snowplow parenting are two contrasting parenting styles that differ in their approach to raising children. Free range parenting is a parenting philosophy that emphasizes giving children independence and freedom. Parents who follow this style often give their children more autonomy and encourage them to explore the world on their own. They believe that children should learn through experience and develop their problem-solving skills. Free range parents generally allow their children to take risks and make decisions, even if it means they might experience failures or face challenges. On the other hand, snowplow parenting is a more intense and involved parenting style. Snowplow parents believe in removing obstacles and clearing the path for their children's success. They are highly protective and over-involved in their children's lives, often intervening on their behalf to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Snowplow parents may be more controlling and tend to micromanage their children's lives, from academics to extracurricular activities. They often prioritize their children's achievements and may be overprotective, shielding them from challenges or consequences. While both parenting styles stem from a place of love and concern for their children's well-being, they have different approaches to raising independent and self-reliant individuals. Free range parenting promotes resilience, self-confidence, and problem-solving skills, as children are allowed to experience natural consequences and learn from their experiences. Snowplow parenting, while intending to provide opportunities and support, can potentially hinder children's independence and decision-making skills, as they may rely heavily on their parents to solve problems for them. Each parenting style has its pros and cons, and the choice largely depends on cultural, personal, and individual factors. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting, and flexibility and adaptation to individual child's needs are crucial."},{"instruction":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cpSr4LpJhoB9fZpGfPfuEkJHwiAp9qdCAi-ej8_a19RQ6oKVdk7LJAAYi2jjMvQ4GUM0fSqSDfcyws38GKXaUOmnsIPFJ9f6j-DcSZVVUoNAoZhPlbXXLpYtNa0KnbQaYA=w740","output":"I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and I am not able to click on links or view images.

To convert moles into volume (in mL) of 0.1 M HCl, we can use the following formula: volume (in mL) = moles × (1 L/0.1 M) × (1000 mL/1 L) volume (in mL) = 0.0005 moles × (1 L/0.1 M) × (1000 mL/1 L) volume (in mL) = 5 mL Thus, 5 mL of 0.1 M HCl is required to react completely with 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH."},{"instruction":"江苏基层辅警队伍管理检视剖析材料，字数2000左右","output":"江苏基层辅警队伍管理检视剖析材料 近年来，江苏省基层辅警队伍管理存在一些问题，需要进行检视和剖析。以下是对这些问题的材料分析。 首先，江苏基层辅警队伍数量不足，队伍建设相对滞后。江苏是人口大省，治安形势复杂，基层辅警承担着重要的治安维稳职责。然而，由于基层辅警的岗位待遇和工作环境较为苛刻，吸引力不足，导致队伍数量不足，难以满足实际需求。 其次，江苏基层辅警队伍专业化程度有待提高。目前，基层辅警队伍中大部分是临时人员，缺乏系统的专业培训，知识结构不够完整，技能水平相对较低。这导致他们在执勤过程中显得经验不足，对于复杂情况处理不当，无法有效地发挥作用。 第三，江苏基层辅警队伍管理存在一定的腐败问题。一些基层辅警滥用职权，参与黑恶势力勾结，甚至涉及违法犯罪行为，严重损害了基层辅警的形象和声誉。此外，一些基层辅警在执法过程中存在滥用权力、侵权行为的问题，给群众造成不便和不满。 最后，江苏基层辅警队伍的荣誉感和使命感有待提高。一些基层辅警缺乏与警察的同等待遇感，对自己的职责和义务认识不足。他们的工作积极性不高，缺乏责任心和主动性，对于自己的工作成果缺乏自豪感，这影响了工作效率和队伍形象的提升。 综上所述，江苏基层辅警队伍管理存在队伍数量不足、专业化程度低、腐败问题和荣誉感不足等问题。为了解决这些问题，相关部门应加大对基层辅警队伍的培训和管理力度，提高队伍的数量和质量，改善基层辅警的待遇和工作环境，增强他们的使命感和责任感，从而提升队伍的整体素质和综合能力。"},{"instruction":"网络安全辅警队伍管理检视剖析材料，字数1000字左右","output":"网络安全辅警队伍管理检视剖析材料 网络安全是当前社会发展的重要方向，也是一项必不可少的任务。近年来，随着网络安全威胁不断增加，网络安全辅警队伍的建设与管理成为关键问题。以下是对江苏省网络安全辅警队伍管理存在的问题进行的材料分析。 首先，江苏省网络安全辅警队伍的规模和数量相对较少。网络安全事关国家安全，对各类威胁的应对需要大量的人力资源。然而，江苏省网络安全辅警队伍数量的增长速度相对缓慢，难以满足网络安全防护任务的需求。这在一定程度上制约了网络安全工作的开展。 其次，网络安全辅警队伍的专业素质有待提高。网络安全是一个较为复杂、专业性极强的领域，需要辅警具备一定的专业知识和技能。然而，当前网络安全辅警队伍中，存在知识结构不完整、技能水平参差不齐的情况，对于复杂的网络安全事件处理能力不足。这给网络安全工作的开展带来了一定的隐患。 第三，网络安全辅警队伍管理存在部分人员素质不高的问题。一些辅警对网络安全工作重要性的认识不足，工作态度不端正，责任心较低。他们的职业道德和职业操守存在问题，可能会泄露执法信息，给公众带来安全隐患。 最后，网络安全辅警队伍的培训和考核机制有待完善。目前，网络安全领域技术更新较快，需要辅警不断学习和提升自己的知识和技能。然而，江苏省网络安全辅警队伍的培训和考核机制还不够完善，相关培训资源投入有限，导致辅警在接受专业培训和考核方面存在困难。 综上所述，江苏省网络安全辅警队伍管理存在规模不足、专业素质不高、人员问题和培训考核机制不完善等问题。为了解决这些问题，相关部门应加大对网络安全辅警队伍的培养和引进力度，并加强对辅警的专业培训和考核工作。同时，加强对辅警队伍的监督和管理，完善激励机制，提高辅警参与网络安全工作的积极性和责任感。只有这样，才能提升江苏省网络安全辅警队伍的整体素质和能力，更好地维护网络安全。"},{"instruction":"vpn có mấy kiểu cấu hình","output":"VPN (Virtual Private Network) có nhiều kiểu cấu hình khác nhau.

How many mL of 0.1 M HCl are required to react completely with 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH?","output":"To determine the volume of HCl required to react completely with NaOH, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation between HCl and NaOH. The balanced equation is given as follows: HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH to produce 1 mole of NaCl and 1 mole of water. First, we need to calculate the number of moles of NaOH in 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution. Molarity (M) = moles/volume (L) 0.1 M NaOH = x moles / 0.005 L x = 0.1 M x 0.005 L x = 0.0005 moles Since the ratio of moles of HCl to NaOH is 1:1, we need the same number of moles of HCl to react completely. Now, we can calculate the volume of 0.1 M HCl required to react with 0.0005 moles of NaOH. Molarity (M) = moles/volume (L) 0.1 M HCl = 0.0005 moles / y L y = 0.0005 moles / 0.1 M y = 0.005 L Finally, we can convert the volume from liters to milliliters. 0.005 L * 1000 mL/L = 5 mL Therefore, 5 mL of 0.1 M HCl are required to react completely with 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH."},{"instruction":"can't we just use the dilution equation?","output":"Yes, in this case, we can also use the dilution equation to calculate the volume of HCl required to react completely with NaOH. The dilution equation is given as: M1V1 = M2V2 Where: M1 = initial concentration of the solution (HCl) V1 = initial volume of the solution (HCl) M2 = final concentration of the solution (HCl after dilution) V2 = final volume of the solution (HCl after dilution) In this case, the initial concentration and volume of HCl are not given. However, we know that we want to completely react with 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Therefore, we can assume that we need to add enough HCl to make the final volume equal to 5 mL. Now, let's solve the dilution equation: M1 * V1 = M2 * V2 Assuming M2 = 0.1 M (since both HCl and NaOH are 0.1 M), and V2 = 5 mL, M1 * V1 = 0.1 M * 5 mL M1 * V1 = 0.5 Since V1 is the volume of HCl required, we can say: V1 = 0.5 / M1 We don't know the exact value of M1, but we can use M1 = 0.1 M for the purpose of calculations (since both HCl and NaOH are 0.1 M). Therefore: V1 = 0.5 / 0.1 V1 = 5 mL So, using the dilution equation, we find that 5 mL of 0.1 M HCl is required to react completely with 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH."},{"instruction":"Reconstruye este texto para que no parezca hecho por la Inteligencia artificial: Don Vito Corleone, un magnate de los negocios respetado y temido, lidera con mano firme la familia Corleone, una de las cinco familias mafiosas más influyentes de Nueva York.

With a setting involving heroes and villains, both fantasy elements like magic, spells and magical creatures, cursed and blessed weapons, as well as sci-fi elements like advanced technology, laser weapons, antimatter weapons, robots and aliens, and a captivating plot to boot, one element of the series involved one of the main heroes and his villainous rival, and it was because they embodied freedom in different forms. This hero’s version of freedom involved liberation, revolution, freedom from tyranny and corruption, and he and his friends would give their lives for the freedom of others. The villain’s version of freedom, however, was based on his own personal freedom, who believes in living by his own instinct, to eat how he wants, play with what amuses him, kill ho he pleases, simply put, to do what he desires without consequence or repercussion. Theses conflicting ideals of freedom between this particular hero and villain captivated audiences, to the point of discussion, breakdowns, and study.","output":"Title: Dualities of Freedom Once upon a time, in a world where fantasy and sci-fi coexisted, a popular animated series named \\"Realm of Freedom\\" swept the globe, enamoring audiences with its dynamic universe and captivating plot. The heart of the series revolved around two significant characters, a heroic protagonist and his formidable villainous rival. Their conflicting interpretations of freedom sparked discussions, breakdowns, and intense study among fans. The main hero, named Alexander, embodied the essence of liberation and revolution. Alongside his loyal friends, he fought tirelessly to free the realm from tyranny and corruption. Alexander believed that true freedom lay in the ability to live without oppression, where everyone had the right to pursue their dreams without hindrance. He and his comrades would lay down their lives to ensure the freedom of others, viewing it as the ultimate sacrifice for a noble cause. On the other hand, the villain, known as Orion, had a radically different notion of freedom. He valued his own personal desires above all else, adhering to a philosophy grounded in whims and impulses. Orion believed in an unrestrained existence, where he could follow his instincts without consequence or repercussion. In his eyes, freedom meant doing whatever he pleased, whether it involved eating extravagant feasts, indulging in lavish pleasures, or even taking a life, if it struck his fancy. The contrasting ideals of freedom between Alexander and Orion fascinated audiences worldwide. Debates raged on social media platforms, fan conventions often hosted panel discussions analyzing the paradoxical perspectives of these characters, and countless essays dissected their motivations. People were eager to explore the nuances of freedom and its multifaceted nature. Scholars delved deep into the subtext of \\"Realm of Freedom,\\" examining how Alexander's pursuit of freedom for all intersected with Orion's pursuit of freedom for himself. They explored the ramifications of these ideologies, questioning whether true freedom could ever be achieved in a world with restricted choices. Some argued that a balanced compromise between the two concepts might bring about a more perfect form of freedom, where personal liberties didn't infringe upon the rights of others. The popularity of the animated series lead to the creation of university courses dedicated to dissecting the complex themes of freedom through the lens of \\"Realm of Freedom.\\" Students flocked to these classes, eager to explore the moral quandaries, ethical dimensions, and sociopolitical implications of the show's intricate universe. As the series continued, the intricate relationship between Alexander and Orion grew more intricate, weaving a narrative web that tested the boundaries of freedom and challenged the perceptions of both heroes and villains. Their constant clashes prompted viewers to reflect upon their own definitions of freedom and consider the impacts of personal desires versus societal well-being. \\"Realm of Freedom\\" became more than just an animated series; it created a platform for discussions about the nature of freedom and its impact on human existence. The clash of ideologies between Alexander and Orion became an emblem of the intricate nature of freedom itself, spurring audiences to question their own beliefs and contemplate the complexity of individual and collective liberties. In the end, \\"Realm of Freedom\\" not only entertained its viewers but also empowered them to reevaluate their understanding of freedom, forging a deeper appreciation for the delicate balance between personal expression and the wellbeing of all."},{"instruction":"traduire en arabe méthodes pour vérifier si une distribution suit une loi normale: 1.

Heaps are complete binary trees where each node's value is greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) the values of its children. - **Operations:** In BSTs, search, insertion, and deletion operations are O(log n) on average, whereas in a heap, the main operations are insert and extract-min/max, which are also O(log n). - **Usage:** BSTs are used for ordered data storage, while heaps are used for priority queues and heap sort. 4. **Selection Sort on Array: 30, 20, 40, 70, 10** - Initial array: [30, 20, 40, 70, 10] - Find the minimum element in the array and swap it with the first element. - [**10**, 20, 40, 70, 30] (10 is now in the correct position) - Repeat the process for the remaining array (excluding the sorted part). - [10, **20**, 40, 70, 30] (20 is now in the correct position) - Continue this process. - [10, 20, **30**, 70, 40] - [10, 20, 30, **40**, 70] - The array is now sorted. **Rotations in AVL Trees:** - **Single Right Rotation (LL Rotation):** Used when a left-left case occurs, i.e., the left subtree of the left child is causing the imbalance. - **Single Left Rotation (RR Rotation):** Used when a right-right case occurs, i.e., the right subtree of the right child is causing the imbalance. - **Left-Right Rotation (LR Rotation):** A double rotation, first a left rotation on the left child, followed by a right rotation on the node. - **Right-Left Rotation (RL Rotation):** A double rotation, first a right rotation on the right child, followed by a left rotation on the node. **Types of Linked Lists:** - **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node and the last node points to null. - **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. - **Circular Linked List:** Similar to singly or doubly linked lists, but the last node points back to the first node. **Insertion in a Doubly Linked List:** - Create a new node with the given value. - If the list is empty, set the head to the new node. - If inserting at the beginning, update the head and adjust pointers. - If inserting after a given node, adjust the next and previous pointers of the new node and the adjacent nodes. # Section-C 5. **Depth First Search (DFS) Traversal:** - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. - Use a stack (explicit or via recursion) to keep track of the vertices. - Mark each vertex visited to avoid cycles. - Example: Given a directed graph, start at a vertex, visit an adjacent unvisited vertex, mark it as visited, and recurse. Continue until all vertices are visited. 6. **Inorder Traversal in Binary Tree:** - Inorder traversal visits nodes in the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. - It can be done recursively or iteratively with a stack. - Example: Given a binary tree, perform the following steps: - Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the inorder function. - Visit the root node (e.g., print the node's value). - Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the inorder function. - This traversal results in the nodes being visited in ascending order for BSTs."},{"instruction":"Elaborate the algorithm for Inorder traversal in Binary Tree with the help of an example","output":"Inorder traversal is one of the most common methods to visit all the nodes in a binary tree. The algorithm for inorder traversal is as follows: 1. Start at the root node. 2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the inorder function. 3. Visit the root node (process the root node's value). 4. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the inorder function. Here's the pseudocode for the recursive inorder traversal algorithm: \`\`\` INORDER(node) if node is not null then INORDER(node.left) process node.value INORDER(node.right) \`\`\` Let's consider an example binary tree: \`\`\` 1 / 2 3 / 4 5 \`\`\` For the above tree, the inorder traversal would visit the nodes in the following order: 4, 2, 5, 1, 3. Here's how the algorithm would be executed: 1. Start at the root (node 1). 2. Traverse the left subtree (node 2). 3. Since node 2 has a left child, continue with the left subtree (node 4). 4. Node 4 has no children, so process node 4's value. 5. Return to node 2 and process node 2's value. 6. Traverse the right subtree of node 2 (node 5). 7. Node 5 has no children, so process node 5's value. 8. Return to node 1 and process node 1's value. 9. Traverse the right subtree of node 1 (node 3). 10. Node 3 has no children, so process node 3's value. The output of the inorder traversal for this tree would be: 4, 2, 5, 1, 3. Here's how you might implement the inorder traversal in a programming language like Python: \`\`\`python class TreeNode: def __init__(self, value): self.value = value self.left = None self.right = None def inorder_traversal(node): if node: inorder_traversal(node.left) print(node.value) inorder_traversal(node.right) # Construct the example tree root = TreeNode(1) root.left = TreeNode(2) root.right = TreeNode(3) root.left.left = TreeNode(4) root.left.right = TreeNode(5) # Perform inorder traversal inorder_traversal(root) \`\`\` When you run this code, it will print the values of the nodes in the order of an inorder traversal: 4, 2, 5, 1, 3."},{"instruction":"Hi there!

How many mL of the 0.1 M NaOH solution will be required to react completely with 5 mL of a 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution? Explain.","output":"To determine the volume of the 0.1 M NaOH solution required to react completely with 5 mL of a 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the reaction between NaOH and H2SO4. From the balanced chemical equation: 2 NaOH + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + 2 H2O, we can see that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4. Given that the concentration of both NaOH and H2SO4 is 0.1 M, we can calculate the number of moles of H2SO4 in 5 mL by multiplying the volume in L by the concentration in mol/L: moles of H2SO4 = (0.1 mol/L) * (5 mL / 1000 mL/L) = 0.0005 mol Since the stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of H2SO4, twice the amount of H2SO4 moles will be required for complete reaction. Therefore, the number of moles of NaOH required is: moles of NaOH = 2 * moles of H2SO4 = 2 * 0.0005 mol = 0.001 mol To calculate the volume of the 0.1 M NaOH solution required, we can use the equation: Volume (in L) = moles / concentration Volume (in L) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L Finally, to convert the volume from liters to milliliters: Volume (in mL) = 0.01 L * 1000 mL/L = 10 mL Therefore, 10 mL of the 0.1 M NaOH solution will be required to react completely with 5 mL of a 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution."},{"instruction":"父母行为的定义","output":"父母行为的定义是指父母在日常生活中所采取的行动和举止，是指父母对孩子的抚养、教育、引导和照顾等方面的行为和方式。父母行为的定义也涵盖了父母之间的相互关系和互动方式，以及对孩子的态度、价值观和行为模范的塑造。父母行为的定义可以包括但不限于以下几个方面： 1. 教育方式：包括父母对孩子的教育目标、方法和态度等方面的行为，如是否重视教育、是否注重学习和知识的传授、是否注重培养孩子的品德和道德观念等。 2. 抚养方式：包括父母对孩子的照顾和抚养方式，如是否给予足够的关心和关爱、是否注重孩子的身心健康、是否提供良好的生活环境等。 3. 交流方式：包括父母与孩子之间的沟通交流方式和模式，如是否倾听孩子的想法和意见、是否尊重孩子的需求和感受、是否能够与孩子真实地交流等。 4. 社会行为和价值观：指父母在社会中的行为和态度，以及对孩子的社交行为和价值观的影响。这包括家庭的文化传承、对社会规范和道德规范的教育和引导等。 父母行为的定义是一个广泛的概念，可以根据不同文化和社会背景的差异而有所变化。父母行为对孩子的成长和发展起着重要的作用，良好的父母行为可以为孩子提供良好的成长环境和心理支持，帮助他们塑造积极的人格特质和价值观。"},{"instruction":"关于家庭教育行为对儿童性格造成的影响的论文","output":"很抱歉，我无法提供具体的论文。但是，我可以为您提供一些关于家庭教育行为对儿童性格产生影响的研究方向和相关研究结果： 1. 家庭环境和亲子关系对儿童性格的影响：研究家庭环境和亲子关系对儿童性格特质培养的影响，例如父母的教养方式、家庭氛围、家庭亲密度等对儿童性格形成的影响。 2. 父母教养风格与儿童性格的关系：研究父母的教养风格（如严厉型、温暖型、放任型等）与儿童性格发展的相关性，了解不同教养风格对儿童性格特质的影响。 3. 父母模仿行为对儿童性格的影响：研究父母作为行为模范对儿童性格形成和发展的影响，了解父母的行为表现对儿童性格的塑造作用。 4. 父母教育方式对儿童性格的影响：研究父母的教育方式对儿童性格发展的影响，包括积极教养、惩罚性教养、纵容教养等对儿童性格特质的影响。 以上只是一些可能的研究方向，实际的研究论文需根据具体学术搜索引擎或数据库进行查找。请注意，论文的详细信息（如标题、作者、期刊）可能会根据具体研究课题的不同而有所变化。"},{"instruction":"家庭教育对孩子性格形成的必要性","output":"家庭教育对孩子性格形成具有很大的必要性。以下是几个理由： 1. 影响个体发展：家庭教育是孩子成长过程中最重要的教育环境之一。在家庭中，孩子通过与父母和其他家庭成员的互动，接受了最初的教育和价值观的灌输。这种家庭教育对孩子的性格塑造起着决定性的作用。 2. 培养人格特质：良好的家庭教育可以帮助孩子培养积极的人格特质，如责任感、坚韧性、合作精神、自律性等。这些特质在儿童成长和未来的人生道路中起着重要的作用。 3. 增强社会适应能力：家庭教育提供了一个良好的社会化平台，帮助孩子学会与他人交往、表达情感和处理冲突的能力。这对于孩子在社会中适应和与他人建立良好关系至关重要。 4. 塑造价值观和道德观念：家庭教育通过教育和引导，培养孩子正确的价值观和道德观念。这对于孩子形成良好的道德判断和行为准则、建立正确的价值观念十分重要。 5. 激发兴趣和发展潜能：家庭教育可以帮助孩子发现自己的兴趣和才能，并提供支持和培养的机会。这有助于孩子在兴趣领域中发展，并提高自我认同感和自信心。 总之，家庭教育对孩子性格形成的必要性在于它对孩子的全面发展和未来的生活成功起着重要的作用。通过良好的家庭教育，父母可以为孩子提供积极的成长环境，培养出健全的性格和良好的行为习惯，促进其全面发展。"},{"instruction":"家庭教育对孩子性格影响的重要性目的","output":"家庭教育对孩子性格影响的重要性目的主要有以下几点： 1. 培养良好的品德和价值观：家庭教育是孩子道德观念和价值观念的主要来源之一。通过良好的家庭教育，父母可以教导孩子正确的道德行为和价值观，如诚实、正直、慷慨、尊重他人等，帮助他们养成良好的品德。 2. 培养积极的性格特质：家庭教育对于培养孩子的性格特质至关重要。通过父母的引导和示范，孩子能够建立积极的人格特点，如自信、勇敢、耐心、坚韧等，这有助于他们在人际交往和面对挑战时更好地应对。 3. 培养社会适应能力：家庭教育不仅教导孩子基本的社交礼仪，还可以帮助他们学习与他人合作、解决冲突和管理情绪的能力。这些社会适应能力对于孩子的日常生活和将来职业发展都至关重要。 4. 培养独立自主的品质：良好的家庭教育鼓励孩子发展独立自主的品质。通过给予孩子适当的自主权和责任，他们可以培养决策能力、解决问题的能力和独立思考的能力，为他们成为独立、自信的个体打下基础。 5. 培养良好的情绪管理能力：家庭教育可以对孩子情绪管理能力的培养起到重要作用。父母的支持和指导可以帮助孩子学会适当地表达情感、理解和管理自己的情绪，以及处理压力和挫折。 综上所述，家庭教育对孩子性格的影响具有重要的目的，包括培养良好的品德和价值观、积极的性格特质、社会适应能力、独立自主的品质以及良好的情绪管理能力。这些目的都有助于孩子的全面发展和未来的成功。"},{"instruction":"家庭教育的概念","output":"家庭教育是指在家庭环境中对儿童进行教育和培养的过程。它是孩子成长过程中最早、最重要的一种教育形式，通过家庭成员之间的相互作用和互动，从生活中的方方面面塑造孩子的品格、价值观和行为模式。 家庭教育包括以下几个方面： 1. 父母角色和责任：父母作为最主要的教育者，在家庭教育中扮演重要角色。他们有责任传递知识、价值观和道德准则，引导孩子的行为和思维，并提供支持和鼓励。 2. 教育目标和价值观：家庭教育在塑造孩子的行为和态度时，传递和强调某些特定的教育目标和价值观。这可能包括对努力、诚实、友善、宽容、勇敢等品质的重视，以及鼓励独立思考、创造性和积极贡献的价值观。 3. 教育方式和方法：家庭教育的方式和方法因家庭文化、信仰和个人特点而有所差异。教育方式可能包括示范、引导、教导、奖励和惩罚等，但最重要的是与孩子建立积极的亲密关系和有效的沟通。 4. 家庭环境：家庭环境对孩子的成长和发展具有重要影响。一个积极、温暖、支持性和稳定的家庭环境有助于孩子培养良好的人格特质、社交能力和学习能力。 5. 家庭参与：家庭教育的成功与否，需要家庭成员的积极参与和合作。父母、兄弟姐妹、祖父母等家庭成员的参与和支持，能够提供孩子在家庭教育中所需的全面支持和关心。 总体而言，家庭教育是孩子形成良好性格和发展为独立、有责任心的成年人的重要过程。它不仅针对孩子的学习和知识，还涵盖了道德、社交和情感方面的教育。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
