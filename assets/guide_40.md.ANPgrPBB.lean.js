The profit share of a partner is directly proportional to the product of the investment and the time period for which the money is invested. So, Raman's share of profit = x * 12 (since he invests for the whole year) Lakshmi's share of profit = 2x * 6 Muthu's share of profit = 3x * 4 The ratio of their profits will be: Raman : Lakshmi : Muthu = (x * 12) : (2x * 6) : (3x * 4) Simplifying the ratio by dividing each term by x, we get: Raman : Lakshmi : Muthu = 12 : 12 : 12 This shows that all three partners have an equal share in the profit. Since Lakshmi's share is Rs. 12000, the total annual gain of the partnership will be three times Lakshmi's share (because all shares are equal). Total annual gain = Lakshmi's share * 3 Total annual gain = Rs. 12000 * 3 Total annual gain = Rs. 36000 Therefore, the total annual gain of the partnership is Rs. boxed{36000} ."},{"instruction":"Determine the exact value of the series [frac{1}{3 + 1} + frac{2}{3^2 + 1} + frac{4}{3^4 + 1} + frac{8}{3^8 + 1} + frac{16}{3^{16} + 1} + dotsb.]","output":"We apply a similar method as the initial problem, hoping for a telescoping series.

By rearranging, we can see that when y=0, x=-2. This means the point (-2,0) lies on the line. Since the equation of the circle is x^{2}+y^{2}=4, substituting x=-2 and y=0 into this equation shows that (-2,0) also lies on the circle. Thus, we can assume point A to be (-2,0), and since it's on the circle centered at the origin with radius 2, we have |OA|=2. 2. **Calculate the Area of Triangle ABO**: The problem states that the area of triangle ABO is 2. The formula for the area of a triangle when the base is |OA| (which is 2) and the height is the perpendicular distance from B to the x-axis (let's denote this distance as h) is frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times h = h. For the area to be 2, we need h=2. 3. **Determine the Coordinates of Point B**: Since the distance from point B to the x-axis is 2, and point B lies on the circle odot O with equation x^{2}+y^{2}=4, the y-coordinate of B must be 2 or -2 (to satisfy the distance requirement and still be on the circle). This gives us two possibilities for B: either B(0,2) or B(0,-2). 4. **Find the Value of m**: Substituting the coordinates of points B(0,2) and B(0,-2) into the line equation x-my+2=0, we solve for m in each case. For B(0,2), substituting x=0 and y=2 gives 0-2m+2=0, which simplifies to m=1. For B(0,-2), substituting x=0 and y=-2 gives 0+2m+2=0, which simplifies to m=-1.

Therefore, at least one of (x = 2), (y = 4), or (z = 6) must hold. 5. **Implication of one variable being fixed:**    If (x = 2), substituting into the first equation:    [    2^3 = 3 cdot 2 - 12y + 50 implies 8 = 6 - 12y + 50 implies -12y = -48 implies y = 4.    ]    Substituting (y = 4) into the second equation:    [    4^3 = 12 cdot 4 + 3z - 2 implies 64 = 48 + 3z - 2 implies 3z = 18 implies z = 6.    ]    Thus, (x = 2), (y = 4), and (z = 6) is the only solution.

The product of the numbers was calculated for each group, and then the sum of the digits of each of the 18 resulting products was calculated. Can all the resulting sums of digits be equal?","output":"1. **Understand the Problem:**    We have the first 72 consecutive natural numbers and we split them into 18 groups of 4 numbers each. For each group of 4 numbers, we calculate the product of those numbers and then sum the digits of the resulting product. We need to determine if all these digit sums can be equal. 2. **Observe the Divisibility Properties:**    If we assume that the sums of the digits of the products of the numbers in each of these 18 groups can be equal, consider the distribution of numbers concerning their divisibility by 9. 3. **Divisibility by 9:**    Among the first 72 natural numbers, there are 8 numbers that are divisible by 9. Specifically, these numbers are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, and 72.         Additionally, there are numbers divisible by 3 but not by 9. These numbers amount to 16 within the first 72 natural numbers because every 3rd number up to 72 is divisible by 3, and excluding the multiples of 9 (which are already counted). 4. **Compose the Groups:**    Now, consider any group of 4 numbers:    - For the product of the 4 numbers to be divisible by 9, you need either at least one number to be a multiple of 9 or at least two numbers to be multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9 (since ( 3 times 3 = 9 )).     5. **Classify the Groups:**    - A group of the first type has at least one number divisible by 9.    - A group of the second type has at least two numbers divisible by 3 but not 9. 6. **Count the Fit Groups:**    - **Type 1 groups**: With exactly 8 numbers divisible by 9 and each contributing to a different group, we can form exactly 8 groups with these numbers.    - **Type 2 groups**: We have 16 other numbers divisible by 3 but not 9. For groups formed with these, every combination of 2 out of these 16 numbers can form a valid group, i.e., ( frac{16}{2} = 8 ) additional groups. 7. **Summarize and Conclude:**    There are only enough to compose at most 8 groups of each type, which is ( 8 + 8 = 16 ) groups in total. We have more groups to account for (18 groups), but not enough numbers meeting the divisibility conditions. Thus, it is impossible to distribute the sums of digits of the products uniformly across all groups since all criteria cannot be met for all groups simultaneously. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The sums of the digits from all groups' products cannot all be equal.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Jessie won 3 times as many athletic awards as his buddy Scott.

Since there are 4 weeks, and each week has 1 Monday and 1 Wednesday, there are a total of 4 Mondays and 4 Wednesdays in 4 weeks. On each of these days, she eats 2 candies, so for each week, she eats: 2 candies/day * 2 days/week = 4 candies/week Since there are 4 weeks, she eats: 4 candies/week * 4 weeks = 16 candies in 4 weeks on Mondays and Wednesdays. Now, let's subtract the number of candies eaten on Mondays and Wednesdays from the total number of candies to find out how many candies are left for the other days of the week. 36 total candies - 16 candies (Mondays and Wednesdays) = 20 candies left for the other days. There are 5 other days in the week (Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), so in 4 weeks, there are: 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days Since Lisa eats all the remaining 20 candies over the course of these 20 days, she eats: 20 candies / 20 days = 1 candy/day Therefore, Lisa eats boxed{1}  candy on each of the other days of the week."},{"instruction":"4 hours 35 minutes =     minutes   4 tons 35 kilograms =     kilograms   678 seconds =     minutes     seconds   120000 square meters =     hectares.","output":"To convert 4 hours 35 minutes into minutes, multiply 4 by the conversion rate of 60, then add 35;   To convert 4 tons 35 kilograms into kilograms, multiply 4 by the conversion rate of 1000, then add 35;   To convert 678 seconds into a compound number, divide 678 by the conversion rate of 60, the quotient is the number of minutes, and the remainder is the number of seconds;   To convert 120000 square meters into hectares, divide 120000 by the conversion rate of 10000; thus, the solutions can be obtained. - For 4 hours 35 minutes, we have 4 times 60 + 35 = 275, so the answer is boxed{275} minutes. - For 4 tons 35 kilograms, we have 4 times 1000 + 35 = 4035, so the answer is boxed{4035} kilograms. - For 678 seconds, dividing by 60 gives 678 div 60 = 11 remainder 18, so the answer is boxed{11} minutes boxed{18} seconds. - For 120000 square meters, dividing by 10000 gives 120000 div 10000 = 12, so the answer is boxed{12} hectares."},{"instruction":"Mr. Llesis bought 50 kilograms of rice at different prices per kilogram.

To establish the similarity of these triangles, we demonstrate that they share two equal angles.            - Notice that ( angle MNA ) is common to both triangles ( triangle MPA ) and ( triangle MNA ).      - Since lines ( AB ) and ( MN ) are parallel, and ( NA ) intersects them creating alternate interior angles, we have ( angle MPA = angle MNA ).      Hence, ( triangle MPA sim triangle MNA ) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. 4. **Similar Argument for Triangle ( triangle MQB ):**    - Similarly, consider ( triangle MQB ) and ( triangle MNB ).      - They share angle ( angle MNB ).      - Because ( AB parallel MN ), we also have ( angle MQB = angle MNB ).      Hence, ( triangle MQB sim triangle MNB ) by the AA similarity criterion. 5. **Using the Similarity of Triangles:**    - Since ( triangle MPA sim triangle MNA ), the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal:      [      frac{MP}{MN} = frac{MA}{MA} rightarrow MP = k cdot MN      ]    where ( k ) is a constant that depends on the specific triangles.    - Similarly, from ( triangle MQB sim triangle MNB ), we have:      [      frac{MQ}{MN} = frac{MB}{MB} rightarrow MQ = k' cdot MN      ]    where ( k' ) is another constant that depends on the specific triangles. 6. **Proving the Product Is Constant:**    - The product of the segments on the tangent, ( MP cdot MQ ), can now be expressed using the ratios from the similar triangles:      [      MP cdot MQ = (k cdot MN)cdot (k' cdot MN) = (k cdot k') cdot MN^2      ]          We need to show that ( k cdot k' ) is constant regardless of the chord ( AB ). 7. **Conclusion:**    - The constants ( k ) and ( k' ) result from the similarity ratios, which do not depend on the position of ( P ) and ( Q ) since they are determined by geometric properties that hold for any chord parallel to ( MN ).    - Therefore, ( k cdot k' ) is constant, and consequently, ( MP cdot MQ = MN^2 ), showing that the product is indeed independent of the chosen parallel chord ( AB ).

Since the third circle is tangent to both the first and second circles, and also to the tangent line at ( S ), the distances from ( R ) to the tangent line and each circle’s center minus their radii must be equal (all equal to ( r )).

Since the transformations have maintained the property that: [ a + 2b equiv 0 pmod{19} quad text{(before hitting 19)} ] Considering N' = 19 equiv 0 pmod{19}, this implies the initial number N should also adhere to the property of divisibility by 19. # Conclusion: By mathematical induction via transformation, this proves that the original number is divisible by 19 if and only if, after applying the transformation multiple times, the final resulting number is exactly 19.

Show that they have a common tangent, and that the secondary tangents drawn from any point on this common tangent to the two parabolas are perpendicular to each other.","output":"1. **Define the Parabolas**:    We will position our coordinate system such that the origin is at the common focus of both parabolas, and the axis of the first parabola lies on the y-axis. Therefore, for the first parabola, its directrix is the line y = -p, and the equation of the first parabola is derived from the distance property of a parabola.     2. **First Parabola Equation**:    The parabola's equation is given by the equality of distances between any point on the parabola to the focus and to the directrix:        [    x^2 + y^2 = (y + p)^2    ]    Expanding and simplifying, we get:        [    x^2 + y^2 = y^2 + 2yp + p^2    ]        [    x^2 = 2py + p^2    ]        Solving for y, we obtain:        [    y = frac{x^2 - p^2}{2p}    ] 3. **Tangent to the First Parabola**:    For a point (x_0, y) on the first parabola, the slope of the tangent line is obtained by differentiating y with respect to x:        [    text{slope} = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{x^2 - p^2}{2p}right) = frac{x_0}{p}    ]    The equation of the tangent line at (x_0, y_0), using point-slope form, gives:        [    y - frac{x_0^2 - p^2}{2p} = frac{x_0}{p}(x - x_0)    ]        Simplifying this, we rearrange to get:        [    x_0 x - p y - frac{x_0^2 + p^2}{2} = 0    ] 4. **Second Parabola Equation**:    Since the second parabola has its axis along the x-axis and shares the same focus, its equation can be similarly derived:        [    x = frac{y^2 - q^2}{2q}    ] 5. **Tangent to the Second Parabola**:    For a point (x, y_0) on the second parabola, the tangent line equation is, following the same reasoning:        [    -q x + y_0 y - frac{y_0^2 + q^2}{2} = 0    ] 6. **Determine Common Tangent**:    To find a common tangent to both parabolas, we equate the tangents' equations derived from both parabolas and assert that they represent the same line, up to a multiplicative constant lambda:        [    x_0 = -lambda q, quad -p = lambda y_0, quad frac{x_0^2 + p^2}{2} = lambda frac{y_0^2 + q^2}{2}    ]    Substituting the first two equations into the third gives:        [    left(p^2 + q^2 lambda^2right)(lambda - 1) = 0    ]        Solving for lambda, we get:        [    lambda = 1    ]        Thus, x_0 = -q and y_0 = -p, leading to the common tangent line equation:        [    qx + py + frac{p^2 + q^2}{2} = 0    ]    This proves that there is a common tangent to the two parabolas. 7. **Perpendicular Tangents from a Point on the Common Tangent**:    Considering a point M(x_1, y_1) on the common tangent. Tangents to each parabola from this point need to be perpendicular. Using the previously derived tangent lines, the tangents will be perpendicular if:    [    q x_0 + p y_0 = 0    ]        The intersection of these tangents determining their perpendicular nature:        [    M left( frac{x_0 - q}{2}, frac{y_0 - p}{2} right)    ]        lies on the common tangent line. Hence for any M(x_1, y_1) chosen on the common tangent, the constructed tangents from the point to each parabola will be orthogonal. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{We have demonstrated the existence of a common tangent and the perpendicularity of the second tangents from any point on this common tangent.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let (x) and (y) be integers such that (xy  1) is divisible by the prime number 1979.

Let the three points be denoted as left(x_1, y_1right), left(x_2, y_2right), and left(x_3, y_3right). 2. These points satisfy the condition x_i y_i equiv 1 pmod{1979} for i=1,2,3. This can be written as:     [     x_1 y_1 equiv 1 pmod{1979}, quad x_2 y_2 equiv 1 pmod{1979}, quad x_3 y_3 equiv 1 pmod{1979}     ] 3. Assume all three points lie on a straight line described by the equation ax + by = c, where a and b are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1). Without loss of generality, assume that 1979 nmid b. 4. For the points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), the difference between the points must also satisfy the line equation:     [     a(x_2 - x_1) + b(y_2 - y_1) = 0     ] 5. Multiplying this equation by x_1 x_2, we get:     [     a x_1 x_2 (x_2 - x_1) + b x_1 x_2 (y_2 - y_1) = 0     ] 6. Considering the congruence x_i y_i equiv 1 pmod{1979}, we substitute y_i equiv x_i^{-1} pmod{1979}, giving:     [     a x_1 x_2 (x_2 - x_1) + b x_1 (1/x_1 - 1/x_2) equiv 0 pmod{1979}     ] 7.

Factoring:     [     (a x_1 x_2 + b) (x_2 - x_1) equiv 0 pmod{1979}     ]     This gives us two cases: either x_2 - x_1 equiv 0 pmod{1979} or a x_1 x_2 + b equiv 0 pmod{1979}. 9. If x_2 - x_1 equiv 0 pmod{1979}, then x_1 equiv x_2 pmod{1979}. Since 1979 divides their difference, this implies x_1 - x_2 and hence y_1 - y_2 must also be divisible by 1979:     [    y_1 - y_2 equiv 0 pmod{1979}    ] 10. Hence, left(x_1, y_1right) and left(x_2, y_2right) satisfy the required condition. 11. If a x_1 x_2 equiv -b pmod{1979}, we proceed similarly for the other pair (x_1, x_3). If x_1 equiv x_3 pmod{1979}, then x_1 - x_3 equiv 0 pmod{1979}, and:     [     y_1 - y_3 equiv 0 pmod{1979}     ] 12. If still not x_1 equiv x_3 pmod{1979}, we derive similar to step 7:     [     a x_1 x_3 + b (x_3 - x_1)equiv 0 pmod{1979}     ]     Substituting, we get the same results as above:     [     (a x_1 x_3 + b) (x_3 - x_1) equiv 0 pmod{1979}     ]     This factor must satisfy making either  x_3 - x_1 equiv 0 pmod{1979} or similar as previous steps, providing both conditions. Conclusion: From above cases any two points of the three on line (x_1,y_1) and (x_2, y_2) or (x_3, y_3) will have at least one satisfies x_i, y_i divisible by 1979 ensuring mathematical integrity derivation line axioms.

Considering i^2 = -1, we have: = frac {4+2i+2ai+a}{5} = frac {4+a}{5} + left(frac {2+2a}{5}right)i. Now, set the real part to zero to find a: frac {4+a}{5} = 0. Solving for a: 4+a = 0, a = -4. Hence, for the given complex number to be purely imaginary, the value of a must be -4. We also need to make sure that the imaginary part is not zero: frac {2+2a}{5} neq 0, Substitute a = -4: frac {2+2(-4)}{5} = frac {2-8}{5} = frac {-6}{5} neq 0.

Since the tangent line l at (x_0, f(x_0)) is perpendicular to x - 9y + 1=0, the slope of the tangent line must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. The slope of the given line is 1/9, so we have  f'(x_0) = frac{-1}{1/9} = -9.  This leads to the equation  3x_0^2 + 6x_0 - 9 = -9  which simplifies to   3x_0^2 + 6x_0 = 0.  Factoring out 3x_0, we get  3x_0(x_0 + 2) = 0.  The roots of this equation are x_0 = 0 and x_0 = -2. For x_0 = 0, we have f(x_0) = f(0) = -3, and thus the equation of the tangent line is y = -9x - 3.

(II) To find the extreme values of f(x), we must consider the critical points which occur when the derivative f'(x) is zero:  f'(x) = 3(x+3)(x-1) = 0.  This gives us two critical points, x = -3 and x = 1. To determine whether these critical points correspond to local maxima or minima, we must check the sign of f'(x) around these points. - For x > 1, f'(x) > 0 implies that f(x) is increasing; - For x < -3, f'(x) > 0 also implies that f(x) is increasing; - For -3 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0 implies that f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, f(x) has a local maximum at x = -3 and a local minimum at x = 1.

We now consider the reverse scenario where (q) or (b) are the given values, and we need to find (p) or (a):    - If (q = 16):      [      p = pm 2sqrt{16} = pm 2 cdot 4 = pm 8      ]    - If (q = 64):      [      p = pm 2sqrt{64} = pm 2 cdot 8 = pm 16      ]    - If (q = 1024):      [      p = pm 2sqrt{1024} = pm 2 cdot 32 = pm 64      ]    - If (b = 16):      [      a = pm 2sqrt{16} = pm 2 cdot 4 = pm 8      ]    - If (b = 64):      [      a = pm 2sqrt{64} = pm 2 cdot 8 = pm 16      ]    - If (b = 1024):      [      a = pm 2sqrt{1024} = pm 2 cdot 32 = pm 64      ] 8. Based on these calculations, the possible values for the fourth number are (pm 8), (pm 16), (pm 64), and 262144.

First, consider the case when the circles touch each other externally:    - In this configuration, ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) lie on opposite sides of ( T ), and ( O_1M_1 ) and ( O_2M_2 ) are collinear along the line connecting ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ).    - If the line ( e ) is such that one of ( M_1 ) or ( M_2 ) lies on the line connecting ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), point ( P ) does not exist.    - Otherwise, the quadrilateral ( O_1M_1O_2M_2 ) is a trapezoid where ( O_1M_1 ) and ( O_2M_2 ) are parallel, and hence they are not equal due to different radii ( r_1 neq r_2 ). 6.

This is a standard form of a parabola ( y^2 = 4a(x - h) ), where the vertex of the parabola is at ((h, k)). In this case, ( h = 1 ) and ( k = 0 ), hence the vertex of the parabola ( M ) is ((1, 0)). 2. **Determine the Equation of Circle ( C )**:    Given that the circle ( C ) passes through the vertex ( M ) and is tangent to the y-axis, the center of the circle must lie on the x-axis (since it is symmetric around the y-axis).

The radius ( r ) of the circle is the distance from the center ((-1, 0)) to the point of tangency on the y-axis, which is 1.

The midpoint M has equal power with respect to both circumcircles omega_{1} (circumcircle of triangle ABP) and omega_{2} (circumcircle of triangle ACQ). The power of point M with respect to both circles is given by:    [    MB^2 = MC^2    ] 4. Therefore, the radical axis of these two circles, AS, must pass through the midpoint M to maintain equal power from M to both circumcircles. **Conclusion:** AS bisects BC as it passes through the midpoint M. [boxed{}] **Solution 2:** 1. We observe the angles in the quadrilateral BCPQ and note that:    [    measuredangle CBP = measuredangle BCA = measuredangle BAP = measuredangle CQP    ]    This implies that BCPQ is a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning it can be inscribed within a circle. 2. Since BCPQ is cyclic, the lines AS, BP, and CQ concur at a single point A'. This follows from known properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and intersecting chords. 3. From the given problem, A'B parallel AC and A'C parallel AB. This parallelism indicates that quadrilateral ABA'C forms a parallelogram. 4. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, line ASA' bisects BC because AS = AA' and A' lies on BC due to the properties of parallelograms. **Conclusion:** By establishing that A'B parallel AC and A'C parallel AB, we confirm that the diagonals indeed bisect each other leading to AS bisecting BC.

Therefore, the series converges for all ( x neq pi/2 + 2pi k ) where ( k = 0, pm 1, ldots ). 2. **Transformation using substitution:**    Let ( sin x = t ). The series transforms to:        [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{t^n}{n} ]        which is a geometric series with domain of convergence ( |t| < 1 ). 3. **Using the sum formula for convergent geometric series:**    The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:        [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} t^{n-1} = frac{1}{1-t}, quad |t| < 1 ]     4. **Expressing the series in integrable form:**    It is known that:        [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{t^n}{n} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} int_0^t u^{n-1} , du, quad t in (-1, 1) ]     5. **Integration term-by-term:**    Since a power series can be integrated term-by-term on any interval ([0, t]) fully within its interval of convergence, and using the geometric series sum formula:        [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{t^n}{n} = int_0^t sum_{n=1}^{infty} u^{n-1} , du = int_0^t frac{1}{1-u} , du ]        Computing the integral:        [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{t^n}{n} = -ln(1-t), quad |t| < 1 ] 6. **Considering the convergence at boundary ( t = -1 ):**    Since the series is convergent at ( t = -1 ), its value is continuous from the right at this point. Thus, the above formula holds for ( t in [-1, 1) ). 7. **Substituting ( t ) back to (sin x ):**    Therefore, substituting ( t = sin x ), we get:        [ S(x) = -ln(1-sin x), quad x neq pi/2 + 2pi k ] **Conclusion:** The sum of the given series is: [ boxed{S(x) = -ln(1-sin x), quad x neq pi/2 + 2pi k} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a parabola C: y^{2}=2px (p > 0) with its focus F, a line l passing through F with a slope angle of 60^{circ} intersects the parabola C at points A and B in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, and intersects its axis at point P.

Prove that there must be 2 such monochromatic polygons that are congruent.","output":"1. **Define the setup and notation**:    Given a regular n-gon whose vertices are colored with at least 2 colors such that all vertices of the same color form a regular polygon. We need to prove that there must be at least two such monochromatic polygons that are identical. 2. **Expressing the vertices**:    Consider the center of the regular n-gon as the origin of the complex plane. The vertices of the n-gon can be expressed as:    [    M = left{ u omega^t mid t = 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1 right}    ]    where ( omega = cos frac{2pi}{n} + i sin frac{2pi}{n} ), a primitive n-th root of unity, and ( u ) is a non-zero complex number representing one such vertex (with modulus equal to the circumradius of the n-gon). 3. **Contradict the assumption**:    Assume that all monochromatic regular polygons are different, i.e., their number of sides are different. Let these side counts be ( k_1 < k_2 < cdots < k_r ) where ( k_r < n ) and ( r geq 2 ). We can partition the set ( M ) into ( r ) subsets ( M_j ) where:    [    M_j = left{ u_j omega_j^t mid t = 0,1,2, ldots, k_j-1 right}    ]    with ( omega_j = cos frac{2pi}{k_j} + i sin frac{2pi}{k_j} ) and ( u_j ) being a complex number (all with a modulus equal to the circumradius). 4. **Calculate the sums of powers**:    Define the sum ( S = sum_{z in M} z^{k_1} ) and similarly, ( S_j = sum_{z in M_j} z^{k_1} ). Then,    [    S = sum_{j=1}^r S_j    ] 5. **Evaluate each ( S_j ) using roots of unity properties**:    Notice that for a primitive m-th root of unity ( omega ):    [    sum_{t=0}^{m-1} left( cos frac{2pi}{m} + i sin frac{2pi}{m} right)^k =     begin{cases}     0, & text{if } m nmid k     m, & text{if } m mid k     end{cases}    ] 6. **Apply the property to each ( S_j )**:    For ( j = 2, 3, ldots, r ):    Since ( k_1 < k_j ), it implies ( k_j nmid k_1 ). Therefore,    [    S_j = sum_{t=0}^{k_j-1} (u_j omega_j^t)^{k_1} = u_j^{k_1} sum_{t=0}^{k_j-1} (omega_j^{k_1})^t = u_j^{k_1} sum_{t=0}^{k_j-1} (omega_j')^t = 0    ]    where ( omega_j' = (omega_j)^{k_1} ) is not a k_j-th root of unity. 7. **Derive the contradiction**:    Thus, ( S = S_1 + 0 + 0 + cdots + 0 = S_1 ). But we assumed that ( k_1 mid k_1 ), so:    [    S_1 = sum_{t=0}^{k_1-1} (u_1 omega_1^t)^{k_1} = k_1  u_1^{k_1} neq 0    ]    Hence, ( S neq 0 ), contradicting the initial assumption that all other ( S_j = 0 ).

The equation of the line connecting these points is: [ y = -frac{240}{2t}x + 120 - frac{4800}{2t} ] [ y = -frac{120}{t}x + 120 - frac{2400}{t} ] This line is to be tangent to the circle with equation: [ 40^2 = x^2 + y^2 ] Setting the slope of the tangent line equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line between Steve and Laura, we get: [ -frac{x}{y} = -frac{120}{t} ] [ xy = 120t ] Using substitution from the equation of the line and the circle: [ y = frac{120t}{x} ] [ 40^2 = x^2 + left(frac{120t}{x}right)^2 ] [ 1600 = x^2 + frac{14400t^2}{x^2} ] Multiplying through by x^2 to clear the fraction: [ 1600x^2 = x^4 + 14400t^2 ] [ x^4 - 1600x^2 + 14400t^2 = 0 ] This quadratic in x^2 yields an x^2 value into which we substitute back to solve for t. Solving it gives: [ t = frac{180}{4} = 45 ] Conclusion: The value of t calculated indicates that they can see each other again after 45 seconds.

Substituting (0,0) into the inequality yields: -9 < 0 This is true for all values of a, so the inequality holds at the origin. Next, we consider the y-intercept (0, c) of the line, where c is obtained by setting x = 0 and solving for y: c = frac{9}{a^2 - 3a + 2} For the origin to be above the line, the y-intercept c must be negative.

Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. **Identify the Types of Diagonals:**    We are considering only the diagonals of the form (A_iA_{i+3}) for (1 leq i leq 2019). This notation means, for example, that (A_1A_4), (A_2A_5), etc., are considered, treating the indices modulo 2019 (i.e., (A_{2020} = A_1), (A_{2021} = A_2), and (A_{2022} = A_3)). 2. **Count Total Diagonals:**    Since each vertex will have exactly one diagonal of the form (A_iA_{i+3}) for (1 leq i leq 2019), we have:    [    text{Number of diagonals} = 2019    ] 3. **Determine the Number of Intersections:**    Each time we draw a new diagonal, it can potentially intersect with all the previously drawn diagonals. The idea here is to count the number of intersections accurately. Since the diagonals are of the form (A_iA_{i+3}), and they connect nearly adjacent vertices, intersections become simpler to count. 4. **Intersections Count:**    In a convex polygon, the intersection points of diagonals (A_iA_{i+k}) and (A_jA_{j+k}) represent a unique point specific to this configuration. Since no more than three diagonals can pass through one point (as a property of these specific diagonals), intersections can be counted by careful construction. 5. **Count of Regions:**        Using the principle that each new diagonal introduces new regions plus additional regions for intersections, we calculate:        - Starting with 1 region (the whole polygon),    - Add one region per diagonal: (2019) diagonals -> (2019) additional regions,    - Add the total intersections.     6. **Calculate Intersections:**    For these specific diagonals, if we examine the pattern, maximizing the number of triples that intersect at a point minimizes overall intersections. Suppose each set of three consecutive diagonals passes through the same point.    Count such maximum possible intersections:    [    leftlfloor frac{2019}{2} rightrfloor = 1009    ]    Total regions will thus be:    [    1 + 2019 + 2 cdot 2019 - 1009 = 5049    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The calculated minimum number of resulting pieces, considering the optimization and intersections, leads us to the final result:    [    boxed{5049}    ]"},{"instruction":"f the universal set U = {1, 0, 1, 2}, and P = {x in mathbb{Z} | x^2 < 2}, then the complement of set P with respect to the universal set U is (　　) A: {2} B: {0, 2} C: {1, 2} D: {1, 0, 2}","output":"Given that the universal set is U = {-1, 0, 1, 2} and set P is defined as P = {x in mathbb{Z} | x^2 < 2}.

For f(x) to be an odd function, its domain must be symmetric about the origin.  1. If a=0, then the domain of f(x) becomes {xleft|right.xneq 1}, which is not symmetric about the origin. This implies that a cannot be 0 for f(x) to be an odd function. Thus, we conclude that a neq 0. 2. The condition x neq 1 comes from the denominator 1-x to avoid division by zero. Additionally, to avoid the logarithm of zero or a negative number, a+frac{1}{1-x} neq 0. This leads to the restriction that x neq 1+frac{1}{a}. 3. For f(x) to be odd, its domain must include both x and -x for any x in the domain, implying that 1+frac{1}{a} and -1 must be symmetric about the origin. Therefore, we set 1+frac{1}{a} = -1, which simplifies to a = -frac{1}{2}. 4. Substituting a = -frac{1}{2} into f(x), we get fleft(xright)=ln |frac{1+x}{2(1-x)}|+b. The domain of this function excludes x = 1 and x = -1, ensuring the function is defined for x symmetric about the origin. 5. To find b, we use the property that an odd function satisfies f(0) = 0. Substituting x = 0 into f(x), we get ln frac{1}{2} + b = 0. Solving for b, we find b = ln 2. Therefore, the values of a and b that make f(x) an odd function are a = -frac{1}{2} and b = ln 2.

Therefore, there must exist ( N in mathbb{Z}_{>0} ) such that ( {1, 2, dots, t-1} subset {a_0, a_1, a_2, dots, a_N} ). 2. **Define k-good numbers**: A positive integer ( l ) is called *k-good* if:    - ( l equiv 0 pmod{p_1 p_2 dots p_{k-1}} )    - ( l equiv 1 pmod{p_k} )    where ( p_i ) is the ( i )-th prime number. 3. **Observation on k-good numbers**: Note that ( a_n ) cannot be a k-good number for any ( n > N ); otherwise, we would have ( a_{n+1} = t ) (since ( p_k = p(a_n) mid (a_n^t - 1) ) and ( 1, 2, dots, t-1 ) have already appeared), which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, there are finitely many k-good numbers that appear in the sequence. 4. **Lemma on ( p(n) )**: We need to show that ( p(n) < D log n ) for some constant ( D ) and for all ( n ).    - Let ( p_k = p(n) ). By definition, ( p_1 p_2 dots p_{k-1} mid n ), so ( k! < p_1 p_2 dots p_{k-1} le n ).    - Using the Prime Number Theorem and Stirling's approximation, we know that ( k > C_1 frac{p_k}{log p_k} ) and ( k! > C_2 left(frac{k}{e}right)^k ) for some constants ( C_1, C_2 ).    - Therefore, ( p(n) < D log n ) for some constant ( D ). 5. **Choose large constants**: Take sufficiently large constants ( P, Q ).

Note that since ( q-1 mid c ), we must have ( q mid a_n^c - 1 ), and so ( a_{n+1} le c le a_n ), which contradicts the choice of ( n ). 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that ( t ) does not appear in the sequence is false.

Step-by-step analysis: 1. **Number of digits function ( d(n) )**:     - The number of digits ( d(n) ) of ( n ) in base ( b ) is given by ( d(n) = lfloor log_b n rfloor + 1 ). 2. **Behavior of ( f(n) )**:     - Observe that for a number ( n ) with ( d(n) = d ), ( n ) satisfies ( b^{d-1} leq n < b^d ).     - Hence, ( f(n) ) involves the product of ( n ) and ( f(d(n)) ). 3. **Key insight**:     - We need to understand the behavior of the sum involving ( f(n) ) to determine the convergence of ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{f(n)} ). 4. **Analyzing ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{f(n)} )**:     - Consider the sum of reciprocals ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{f(n)} ).     - For numbers ( n ) with a fixed number of digits ( d ) in base ( b ), we note that there are approximately ( b cdot b^{d-1} = b^d ) such numbers. 5. **Integral approximation**:     - We approximate the sum by comparing it with an integral:      [     sum_{n=b^{d-1}}^{b^d - 1} frac{1}{n} > int_{b^{d-1}}^{b^d} frac{1}{x} , dx = ln b.     ] 6. **Summing over all digit lengths**:     - Therefore,     [     sum_{d=1}^{infty} sum_{n= b^{d-1}}^{b^d - 1} frac{1}{f(n)} > sum_{d=1}^{infty} frac{ln b}{f(d)}.     ]     - If ( b geq 3 ), then ( ln b > 1 ). 7. **Contradiction for ( b geq 3 )**:     - If ( b geq 3 ), the above implies that if ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{f(n)} ) converges to some value ( k ), then:     [     k > k,     ]     - which is a contradiction.

Formally, d mod n = r, where r neq 0 otherwise Petya can take all stones at once if r = 0.     2. **Petya's First Move**:    Petya can opt to take a number of stones that leaves the remaining count of stones in the form a_k = r + nk, where 0 leq k leq n - 1. This is because Petya can take a multiple of n stones, leaving the count as r + nk. Since d > n^2, there are more than enough stones to satisfy this for various k.     3. **Vasya's Response**:    Let c_k be the number of stones Vasya takes in his strategy when there are a_k stones. Note that c_k cannot be a multiple of n, otherwise after his move, the remainder will still be form r + nk' for integer k', enabling Petya to win by following Vasya's strategy.        Therefore, all c_k's must be less than n and since there are n such scenarios (a_k = r + nk for 0 leq k leq n - 1), there are repetitions by the Pigeonhole Principle, that is, for some 0 leq k < l leq n-1, we have c_k = c_l. 4. **Petya's Strategy to Counter Vasya**:    Now suppose Petya's first move leaves a_l stones, and Vasya then takes c_l stones, resulting in a_l - c_l stones. Petya can then take an additional n cdot (l - k) stones, leaving a_k - c_k stones. 5. **Reapplication of Vasya’s Strategy**:    The resultant a_k - c_k still falls within the form discussed earlier, meaning Petya can continue to follow the response pattern of Vasya’s own strategy. This ensures Petya can always counter Vasya until the last stone is taken by Petya. # Conclusion: We observe that Petya can always adjust his moves to match any of Vasya's attempts, ensuring he takes the last stone.

Because (AD) is parallel to (BC) (a defining property of parallelograms), we have:    [    angle ABC = 180^circ - angle BAD = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ    ]    This follows by the fact that (angle ABC) and (angle BAD) are co-interior angles (also known as consecutive or allied interior angles) on parallel lines cut by the transversal (AB). 3.

In the triangle (ABE), we now have angles at vertices (A) and (B) both equal to (60^circ). Therefore, the remaining angle at vertex (E) must also be (60^circ):    [    angle AEB = 60^circ    ]    Therefore, (bigtriangleup ABE) is an equilateral triangle because all its angles are (60^circ). 5.

Therefore, the length of (BF) in (bigtriangleup BCF) is equal to its other sides:    [    BF = BC = 88    ]     8.

A few remaining cases will then be easier to analyze directly. We will utilize the inequality: [ left(1 + frac{d}{n}right)^n < e^d, ] where (e) is the base of the natural logarithm, and we know that (e < 2.8). Clearly, there are no solutions where (x = y) because: [ x^y - y^x = x^x - x^x = 0 neq 1. ] Thus, we consider the two primary cases: (x > y) and (x < y).  Case 1: (x > y) Let (x = y + d) where (d geq 1). Assume (y geq 3). We can then estimate: [ y^d geq 3^d > e^d > left(1 + frac{d}{y}right)^y ] It follows that: [ x^y - y^x = (y + d)^y - y^{y + d} = y^y left( left(1 + frac{d}{y}right)^y - y^d right) < y^y (e^d - y^d) ] Since (y geq 3), we have: [ e^d - 3^d < 0. ] Thus: [ x^y - y^x < y^y (e^d - 3^d) < 0, ] which contradicts (x^y - y^x = 1). Therefore, the only possible solutions for (x > y) must have (y = 1) or (y = 2). 1. If (y = 1), then we need (x^1 - 1^x = 1 Rightarrow x - 1 = 1 Rightarrow x = 2). This solves the equation and is thus a valid pair. 2. If (y = 2), then: [ x^2 - 2^x = 1. ] Given (x > y), the first possible value is (x = 3), and indeed: [ 3^2 - 2^3 = 9 - 8 = 1. ] Thus, ((x = 3, y = 2)) is a solution. Verify if (x geq 4) could be a solution by checking if: [ x^2 - 2^x = 1 Rightarrow 2^x - x^2 > 2. ] This is certainly not true as (2^x) grows much faster than (x^2), especially for (x geq 5). By mathematical induction, assume it is true for (x > 4). Then: [ 2^{x+1} - (x+1)^2 = 2 cdot 2^x - (x^2 + 2x + 1). ] Given: [ 2 cdot 2^x > 2x^2 + 4x + 2 > 0 quad text{(true for all (x geq 5))}. ] Thus no solutions exist for (x geq 5) in this scenario.  Case 2: (x < y) Let (y = x + d) where (d geq 1). Assume (x geq 3). We then estimate: [ x^{x+d} - (x+d)^x = x^x left( x^d - left(1 + frac{d}{x}right)^x right) > x^x (x^d - e^d). ] Using (x geq 3), [ 3^3 (3^d - e^d) geq 27 (3 - 2.8) > 1. ] Thus, the only possible solutions where (x = 1) or (2). 1. If (x = 1), then the equation becomes (1^y - y^1 = 1 Rightarrow 1 - y = 1). Hence, this is not a valid combination. 2. If (x = 2), then the equation is: [ 2^y - y^2 = 1. ] Since we showed this expression is greater than 2 for (y geq 5), try (y = 3) and (y = 4).

Consider the neighbors A and B of a convex n-gon. 2. Analyze the triangulation by diagonals originating from vertex A and those originating from vertex B. 3. Note that there are no common diagonals between these two triangulations. 4. Each transformation only alters one diagonal.

Part (b): P(n) leq 2n-7 1. We use induction on n.    - Base case: For n = 4, it is straightforward as there are no internal diagonals.     2. Assume the statement is true for smaller polygons. For an n-gon:    - Choose any vertex ( A ).    - Any triangulation can be converted to one where all diagonals emanate from ( A ) in at most n-3 transformations.    - Similarly, for converting another triangulation such that all diagonals emanate from ( A ), we also require at most n-3 transformations.    - However, we've essentially converted both triangulations into the one where all diagonals emanate from vertex ( A ), achieving the desired triangulations in 2(n-3) transformations.     3. We can actually save one transformation by ensuring one chosen vertex is common:    2(n-3) - 1 = 2n-7 transformations will suffice.     Conclusion: P(n) leq 2n - 7.  Part (c): P(n) leq 2n - 10 for n ge 13 1. Total diagonals in two triangulations are 2(n-3):    - Considering diagonals, each vertex averages dfrac{4(n-3)}{n} diagonals.     2. For n geq 13:    - Since dfrac{4(n-3)}{n} > 3, there must exist one vertex with at least 4 diagonals.    - Choosing such a vertex ensures we save more transformations as more diagonals can be aligned faster.     3. Therefore, from induction in part (b) and selecting vertices with more diagonals:    - We attain fewer necessary transformations, verifying our desired result.

Let the vertex of the parabola be at the point ((a, a^2)), where ( a ) is some real number.  3. Recall that in the standard form ( y = -x^2 + px + q ), the vertex ((a, a^2)) can also be represented as:    [    y = -left(x - frac{p}{2}right)^2 + frac{p^2}{4} + q    ] 4. By comparing the vertex form of the parabola with the given condition ((a, a^2)), we get:    [    a = frac{p}{2}    ] 5. Substituting ( p = 2a ) into the equation of the parabola, we have:    [    y = -x^2 + (2a)x + q    ] 6. Since ((a, a^2)) lies on this parabola, substitute ( x = a ) and ( y = a^2 ) into the parabola's equation:    [    a^2 = -a^2 + 2a cdot a + q    ] 7. Simplify the equation to find ( q ):    [    a^2 = -a^2 + 2a^2 + q     a^2 = a^2 + q    ] 8. Therefore:    [    q = 0    ] 9. Now, we substitute ( q = 0 ) back into the equation of the parabola to get:    [    y = -x^2 + 2ax    ] 10.

This function is monotonically decreasing within this interval, meaning that as x increases, cos x decreases. By this property: [ cos A < cos (90^circ - B) = sin B ] which shows that: [ cos A < sin B quad Longrightarrow quad sin B - cos A > 0 ] Similarly, since angle B is also acute, we have B > 90^circ - A, and thus: [ cos B < cos (90^circ - A) = sin A ] resulting in: [ cos B - sin A < 0 ] Now let's examine the coordinates of point P(cos B - sin A, sin B - cos A): - The x-coordinate, cos B - sin A, is less than 0. - The y-coordinate, sin B - cos A, is greater than 0. Considering the signs of x and y coordinates for the point P, it lies in the second quadrant because in the Cartesian coordinate system, the second quadrant is where x is negative and y is positive. Therefore, the answer is: [ boxed{text{Quadrant II}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the curve y=x^{3}, find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line at the point (1,1), the xaxis, and the line x=2.","output":"First, we find the derivative of the curve y=x^{3}. This gives us y'=3x^{2}. Next, we find the slope of the tangent line at the point (1,1) by plugging x=1 into the derivative. This gives us y'=3. So, the slope of the tangent line is 3 (i.e., k=3). The equation of the tangent line at the point (1,1) is therefore: y-1=3(x-1) Simplifying this equation gives us: 3x-y-2=0 To find where the tangent line intersects the x-axis, we set y=0 and solve for x. This gives us x=frac{2}{3}. The area of the triangle formed by the tangent line, the x-axis, and the line x=2 is given by: S=frac{1}{2}times(2-frac{2}{3})times4=frac{8}{3} Therefore, the area of the triangle is boxed{frac{8}{3}}. To solve this problem, we first needed to find the equation of the tangent line at the point (1,1). To do this, we found the slope of the tangent line using the derivative of the curve. We then used this slope to find the equation of the tangent line. Finally, we used this equation to find where the tangent line intersects the x-axis and calculated the area of the resulting triangle. This problem primarily tests understanding of the slope of a line, the geometric meaning of a derivative, and the use of derivatives to find the equation of a tangent line.

This suggests that the function g(x) = xf(x) = e^{x} - ax^{3} is monotonically increasing for x in (0, +infty). 2. **Differentiating g(x)**: To confirm the monotonic behavior of g(x), we differentiate it with respect to x to get g'(x) = e^{x} - 3ax^{2}. For g(x) to be monotonically increasing, g'(x) geqslant 0 must hold true for all x in (0, +infty). 3. **Finding the Condition for a**: The condition g'(x) geqslant 0 simplifies to 3a leqslant frac{{e}^{x}}{{x}^{2}}. To find the range of a, we analyze the function h(x) = frac{{e}^{x}}{{x}^{2}}. 4. **Analyzing h(x)**: The derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = frac{{e}^{x}(x-2)}{{x}^{3}}. This shows that h(x) is monotonically decreasing for 0 < x < 2 and monotonically increasing for x > 2. Therefore, h(x) achieves its minimum value at x = 2. 5. **Minimum Value of h(x)**: Evaluating h(x) at x = 2 gives h(2) = frac{{e}^{2}}{4}. Since 3a leqslant frac{{e}^{x}}{{x}^{2}} for all x in (0, +infty), and the minimum value of the right-hand side is frac{{e}^{2}}{4} at x = 2, we have 3a leqslant frac{{e}^{2}}{4}. 6. **Determining the Range of a**: Solving 3a leqslant frac{{e}^{2}}{4} for a gives a leqslant frac{{e}^{2}}{12}. Therefore, the range of real number a is (-infty, frac{{e}^{2}}{12}].

From the given information, we get c = 2. Since overrightarrow{PF} = overrightarrow{FQ}, points P, F, and Q are collinear. Let P be (2, n). Substituting this in the equation of the parabola, we get n = pm 4. Substitute P(2, pm 4) into the hyperbola's equation: frac{4}{a^{2}} - frac{16}{b^{2}} = 1 and since F is the right focus of the hyperbola, we have a^2 + b^2 = 4.

To find the focus of the parabola and its directrix equation, we determine c = 2. By setting up the coordinates of P, using the definition of a parabola, we can obtain the coordinates of P.

Let their intersection be (E). Show that if [ CE:AB = AD:BC, ] then (DE) is parallel to (AC), and (BE) is parallel to (CD).","output":"1. We begin by employing the auxiliary theorem. By drawing the diagonals of a trapezoid, the four triangles formed include two similar triangles that contain the bases of the trapezoid. These triangles are similar because their angles are pairwise equal. The corresponding pairs of sides are a base of the trapezoid and two segments from any diagonal. Therefore, the diagonals of the trapezoid bisect each other such that each segment's ratio is equal to the ratio of the bases that share endpoints with those segments. 2. We apply this theorem to the trapezoid (ABCD) and the trapezoid (ABCE) on the diagonals starting from (B). Let the points where these diagonals intersect be (E_1) and (D_1), respectively. Thus, we have the following relations: [ frac{DE_1}{E_1B} = frac{AD}{BC}, quad text{and} quad frac{ED_1}{D_1B} = frac{CE}{AB} ] 3. Since, by the problem condition: [ frac{CE}{AB} = frac{AD}{BC} ] it follows that the ratios on both sides of the equations are equal: [ frac{DE_1}{E_1B} = frac{ED_1}{D_1B} ] 4. Adding 1 to both sides: [ frac{DB}{E_1B} = frac{EB}{D_1B} ] From this, the triangles (BED) and (BD_1E_1) are similarly oriented, meaning (DE) is parallel to (D_1E_1), i.e., parallel to (AC). This confirms the first assertion of the task. 5. Now, applying the auxiliary theorem to the diagonal (AC) shared by both trapezoids: [ frac{CD_1}{D_1A} = frac{CE}{AB} = frac{AD}{BC} = frac{AE_1}{E_1C}, quad frac{CA}{D_1A} = frac{AC}{E_1C} ] 6. Hence, (D_1A = E_1C). Therefore, the segments (D_1C) and (E_1A) are equal, making the quadrilateral (AED_1E_1) a parallelogram. Therefore, (E_1A = DE). Hence, (D_1C = DE). This means that (D_1C) and (DE) are parallel and equal segments, indicating that (CD) is parallel to (D_1E), i.e., (DE) is parallel to (AC) and (CD) is parallel to (BE). By the auxiliary theorem used in the same way, this proves the second assertion.

Notice that:    [    1991 = 3n + 2    ]    This equation will help in applying mathematical induction. 4. **Base Case (Induction Start)**:    When ( n = 0 ), the premise reduces to having 2 points ( (3 cdot 0 + 2 = 2) ) with no -1 points at all. Clearly, any point will be a good point in this trivial case since all points are +1.

The remaining number of points is:    [    (3k + 5) - 3 = 3k + 2    ]    In this configuration, there are at most ( k ) points labeled -1 among the ( 3k + 2 ) points. 8. **Use Induction Hypothesis**:    By the induction hypothesis, there exists at least one good point ( P ) among these remaining ( 3k + 2 ) points where the number of -1 points does not exceed ( k ). 9. **Restoring Removed Points**:    Place the three removed points back in their original positions. The point ( P ) remains a good point because:    - Moving from ( P ) in any direction will encounter at least one +1 point before encountering any -1 point.    - Thus, the sum of numbers encountered from ( P ) will initially remain positive due to encountering +1s before any remaining -1s. 10. **Conclusion of Induction**:    Therefore, the hypothesis is true for ( n = k + 1 ). 11. **Final Conclusion**:    By induction, the statement holds for every non-negative integer ( n ).

(I) Express the profit y (in ten thousand yuan) as a function of the promotional expenses x (in ten thousand yuan);  (II) How much should be invested in promotional expenses to maximize the manufacturer's profit?","output":"Solution: - (I) According to the problem, we have y=(4+ frac{20}{P})P-x-(10+2P), which earns 3 points.   Substituting P=3- frac{2}{x+1} into the equation and simplifying, we get: y=16- frac{4}{x+1}-x (where 0 leq x leq a), which earns 6 points.   - (II) The derivative of y with respect to x is y'=-1- frac{-4}{(x+1)^2}= frac{-(x+1)^2+4}{(x+1)^2}=- frac{x^2+2x-3}{(x+1)^2}=- frac{(x+3)(x-1)}{(x+1)^2}.   When a geq 1, for x in (0, 1), y' > 0, so the function y=16-x- frac{4}{x+1} is increasing on the interval (0, 1). For x in (1, a), y' < 0, so the function y=16-x- frac{4}{x+1} is decreasing on the interval (1, a).   When the promotional expenses are 1 ten thousand yuan, the manufacturer's profit is maximized, which earns 9 points.   When a < 1, since the function y=16-x- frac{4}{x+1} is increasing on the interval (0, 1), y=16-x- frac{4}{x+1} is increasing on the interval [0, a],   thus, at x=a, the function reaches its maximum value. That is, when the promotional expenses are a ten thousand yuan, the manufacturer's profit is maximized.   In summary, when a geq 1, the promotional expenses should be boxed{1} ten thousand yuan to maximize the manufacturer's profit;   when a < 1, the promotional expenses should be boxed{a} ten thousand yuan to maximize the manufacturer's profit, which earns 12 points.

Given that there must be both at least one knight and one liar, all 10 cannot be knights.

This is a direct consequence of a result often cited in topology or real analysis, known as **Heine-Borel Theorem** which states that a continuous function on a compact set is bounded. 2. **Step 2: Supremum exists**    Establish that the supremum ( M ) (least upper bound) of the function values on ([a, b]) exists. This follows from the completeness property of the real numbers. Specifically:    [    M = sup {f(x) mid x in [a, b] }.    ] 3. **Step 3: Construct a sequence approaching the supremum**    Given the definition of the supremum, we can construct a sequence ( {x_n} ) in ([a, b]) such that:    [    lim_{n to infty} f(x_n) = M.    ]    More formally,    [    M - frac{1}{n} leq f(x_n) leq M quad text{for all } n.    ] 4. **Step 4: Extract a convergent subsequence**    Since ([a, b]) is a closed and bounded interval, it is compact.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:    [    mathrm{P}(B mid A) = frac{mathrm{P}(A mid B) cdot mathrm{P}(B)}{mathrm{P}(A)}    ] 3. First, calculate the individual probabilities:    - mathrm{P}(B) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{5} since the teacher checks homework with probability frac{1}{2}, and if they do, each day (Monday to Friday) has an equal frac{1}{5} probability. So,      [      mathrm{P}(B) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{5} = frac{1}{10}      ]        - mathrm{P}(S) = frac{1}{2} since the teacher does not check homework with probability frac{1}{2}. 4. Event A happens if:    - The homework is not checked at all (S), or    - The homework is only checked on Friday (B).    Thus, the probability of event A can be computed as:    [    mathrm{P}(A) = mathrm{P}(S) + mathrm{P}(B) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{10}    ]    Simplify the expression:    [    mathrm{P}(A) = frac{5}{10} + frac{1}{10} = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5}    ] 5. Now, using Bayes' theorem:    [    mathrm{P}(B mid A) = frac{mathrm{P}(A mid B) cdot mathrm{P}(B)}{mathrm{P}(A)}    ]    Here, mathrm{P}(A mid B) is the probability of A given that B has happened. If B has happened, A must be true because checking happens on Friday, ensuring no check before Friday:    [    mathrm{P}(A mid B) = 1    ]    Therefore:    [    mathrm{P}(B mid A) = frac{1 cdot frac{1}{10}}{frac{3}{5}} = frac{frac{1}{10}}{frac{3}{5}} = frac{1}{10} cdot frac{5}{3} = frac{1}{6}    ] 6.

C's share is Rs. 32. The sum of money is Rs. 164. How many paisa does C have for each Rs. A has?","output":"Let's denote the amount of money A has as A, B has as B, and C has as C. We know that C's share is Rs. 32, so C = 32. We also know that the total sum of money is Rs. 164, so A + B + C = 164. For each rupee A has, B has 65 paisa. Since 1 rupee is equal to 100 paisa, we can say that for each Rs. 1 A has, B has Rs. 0.65. So, B = 0.65A. Now we can substitute B and C into the total sum equation: A + 0.65A + 32 = 164 Combining A and 0.65A, we get: 1.65A + 32 = 164 Now, let's solve for A: 1.65A = 164 - 32 1.65A = 132 A = 132 / 1.65 A = 80 Now that we have A's share, we can find out how many paisa C has for each Rs. A has. Since C's share is Rs. 32 and A's share is Rs. 80, we can set up the following ratio: C's paisa per A's rupee = (C's share in paisa) / (A's share in rupees) C's share in paisa = 32 * 100 (since 1 rupee = 100 paisa) C's share in paisa = 3200 paisa Now, we can find the ratio: C's paisa per A's rupee = 3200 paisa / 80 rupees C's paisa per A's rupee = 40 paisa Therefore, C has boxed{40}  paisa for each Rs.

According to the problem, the total amount she put into savings is 90.00, which includes the initial savings S and the half of her earnings from the second bet. So we have: S + (1/2) * 1.60 * B = 90.00 We already know that S + B = 100.00, so we can substitute S from the first equation into the second equation: 100.00 - B + 0.80 * B = 90.00 100.00 - 0.20 * B = 90.00 Now, we solve for B: 0.20 * B = 100.00 - 90.00 0.20 * B = 10.00 B = 10.00 / 0.20 B = 50.00 Now that we know B is 50.00, we can find S by substituting B back into the first equation: S + 50.00 = 100.00 S = 100.00 - 50.00 S = 50.00 So, Opal put 50.00 into savings after the first win and bet 50.00 after the first win.

Since the set is already ordered from least to greatest, the median will be the middle number when the integers are listed in order. With five numbers, the median will be the third number, which is ( x + 4 ). Now, let's find the mean of the set. The mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers. The sum of the integers is: ( x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 7) + (x + 27) ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 5x + 40 ) Since there are 5 numbers, the mean will be: ( frac{5x + 40}{5} = x + 8 ) According to the problem, the mean is 4 greater than the median. We know the median is ( x + 4 ), so the mean must be ( x + 4 + 4 ), which simplifies to ( x + 8 ). This is consistent with the mean we calculated above.

The function h(x) is increasing on the interval (1, +infty) because the derivative h'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} is positive for x > 1. Since h(3) = 1 - ln 3 < 0 and h(4) = 2 - ln 4 > 0, there exists x_0 in (3,4) such that h(x_0) = 0. Thus, for x in (1, x_0), we have h(x) < 0 and for x in (x_0, +infty), h(x) > 0. It follows that g'(x) < 0 for x in (1, x_0) and g'(x) > 0 for x in (x_0, +infty). Knowing this, we see that g(x) is decreasing on the interval (1, x_0) and increasing on (x_0, +infty). Moreover, the minimum value of g(x) occurs at x_0. Because g(3) = frac{3ln 3 + 9 - 2}{3 - 1} = frac{3ln 3 + 7}{2} and g(4) = frac{4ln 4 + 12 - 2}{4 - 1} = frac{2ln 4 + 10}{2} = 4 + 2ln 4, we have g(3) < g(4). Thus, we need to find the largest integer k less than g(3). Since frac{3ln 3 + 7}{2} < 5 < 4 + 2ln 4, we get that the maximum integer value for k is 5. Therefore, the maximum value of k that satisfies the condition is boxed{5}, so the correct answer is B."},{"instruction":"A travel agency offers a group travel package during the summer holidays with the following conditions: for a group of 100 people, the charge is 1000 yuan per person.

Determine the conditions in which sequence B must be such that any segment of length n of sequence B is contained within sequence A. Sequence A is periodic with period 1995, while sequence B must not have a periodicity of 1995 or be non-periodic. 2. To solve this problem, we make use of the assumption that the periodic sequence A should cover all possible segments of length n that could appear in any sequence B. Since sequence A has a period of 1995, this means that any sequence B segment of length n must be entirely within a period (or a segment which repeats every 1995) of sequence A.   3. Next, understand that the largest possible n  that fits into the periodic constraints of A is crucial. It essentially hinges on the construction of a sequence that exactly fits or covers every possible scenario without repetition or limitation from periodicity smaller than 1995. 4. Observe that any segment of sequence B longer than the period of sequence A will eventually repeat if it was periodic. Therefore, to achieve a scenario so that B cannot have a period exactly matching that of A or be an irregularly repeating sequence shorter than the period of A, we require n to maximize within this constraint. 5.

Therefore, the speed of the train (Speed = Distance / Time) is: Speed = 800 meters / 48 seconds Speed = 16.67 meters per second (rounded to two decimal places) Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to cross the signal pole, we only need to consider the length of the train, as the signal pole can be assumed to have negligible width compared to the length of the train. Since the speed of the train is constant, we can use the same speed to calculate the time it takes to cross the signal pole: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Length of train / Speed Time = 300 meters / 16.67 meters per second Time ≈ 17.99 seconds So it takes approximately boxed{18}  seconds for the train to cross the signal pole."},{"instruction":"Quadrilateral ABCD is a square, and segment AE is perpendicular to segment ED.

This property means the graph is a **tree**, a connected acyclic graph. 2. **Base Case Consideration:**    Let's first consider the base case where (n = 1). If there is just one point, then there are no edges. 3. **Hypothesis for Induction:**    Assume that for a graph with (k) points that satisfy the problem's conditions, there are exactly (k - 1) edges. We will then proceed to prove this for (k + 1) points. 4. **Existence of a Vertex with One Edge:**    Each point in the graph must have at least one edge. We show that there is at least one point with just one edge. Assume the contrary, that is, every point has at least two edges:    - Construct a path where each edge and point appear exactly once. Starting from any point, say (A), move along an edge to (B).    - Continue moving to a new point (C) via an edge, ensuring that (C) is not on the path. Continue this process.    - If at a point (X), there are still unused edges (and if unvisited), proceed to (Y).

Prove that one of them can be moved to an adjacent square so that, once again, no two pieces are on adjacent squares.","output":"1. Assume the contrary. This means that no chip can be moved to an adjacent cell without violating the condition that no two chips are on neighboring sides. 2. Clearly, there must be empty columns on the board, as n - 1 chips cannot fill all n columns. 3. Consider the placement of the chips on the board when at least one column is empty. A critical observation here is that an empty column cannot be at the edges.     - Suppose an empty column, say the rightmost column (i.e., n-th column), is empty. In such a scenario, a chip from the column immediately to the left (i.e., the (n-1)-th column) can be moved rightward into the empty column without placing two chips on neighboring cells. This contradicts the assumption that no chip can be moved without violating the condition. 4. Similarly, it can be shown that there can be no two consecutive empty columns. If there were two adjacent empty columns, you could move a chip from the non-empty column next to these two columns into one of the empty columns while maintaining the non-neighboring condition among chips. 5. Therefore, to each empty column, there must be a corresponding \\"left\\" chip in the non-empty columns (i.e., a chip that could be moved rightward but is prevented by the assumption). Such \\"left\\" chips cannot be in the same column since each empty column effectively needs to be \\"guarded\\" by such a chip. This shows that each empty column keeps a signal chip to its immediate left. 6. Let k be the number of empty columns. Then at least k chips must be the \\"left\\" chips associated with them. 7. Consequently, the chips occupy no more than n - 1 - k columns, implying that there are at least k + 1 empty rows (note that the board has n rows and n - 1 chips total). This creates a contradiction as it indicates more empty rows than empty columns and vice versa. 8. Given this contradiction, the assumption that no chip can be moved must be false. Therefore, at least one chip can be moved to an adjacent cell while maintaining the condition. Hence, one of the chips can be moved to an adjacent cell such that no two chips are on neighboring sides.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Evaluate the definite integral int_{0}^{4}{sqrt{16{x}^{2}}}dx= _________","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the geometric meaning of the definite integral, which is a basic problem. **Solution** Let y= sqrt{16-{x}^{2}}, then x^{2}+y^{2}=16(ygeqslant 0), The trajectory of the point (x,y) represents the upper half of the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=16, int_{0}^{4} sqrt{16-{x}^{2}}dx represents frac{1}{4} of the area of a circle with the origin as its center and 4 as its radius, Therefore, int_{0}^{4} sqrt{16-{x}^{2}}dx = frac{1}{4} timespitimes4^{2}=4pi, Hence, the answer is boxed{4pi}."},{"instruction":"f ( g(x) = dfrac{x2}{x5} ), then for what value of ( x ) is ( g^{1}(x) ) undefined?","output":"We start by finding the inverse function of ( g ).

Show that triangles ( A_{1}B_{1}C_{1} ) and ( A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} ) are congruent.","output":"1. First, let's define the points and projections in the triangle (ABC). We need to find point (A_1) on side (BC) such that the projection of (A_1) onto (CA) is (B_1), the projection of (B_1) onto (AB) is (C_1), and the projection of (C_1) onto (BC) lands back at (A_1). Similarly, we need to define points (A_2, B_2,) and (C_2) on sides (BC, CA,) and (AB) respectively, such that (A_2C_2 perp BA, C_2B_2 perp AC,) and (B_2A_2 perp CB). 2. Construct point (A_1) on side (BC). Let (B^*) be an arbitrary point on line (AC) (distinct from (A)), and let (C^*) be the perpendicular projection of (B^*) onto line (AB). Define the intersection of the perpendiculars from (B^*) to (AC) and from (C^*) to (BC) as point (A^*). Then point (A_1) is the intersection of line (AA^*) with side (BC). 3. Denote the projection of (A_1) onto (CA) as (B_1) and the projection of (B_1) onto (AB) as (C_1). This ensures that (A_1B_1 parallel A^*B^*) and (B_1C_1 parallel B^*C^*). Consequently, the triangles (AA_1B_1) and (AA^*B^*) as well as (AB_1C_1) and (AB^*C^*) are similar. Thus,     [     frac{AA_1}{AA^*} = frac{AB_1}{AB^*} quad text{and} quad frac{AB_1}{AB^*} = frac{AC_1}{AC^*}     ]     Therefore,      [     frac{AA_1}{AA^*} = frac{AC_1}{AC^*}     ] 4. From this similarity, it follows that triangles (AA_1C_1) and (AA^*C^*) have one common angle and the sides around this angle are in the same proportion. Hence, (A_1C_1 parallel A^*C^*), which implies that (A_1C_1 perp BC). 5. This construction of (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) clearly defines a unique triangle (A_1B_1C_1). 6. Now, construct triangle (A_2B_2C_2) using a similar method starting from point (B). Follow the same steps by swapping the roles of (A) and (B). 7. Reflect triangle (A_1B_1C_1) about the circumcenter (O_1) (center of the circle (k_1) circumscribing (A_1B_1C_1)). Let the image of the vertices be (A_1', B_1', C_1'). Show that these transformed points coincide with (B_2, C_2,) and (A_2) respectively by noting the right angles and perpendicular relationships:     [     C_1'B_1' parallel C_1B_1 perp BA, quad B_1'A_1' parallel B_1A_1 perp AC,  quad A_1'C_1' parallel A_1C_1 perp BC     ] 8. Each of these reflected triangles exhibits the same perpendicular relationships with the original triangle (ABC). Given the uniqueness shown previously (from the first solution), the transformed triangle must match (A_2B_2C_2). 9. To confirm congruence, we can use the relationships derived through triangle similarity and side-length calculations. For example, the ratios:     [     frac{AA_1}{AA^*} = frac{BA_2}{BA^*}     ]     This establishes that triangle (A_1B_1C_1) is congruent to triangle (A_2B_2C_2). 10.

Otherwise, he immediately moves on to the next crosswalk. If he arrives at the last crosswalk and has not crossed yet, then he crosses regardless of the wait time.

At each crosswalk, if the wait time ( t ) is uniformly distributed from ( [0, 60] ), the probability that ( t ) is more than ( k ) seconds is ( frac{60 - k}{60} = 1 - frac{k}{60} ). 3. Thus, the probability that Dan does not cross at any of the first 9 crosswalks is:    [    left(1 - frac{k}{60}right)^9    ] 4. If Dan reaches the last (10th) crosswalk without crossing at any of the previous 9, he will cross regardless of the wait time. The expected value of the wait time ( t ) at the last crosswalk is the midpoint of the interval ( [0, 60] ), which is ( 30 ) seconds. 5. On the other hand, the probability that Dan crosses at one of the first 9 crosswalks is:    [    1 - left(1 - frac{k}{60}right)^9    ]    If he crosses at one of these crosswalks, the expected wait time is the average wait time ( frac{k}{2} ). 6.

We know that each monthly payment is triple the amount of the previous month's payment, and her first payment is 100. Let's denote the first payment as P1, the second payment as P2, and so on. We can then express the payments as follows: - P1 = 100 - P2 = 3 * P1 = 3 * 100 = 300 - P3 = 3 * P2 = 3 * 300 = 900 - ... This sequence of payments forms a geometric series where the first term (a) is 100 and the common ratio (r) is 3. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. We are given that the total amount Joan must pay back is 12,100, so we set S_n equal to 12,100 and solve for n: 12,100 = 100 * (1 - 3^n) / (1 - 3) Since 1 - 3 is -2, we can simplify the equation: 12,100 = 100 * (1 - 3^n) / (-2) Multiplying both sides by -2 to get rid of the denominator: -2 * 12,100 = 100 * (1 - 3^n) - 24,200 = 100 - 100 * 3^n Now, we add 100 * 3^n to both sides and subtract 24,200 from both sides: 100 * 3^n = 24,300 Now, we divide both sides by 100 to isolate 3^n: 3^n = 24,300 / 100 3^n = 243 Now, we need to find the value of n for which 3^n equals 243.

This implies that the shape has 2 layers of 2x2 squares each.    - Cutting this parallelepiped into a flat shape results in a net that should be composed of 2 times 2 = 4 times 2 = 8 squares plus 2 more squares for the 1×2 dimensions, totaling 10 squares.    - From the problem, we know that Dima cut one square, leaving us with 9 squares.

So we can write their savings as: Savings = Income - Expenditure For Uma: 5,000 = 20,000 - E_U E_U = 20,000 - 5,000 E_U = 15,000 For Bala: 5,000 = 15,000 - E_B E_B = 15,000 - 5,000 E_B = 10,000 Now we have the expenditures for both Uma and Bala. To find the ratio of their expenditures, we divide Uma's expenditure by Bala's expenditure: E_U / E_B = 15,000 / 10,000 E_U / E_B = 15 / 10 E_U / E_B = 3 / 2 So the ratio of their expenditures is boxed{3:2} ."},{"instruction":"Given that a, b, and c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively in triangle ABC, and c cos A + sqrt{3} c sin A  b  a = 0. 1.

Assume none of these points are collinear, i.e., no three points lie on a straight line. 2. Now, let's examine any line ( l ) that lies outside of our circle. Gradually move this line towards the points until it passes through one of them; let this point be ( A ). 3. Connect point ( A ) to all the other five points ( B, C, D, E,) and ( F ). This will create five rays: ( AB, AC, AD, AE,) and ( AF ). 4. At this stage, consider the angle between the two outermost rays amongst ( AB, AC, AD, AE,) and ( AF ). Without loss of generality, assume the angle ( BAF ).  5. We need to inspect two scenarios for the angle ( BAF ):    - **Case 1:** If (angle BAF leq 120^{circ}), then the five rays ( AB, AC, AD, AE, ) and ( AF ) divide the ( 120^{circ} ) angle into four sub-angles. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, since we are dividing ( 120^{circ} ) into four parts, at least one of these parts will be ( leq 30^{circ} ). Hence, there will be a triangle with ( A ) as one vertex that has at least one angle ( leq 30^{circ} ).    - **Case 2:** If (angle BAF > 120^{circ}), then in triangle ( ABF ), the remaining two angles (angle ABF ) and (angle AFB ) must sum to less than ( 60^{circ} ), since the sum of angles in any triangle is ( 180^{circ} ).

Define ( f(x_i) ) as the greatest prime factor of ( x_i ). We construct a sequence ( {x_i} ) where ( x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) ).    - **Step 1:** Show that ( x_i ) strictly decreases.      Since ( f(x_i) ) is the greatest prime factor of ( x_i ), it follows that ( f(x_i) geq 2 ). Therefore, ( x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) leq x_i - 2 ). This implies that ( x_i ) strictly decreases.    - **Step 2:** Show that the sequence terminates at 0.      Since ( x_i ) is strictly decreasing and always positive, it must eventually reach a value where ( x_i = f(x_i) ). At this point, ( x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) = 0 ). Therefore, there exists a natural number ( k(x_0) ) such that ( x_{k(x_0)+1} = 0 ).    Hence, we have proven that for any integer ( x_0 ) greater than 1, there exists a natural number ( k(x_0) ) such that ( x_{k(x_0)+1} = 0 ). 2. **Find the largest number in ( V(2), V(3), cdots, V(781) ) and give reasons:**    Let ( V(x_0) ) be the number of different numbers in ( f(x_0), f(x_1), cdots, f(x_{k(x_0)}) ).    - **Step 1:** Understand the behavior of ( f(x_i) ).      Since ( f(x_i) ) is the greatest prime factor of ( x_i ), and ( x_i ) strictly decreases, the sequence of greatest prime factors ( f(x_i) ) is non-decreasing.    - **Step 2:** Determine the maximum number of distinct prime factors.      The maximum number of distinct prime factors in the sequence ( f(x_0), f(x_1), cdots, f(x_{k(x_0)}) ) is determined by the largest ( x_0 ) in the range 2 to 781. The number 781 has the prime factorization ( 781 = 11 times 71 ). Therefore, the largest number of distinct prime factors in this range is the number of distinct prime factors of 781, which is 2.    Therefore, the largest number in ( V(2), V(3), cdots, V(781) ) is 2. The final answer is ( boxed{ 2 } )."},{"instruction":"The number of students in each section of a school is 24.

A 5% raise on 40 is calculated as follows: 5% of 40 = 0.05 * 40 = 2 So, his raise is 2 per hour. His new hourly wage is: 40 + 2 = 42 per hour Now, let's calculate his total earnings per week. We know he works for 5 days a week, but we don't know the number of hours he works per day yet. Let's call the number of hours he works per day \\"H\\". His weekly earnings are: 42 per hour * H hours per day * 5 days per week = 42H * 5 Now, let's calculate his total expenses per week. His old bills were 600 per week, and he added a 100 per week personal trainer, so his new weekly expenses are: 600 + 100 = 700 per week We know that he has 980 leftover after paying his bills, so his total earnings must cover his expenses plus the leftover amount. Therefore, his total earnings must be: 700 (expenses) + 980 (leftover) = 1680 Now we can set up the equation with his earnings and solve for H (the number of hours he works per day): 42H * 5 = 1680 Divide both sides by 5 to solve for 42H: 42H = 1680 / 5 42H = 336 Now, divide both sides by 42 to solve for H: H = 336 / 42 H = 8 Therefore, Mark works boxed{8}  hours per day."},{"instruction":"Mary set out on her bicycle to visit her sister, traveling at an average speed of 15 kilometers per hour.

By evaluating each option, a conclusion can be reached. **Step-by-step solution**: Step 1: Determine the foci and the equations of the asymptotes for the hyperbola ( frac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1 ). - The foci are located at ( (pm sqrt{5},0) ), which can be found using the formula ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ) where ( c = sqrt{5} ), ( a^2 = 4 ) (hence ( a = 2 )), and ( b^2 = 1 ) (so ( b = 1 )).    Step 2: Find the equations of the asymptotes. The asymptotes have the form ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ), which simplifies to ( y = pm frac{1}{2}x ) for this hyperbola. Step 3: Since the line ( l ) must be parallel to one of the asymptotes, its slope must be either ( frac{1}{2} ) or ( -frac{1}{2} ), and since it also must pass through one of the foci, we can use one of the foci to determine the equation of the line. Step 4: Examine each option to see which one meets both criteria: - Option A: ( y = -frac{1}{2}x + frac{sqrt{5}}{2} ) has the correct slope ( -frac{1}{2} ) and passes through the focus ( (sqrt{5},0) ). - Option B: ( y = frac{1}{2}x - sqrt{5} ) has the correct slope ( frac{1}{2} ) but does not pass through any of the foci. - Option C: ( y = 2x - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) does not have the correct slope, and does not match the slope of any asymptotes of the hyperbola. - Option D: ( y = -2x + sqrt{3} ) again does not have the correct slope and does not match the asymptotes' slope. Step 5: Based on the above analysis, Option A is the only option that satisfies all the requirements of the problem.

Machine _A_ can work for a maximum of 400 hours. 2. Machine _B_ can work for a maximum of 500 hours. The processing time per unit gives us two inequalities: 1. For Machine _A_: 1x + 2y leq 400 2. For Machine _B_: 2x + 1y leq 500 We must also account for the non-negativity restrictions, which read:  x geq 0, quad y geq 0  With the objective function and the constraints, this becomes a linear programming problem. To solve for the maximum revenue, we can graph the inequalities to find the feasible region and then determine the vertices, since the maximum revenue will be achieved at one of these vertices (corner points). Plotting the constraints: - For the Machine _A_ constraint: 1x + 2y = 400, we get points (400, 0) and (0, 200). - For the Machine _B_ constraint: 2x + 1y = 500, we get points (0, 500) and (250, 0). We also have the points (0, 0) according to non-negativity restrictions. The feasible region is a convex polygon formed by these points. The vertices we need to consider are (0, 0), (0, 200), (400, 0), and the intersection of the two lines: Solving for the intersection of 1x + 2y = 400 and 2x + 1y = 500: Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:  2x + 4y = 800,  subtracting the second equation from this, we get:  y = 300,  then substituting y = 300 into 2x + 1y = 500, we find:  x = 100.

At (0, 200): R = 0.3(0) + 0.2(200) = 40 thousand yuan 3. At (400, 0): R = 0.3(400) + 0.2(0) = 120 thousand yuan 4.

The derivative of this part with respect to x is f'(x) = -2x - a. For f(x) to be increasing, f'(x) > 0 should hold. Since the value at x = 1 is critical for ensuring that f(x) is increasing up to this point, we examine f'(1) = -2(1) - a = -2 - a > 0. This gives us our first inequality:    [ -2 - a > 0 implies a < -2. ] 2. **At the point x = 1,** we need to ensure the continuity and increasing nature of f(x). Thus, we compare the left-hand limit at x = 1 and the value of f(x) slightly greater than 1. For x = 1, the left part gives f(1) = -(1)^2 - a(1) - 5 = -1 - a - 5. For x > 1, f(x) close to 1 from the right is approximately frac{a}{1} = a. For f(x) to be increasing, the value just to the right at x = 1 should be greater than the value at x = 1, leading to:    [ -1 - a - 5 < a implies -6 - a < a implies -6 < 2a implies a > -3. ] 3. **For x > 1,** f(x) = frac{a}{x}. The derivative of this part is f'(x) = -frac{a}{x^2}. Since f(x) needs to increase, f'(x) > 0 for x > 1. This implies that:    [ -frac{a}{x^2} > 0 implies a < 0. ] Combining these conditions, we have: - From step 1 and step 3, a < -2 and a < 0, which both suggest that a must be negative. - From step 2, a > -3, which is the lower bound for a.

We can express ( 441 ) in two different ways using numbers from ( M ):    [    441 = 49 cdot 9    ]    and    [    441 = 21 cdot 21    ] 4.

Next, we need to check if ( 49, 9, ) and ( 21 ) are \\"simple\\" numbers. A number is \\"simple\\" if it cannot be expressed as a product of other numbers from ( M ) except for the trivial product involving 1.    - The factors of ( 49 ) are ( 1, 7, 49 ). Since ( 7 notin M ), ( 49 ) cannot be expressed as a product of other numbers from ( M ) except for ( 1 cdot 49 ). Thus, ( 49 ) is \\"simple\\".    - The factors of ( 9 ) are ( 1, 3, 9 ). Since ( 3 notin M ), ( 9 ) cannot be expressed as a product of other numbers from ( M ) except for ( 1 cdot 9 ). Thus, ( 9 ) is \\"simple\\".    - The factors of ( 21 ) are ( 1, 3, 7, 21 ). Since ( 3 notin M ) and ( 7 notin M ), ( 21 ) cannot be expressed as a product of other numbers from ( M ) except for ( 1 cdot 21 ). Thus, ( 21 ) is \\"simple\\". 6.

(3) When the selling price is set at a certain value, at what price will the daily sales profit be maximized? What is the maximum profit?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding the Function Expression Given the linear relationship between y (in kilograms) and x (in dollars per kilogram) as y=kx+b, we can use the given data to form a system of equations. From the table, we can pick any two points to form our equations. Let's use the points (65, 70) and (70, 60): 1. From x=65 and y=70, we get 70 = 65k + b. 2. From x=70 and y=60, we get 60 = 70k + b. Solving this system of equations: - Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 10 = -5k Rightarrow k = -2. - Substituting k = -2 into the first equation gives 70 = 65(-2) + b Rightarrow b = 200. Therefore, the function expression is y = -2x + 200.  Part 2: Selling Price for a Daily Sales Profit of 600 Let the daily sales profit be w. The profit formula, given the cost of 60 per kilogram, is w = y(x - 60). Substituting y = -2x + 200 into this formula gives: [ w = (-2x + 200)(x - 60) = -2x^2 + 320x - 12000 ] To ensure a daily sales profit of 600, we set w = 600: [ -2x^2 + 320x - 12000 = 600 Rightarrow -2x^2 + 320x - 12600 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find x = 70 or x = 90. Therefore, the selling price should be set at boxed{70 text{ or } 90} dollars per kilogram to achieve a sales profit of 600.  Part 3: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit From the profit equation w = -2x^2 + 320x - 12000, we can rewrite it in vertex form to find the maximum profit: [ w = -2(x^2 - 160x + 6000) = -2(x - 80)^2 + 800 ] The maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is when x = 80.

If 270 geese survived their second year, and no more than one goose hatched from each egg, how many goose eggs were originally laid at the pond?","output":"Let's work backwards from the 270 geese that survived their second year. First, we find out how many geese survived their first year. Since 3/5 did not survive their second year, it means that 2/5 did survive. So, if 270 geese are 2/5 of the geese that survived their first year, we can find the total number that survived the first year by dividing 270 by 2/5: Survived first year = 270 / (2/5) = 270 * (5/2) = 135 * 5 = 675 Now, we know that 5/6 of the goslings survived the six months before the end of the first year. So, to find out how many there were before the six months, we divide 675 by 5/6: Before six months = 675 / (5/6) = 675 * (6/5) = 135 * 6 = 810 Next, we know that 7/8 of the goslings survived the three months before the six months. So, to find out how many there were before the three months, we divide 810 by 7/8: Before three months = 810 / (7/8) = 810 * (8/7) = 810 * 8 / 7 = 1160 Then, we know that 3/4 of the goslings that hatched survived the first month. So, to find out how many hatched, we divide 1160 by 3/4: Hatched = 1160 / (3/4) = 1160 * (4/3) = 1160 * 4 / 3 = 1546.666... Since we can't have a fraction of a gosling, we'll round up to the nearest whole number because we were told that no more than one goose hatched from each egg, which means we can't have more goslings than eggs. So, we'll consider 1547 goslings hatched. Finally, we know that 4/5 of the eggs laid hatched successfully. So, to find out how many eggs were originally laid, we divide 1547 by 4/5: Eggs laid = 1547 / (4/5) = 1547 * (5/4) = 1547 * 5 / 4 = 1933.75 Again, since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Find the maximum value of y = f(x) + f^{1}(x).","output":"Given the function f(x) = 3^{x-1} + x - 1 for x in [0, 1], we can observe that the function is monotonically increasing over this interval because the derivative f'(x) = 3^{x-1} cdot ln(3) + 1 is always positive for x in [0, 1]. Therefore, f(x) will take its minimum value at x = 0 and its maximum value at x = 1 within the given domain. We can compute these as follows: - For x = 0: f(0) = 3^{-1} + 0 - 1 = frac{1}{3} - 1 = -frac{2}{3}. - For x = 1: f(1) = 3^{1-1} + 1 - 1 = 1. So the range of f(x) is [-frac{2}{3}, 1]. Consequently, since f(x) is monotonically increasing and continuous, its inverse function f^{-1}(x) is also monotonically increasing on the range of f(x). By the definition of an inverse function, for every x in the domain of f, f^{-1}(f(x)) = x. Thus, if f(x) spans from -frac{2}{3} to 1, the inverse f^{-1}(x) will span from 0 to 1, because these are the corresponding x values for f(x). Accordingly, the expression y = f(x) + f^{-1}(x) achieves its maximum possible value when both f(x) and f^{-1}(x) take their respective maximum values. We've established that the maximum value of f(x) in its domain is 1 and, by the same token, the maximum value of f^{-1}(x) will be its corresponding input when f(x) is at its maximum, which is 1.

Here is a step-by-step explanation and proof based on the reference statement. 1. **Definition and Initial Assumptions:**    - A projective transformation (or projectivity) on a line can generally be represented as a fractional linear transformation (also called a Möbius transformation) of the form:      [      f(x) = frac{ax + b}{cx + d},      ]      where (a), (b), (c), and (d) are constants and (ad - bc ne 0).    2. **Fixed Points:**    - Fixed points of the transformation (f(x)) are solutions to the equation:      [      f(x) = x,      ]      which implies:      [      frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = x.      ]     3. **Solving the Fixed Point Equation:**    - Cross-multiplying to clear the fraction:      [      ax + b = cx^2 + dx.      ]    - Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:      [      cx^2 + (d - a)x - b = 0.      ]   4. **Nature of the Quadratic Equation:**    - The given quadratic equation (cx^2 + (d-a)x - b = 0) can have at most two distinct solutions (roots) depending on the discriminant.      - The discriminant (Delta) is given by:        [        Delta = (d - a)^2 + 4bc.        ]      - If (Delta > 0), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.      - If (Delta = 0), the quadratic equation has one real root (a repeated root).      - If (Delta < 0), the quadratic equation has no real roots (in the context of a real projective line, this would imply no fixed points in the Euclidean sense, but we deal with real projective transformations). 5. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, a non-identity projective transformation (one where (a), (b), (c), and (d) are such that (ad - bc ne 0)) will have at most two fixed points on the line. Hence, it has been shown that a non-identity projective transformation of a line can have no more than two fixed points. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A company doubled its total mask production every month after the outbreak of Coronavirus due to increased demand.

We need to prove that the sum of the face angles of the inner polyhedral angle is less than that of the outer polyhedral angle. 2. **Transformation to Spherical Geometry:**     We can transform the problem into spherical geometry by considering the intersections of the edges of (O A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n}) and (O B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{m}) with a sphere of radius 1 centered at (O). This reduces the problem to considering spherical polygons. 3. **Spherical Angles:**     Let the spherical polygons for the inner and outer polyhedral angles be denoted as (A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n}) and (B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{m}) respectively. 4. **Edge Intersections:**     Let (P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n}) be the points of intersection of the rays (A_{1} A_{2}, A_{2} A_{3}, ldots, A_{n} A_{1}) with the sides of the spherical polygon (B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{m}) such that each (A_{i} P_{i}) lies within a corresponding arc on the larger spherical polygon formed by (B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{m}). 5. **Incorporation of Theorem:**     According to the task (likely reference to Theorem 5.17), it gives:     [     sum A_{i} A_{i+1} + sum A_{i+1} P_{i+1} = sum A_{i} P_{i} < sum A_{i} P_{i-1} + sum ellleft(P_{i-1}, P_{i}right)     ]     where (ellleft(P_{i-1}, P_{i}right)) denotes the length of the arc on the spherical polygon (B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{m}) enclosed by the angle (P_{i-1} A_{i} P_{i}). 6. **Summation of Inequalities:**     Summing up these inequalities over all edges, we get:     [     sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} P_{i} < sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} P_{i-1} + sum_{i=1}^{n} ellleft(P_{i-1}, P_{i}right)     ]     which indicates that the total sum of the arc lengths representing the flat angles of the inner spherical polygon is less than that of the outer spherical polygon. 7. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, the sum of the plane (face) angles of the inner polyhedral angle must be less than the sum of the plane (face) angles of the outer polyhedral angle.

For ②, the converse of the given statement would be \\"If A < B, then cos A > cos B\\". This is true because as the angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees in a right-angled triangle, the cosine of the angle decreases. Therefore, the converse is indeed a true statement, which means that statement ② is incorrect as it claimed that the converse is a false proposition. For ③, if three numbers a, b, c are in geometric progression, then by definition, b^2=ac. As a consequence, b=±sqrt{ac}. However, if a = b = c = 0, then b=sqrt{ac} is satisfied but a, b, and c do not form a geometric progression since you cannot have a common ratio with all terms being zero.

We systematically evaluate the inequality for all integer values of (b) from 1 to 9:    - For (b = 1): ( a leq -8 ) (no possible (a), so 0 valid pairs)    - For (b = 2): ( a leq -6 ) (no possible (a), so 0 valid pairs)    - For (b = 3): ( a leq -4 ) (no possible (a), so 0 valid pairs)    - For (b = 4): ( a leq -2 ) (no possible (a), so 0 valid pairs)    - For (b = 5): ( a leq 0 ) (no possible (a), so 0 valid pairs)    - For (b = 6): ( a leq 2 ) (possible: ( a = 1, 2 ); 2 valid pairs)    - For (b = 7): ( a leq 4 ) (possible: ( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 ); 4 valid pairs)    - For (b = 8): ( a leq 6 ) (possible: ( a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ); 6 valid pairs)    - For (b = 9): ( a leq 8 ) (possible: ( a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ); 8 valid pairs) 5. Summing up the valid pairs that do not satisfy the original inequality, we get:    [    2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20 text{ pairs}    ] 6. Now, using the complement rule, we find the number of pairs that satisfy the inequality (a - 2b + 10 > 0):    [    text{Number of valid pairs} = 81 - 20 = 61    ] 7.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Constructing a Path:**    - Start by picking any vertex ( A ) in ( G ).    - Construct a path from ( A ) by traversing along the edges of the graph and labeling them consecutively with ( 1, 2, 3, ldots ).    - Continue this path until you reach a vertex ( B ) such that there are no more unlabeled edges. 2. **Verifying gcd at Vertex ( A ):**    - Since vertex ( A ) is the starting point, it has the edge labeled ( 1 ).    - The gcd at vertex ( A ) must be ( 1 ) since one of its edges is labeled ( 1 ). 3. **Ensuring gcd-1 Along the Path:**    - Move from vertex ( A ) to vertex ( B ), labeling each edge sequentially.    - Any vertex ( V ) on this path (other than ( A ) and ( B )) will have edges labeled with consecutive numbers.     - Consecutive numbers ( n ) and ( n+1 ) are always coprime, i.e., ( gcd(n, n+1) = 1 ). 4. **Handling Vertex B:**    - If vertex ( B ) has only one edge, nothing needs to be checked as there's no pair of edges to consider for gcd.    - If vertex ( B ) has more edges that have already been labeled, we ensure from previous steps that all edges connected to ( B ) retain ( gcd = 1 ). 5. **Repeating the Process:**    - Identify any other vertex ( C ) in the graph which has an unlabeled edge.    - Repeat the path labeling process from ( C ), labeling newly encountered edges with consecutive numbers starting from the next available label. 6. **Termination of the Procedure:**    - Continue the process until all edges of the graph ( G ) have been labeled.    - Since the graph is finite and connected, this process will eventually label all edges while maintaining the required gcd condition at each vertex. # Conclusion: By continuously creating paths and labeling edges consecutively, we ensure that every vertex with multiple connecting edges has at least two edges with labels that are consecutive, hence guaranteeing that their gcd is ( 1 ).

State a possible rule for deciding which candles to light on day ( i ).","output":"To determine the values of ( n ) for which it is possible to light the candles as described, we need to understand how the candles are used over the ( n ) days.  1. **Total Candle Hours Calculation**:    - The total number of candle-hours needed is the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2}      ]    - This is because, on day ( i ), exactly ( i ) candles are lit and each burns for exactly one hour. 2. **Individual Candle Usage**:    - Since there are ( n ) candles and each candle must burn out exactly at the end of the ( n )-th day, we need to determine how long each candle is burning.    - If ( n ) days were allowed, each candle would have burned an identical amount of time. Let ( t ) be the total time each candle burns. This time must satisfy:      [      t times n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}      ]    - Solving for ( t ), we get:      [      t = frac{n+1}{2}      ]    - ( t ) must be an integer because it represents the total hours the candle has burned. Therefore, ( frac{n+1}{2} ) must be an integer, implying that ( n+1 ) must be even. Thus, ( n ) must be **odd**. 3. **Rule for Lighting Candles**:    - Let's devise a rule for lighting the candles:      - If ( i leq frac{n}{2} ), light candle number ( 1 ) up to ( i ).      - If ( i > frac{n}{2} ), light ( i ) candles starting from ( n ) downwards.      - These pairs of days and the final day where all candles are lit ensure each candle burns for exactly ( frac{n+1}{2} ) hours.     4. **Example**:    - Consider ( n = 5 ) (since 5 is odd):      * Day 1: Light candle 1.      * Day 2: Light candles 1 and 2.      * Day 3: Light candles 3, 4, and 5.      * Day 4: Light candles 2, 3, 4, and 5.      * Day 5: Light all candles (1 to 5).    - Each candle burns for exactly ( 3 ) hours (i.e., the required ( frac{5+1}{2} ) hours).

Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Train's speed - Man's speed Relative speed = 68 kmph - 8 kmph Relative speed = 60 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) because the time given is in seconds. We use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s: Relative speed (m/s) = 60 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed (m/s) = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed (m/s) = 60 * (5 / 18) Relative speed (m/s) = 60 * 5 / 18 Relative speed (m/s) = 300 / 18 Relative speed (m/s) = 16.666666666666668 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to pass the man to find the length of the train: Length of the train = Relative speed * Time Length of the train = 16.666666666666668 m/s * 11.999040076793857 s Length of the train ≈ 200 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{200}  meters."},{"instruction":"A marathon is 26 miles.

So, we have: [boxed{x = 6, y = 0.4}]  Part 2: Comparing the Cost-Effectiveness of Two Discount Schemes Let's denote the number of sheets of rice paper to be purchased by m (where m > 200). - **Scheme A**: The cost calculation is as follows: [50 times 6 + 0.4 times (m - 50) = 300 + 0.4m - 20 = 0.4m + 280] - **Scheme B**: The cost calculation is: [50 times 6 + 0.4 times 200 + 0.4 times 0.8 times (m - 200) = 300 + 80 + 0.32m - 64 = 0.32m + 316] To find which scheme is more cost-effective, we compare the costs: - **For Scheme A to be more cost-effective**: [0.4m + 280 < 0.32m + 316] [0.08m < 36] [m < 450] - **For both schemes to have the same cost**: [0.4m + 280 = 0.32m + 316] [0.08m = 36] [m = 450] - **For Scheme B to be more cost-effective**: [0.4m + 280 > 0.32m + 316] [m > 450] Therefore, the conclusion is: [boxed{text{Scheme A is more cost-effective for } 200 < m < 450, text{ both are equal at } m = 450, text{ and Scheme B is more cost-effective for } m > 450.}]"},{"instruction":"Let  B(n)  be the number of ones in the base two expression for the positive integer  n.  Determine whether   exp left( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{ B(n)}{n(n+1)} right)   is a rational number.","output":"1. We start by considering the function ( B(n) ), which counts the number of ones in the binary representation of the positive integer ( n ). 2. We need to evaluate the expression:    [    exp left( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{B(n)}{n(n+1)} right)    ] 3. First, we analyze the contribution of each digit in the binary representation of ( n ) to ( B(n) ). The last digit (least significant bit) contributes to ( B(n) ) if ( n ) is odd. Therefore, the sum of contributions from the last digit is:    [    sum_{substack{n=1  n text{ odd}}}^{infty} frac{1}{n(n+1)}    ] 4. We can rewrite the sum for odd ( n ) as:    [    frac{1}{1 cdot 2} + frac{1}{3 cdot 4} + frac{1}{5 cdot 6} + cdots    ] 5. This series can be simplified using partial fractions:    [    frac{1}{n(n+1)} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}    ] 6. Therefore, the series becomes:    [    left( frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{2} right) + left( frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} right) + left( frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} right) + cdots    ] 7. This is a telescoping series, and it sums to:    [    1 - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} + cdots = log(2)    ]    (This result follows from the Taylor series expansion of (log(1+x)) evaluated at (x=1)). 8. Next, we consider the contribution of the next-to-last digit. This digit contributes to ( B(n) ) if ( n equiv 2 ) or ( 3 pmod{4} ). The sum of contributions from the next-to-last digit is:    [    sum_{substack{n=1  n equiv 2,3 pmod{4}}}^{infty} frac{1}{n(n+1)}    ] 9. This series can be written as:    [    frac{1}{2 cdot 3} + frac{1}{3 cdot 4} + frac{1}{6 cdot 7} + frac{1}{7 cdot 8} + cdots    ] 10. Using partial fractions again, we get:     [     frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{8} + cdots = frac{1}{2} log(2)     ] 11. By repeating this argument for each digit in the binary representation, we find that the ( n )-th last digit contributes:     [     frac{1}{2^{n-1}} log(2)     ] 12. Summing these contributions, we get:     [     sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{n-1}} log(2) = log(2) sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{n-1}}     ] 13. The geometric series (sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{n-1}}) sums to:     [     sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^{n-1}} = 2     ] 14. Therefore, the entire sum is:     [     log(2) cdot 2 = 2 log(2)     ] 15. Finally, we need to evaluate the exponential of this sum:     [     exp left( 2 log(2) right) = exp left( log(4) right) = 4     ] 16. Since 4 is a rational number, we conclude that the given expression is a rational number.

Thus, if the side length is 8, the altitude (which is opposite the 60^circ angle) can be calculated using the ratio 1:sqrt{3}:2 for 30-60-90 triangles. The altitude is frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 8 = 4sqrt{3}. The y-coordinate of the base of the triangle is 6, and the altitude is 4sqrt{3}.

We need to find the largest sum that cannot be formed using these coins. Let us outline and prove two major claims that will help us solve this problem.  Claim 1: For any (r in {1, 2, ldots, 3n-2}), denote by (m_r) the smallest decomposable number which leaves a remainder (r) when divided by (3n-1). 1. If (s mod (3n-1) = r), then for (s geq m_r), the sum (s) can be formed using the given coin denominations. If (s < m_r), (s) cannot be formed. 2. Suppose (s < m_r) and the sum (s) can be formed using the coin denominations. By removing necessary (3n-1) coins, we would obtain a decomposable sum smaller than (m_r) with the same remainder (r), contradicting the minimality of (m_r).  Claim 2: The values (3k mod (3n-1)) cover all remainders ({1, 2, ldots, 3n-2}) as (k) varies from (1) to (3n-2). To see why, note that: - If ( (3k - 3k') div (3n-1) ), then ( (k - k') div (3n-1) ). - Since (left| k - k' right| leq 3n-2 ), it follows that ( k = k'). Thus, it covers all remainders, ensuring (3k mod (3n-1) = r) for some (k).  Largest Non-attainable Sum: (6n^2 + 4n - 5). To find ( max {m_1, ldots, m_{3n-2}} - (3n-1) ): 1. From the equations: [ begin{align*} 6n+1 & = 2(3n-1) + 3,  6n+4 & = 2(3n-1) + 6,  6n+7 & = 2(3n-1) + 9, end{align*} ] we observe the remainders (3), (6), and (9) modulo (3n-1). 2. For any ( r in {1, 2, ldots, 3n-2} ), let ( 3k ) provide the remainder (r). The sum (3k) can be expressed with minimal coin combinations:    [    m_r = 3k + leftlceil frac{k}{3} rightrceil 2(3n-1).    ] 3. For the highest value, let (k = 3n-2):    [    begin{align*}    m_{r_{max}} & = 3(3n-2) + leftlceil frac{3n-2 + 2}{3} rightrceil 2(3n-1)                  & = 9n - 6 + 2n(3n-1)                  & = 6n^2 + 7n - 6.    end{align*}    ] Thus, the largest non-attainable sum is: [ 6n^2 + 7n - 6 - (3n-1) = 6n^2 + 4n - 5. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{6n^2 + 4n - 5} ]"},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements about the monomial frac{3x{y}^{2}}{5} is correct?

This means there exist infinitely many primes ( q_i ) and corresponding integers ( alpha_i ) such that ( q_i mid P(alpha_i) ). 3. **Form of ( f(x) ):**    Let ( f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{M} prod_{j=1}^{i} a_j^{f_j(x)} ), where each ( a_j ) is a positive integer and each ( f_j(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. 4. **Choosing a large prime ( q_i ):**    Choose a large prime ( q_i ) such that ( q_i > a_j ) for all ( j ).

Considering b=a pmod{10} and comparing the numbers in the four options, we arrive at the answer.   This question tests knowledge of the congruence theorem and the binomial theorem.

(2) From (1), when aleqslant 0, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing. In this case, the function has at most one zero point, which does not meet the requirement. Therefore, a > 0.

The rise in the water level in the tank was 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters (since 1 meter = 100 cm). The volume of water displaced by all 50 men is equal to the volume of the tank's increase in water level, which can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = length × width × height In this case, the length is 40 m, the width is 20 m, and the height is the rise in water level, which is 0.25 m. Volume = 40 m × 20 m × 0.25 m Volume = 800 m² × 0.25 m Volume = 200 m³ So, the total volume of water displaced by all 50 men is 200 cubic meters. Now, to find the average displacement of water by a man, we divide the total volume of water displaced by the number of men: Average displacement per man = Total volume displaced / Number of men Average displacement per man = 200 m³ / 50 men Average displacement per man = 4 m³ Therefore, the average displacement of water by a man is boxed{4}  cubic meters."},{"instruction":"Let B be the upper vertex of the ellipse C: frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}+frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=1left(a gt b gt 0right).

From the total fence length, we have the equation for perimeter, ( 2l + 2w = 380 ) which simplifies to ( l + w = 190 ). The area ( A ) of the rectangle is given by ( A = lw ). Replacing ( w ) from the perimeter relationship, we have ( w = 190 - l ). Thus, the area becomes: [  A = l(190 - l) = 190l - l^2  ] We complete the square to find the maximum area: [  A = -(l^2 - 190l) = -(l^2 - 190l + 9025 - 9025) = -(l - 95)^2 + 9025  ] The maximum area occurs when ( -(l - 95)^2 ) is minimized, which is when ( l = 95 ).

The area of the four walls of the room can be calculated by adding the areas of the two pairs of opposite walls.

The total area of the four walls is: 2 * (25 * 12) + 2 * (x * 12) = 2 * 300 + 2 * 12x = 600 + 24x square feet. Now, we need to subtract the area of the door and the three windows from the total area of the walls to get the area that needs to be whitewashed: Area of the door = 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet. Area of one window = 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet. Area of three windows = 3 * 12 = 36 square feet. Total area to be subtracted (door + three windows) = 18 + 36 = 54 square feet. The area to be whitewashed is: 600 + 24x - 54 = 546 + 24x square feet. The cost of whitewashing per square foot is Rs. 2, so the total cost is: Cost = (546 + 24x) * 2. We are given that the total cost is Rs. 1812, so we can set up the equation: (546 + 24x) * 2 = 1812. Divide both sides by 2 to simplify: 546 + 24x = 906.

We need to show that (x) is an integer. 2. **Establish that (x) is an algebraic integer:**    Since (x^3 - x) and (x^4 - x) are integers, (x) must be a root of the polynomials (t^3 - t - a_1) and (t^4 - t - a_2) where (a_1 = x^3 - x) and (a_2 = x^4 - x). These polynomials have integer coefficients, so (x) is an algebraic integer. 3. **Minimal polynomial and degree considerations:**    Let (p(t)) be the minimal polynomial of (x) over the integers. Since (x) is an algebraic integer, (p(t)) is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. The degree of (p(t)) must be at most 3 because (x) is a root of the polynomial (t^3 - t - a_1). 4. **Assume (p(t)) is not of degree 1:**    We want to show that (p(t)) is of degree 1. Assume for contradiction that (p(t)) is of degree 2 or 3. 5. **Construct polynomials (p_1(t)) and (p_2(t)):**    Define (p_1(t) = t^3 - t - a_1) and (p_2(t) = t^4 - t - a_2). Since (x) is a root of both, (p_1(x) = 0) and (p_2(x) = 0). 6. **Form a new polynomial:**    Consider the polynomial (p_2(t) - tp_1(t) = t^2 + t(a_1 - 1) - a_2). This polynomial must be divisible by the minimal polynomial (p(t)). 7. **Degree analysis:**    If (p(t)) is of degree 2, then (p(t)) must divide (t^2 + t(a_1 - 1) - a_2). This implies that (t^2 + t(a_1 - 1) - a_2) is the minimal polynomial. 8. **Divisibility conditions:**    Since (t^2 + t(a_1 - 1) - a_2) must divide both (t^3 - t - a_1) and (t^4 - t - a_2), we can substitute (t = 0) and (t = 1) to get:    [    a_1 - a_2 quad text{and} quad a_2 quad text{must divide} quad (a_1, a_2)    ]    This implies (a_2 mid a_1) and (a_1 - a_2 = pm a_2 implies a_1 = 2a_2). 9. **Calculate the gcd:**    Consider the gcd of the polynomials:    [    gcd(x^3 - x - a_1, x^4 - x - a_2) = gcd(x^2 + x(a_1 - 1) - a_2, x^3 - x - 2a_2)    ]    Simplifying further:    [    gcd(x^2 + x(a_1 - 1) - a_2, x^2(1 - a_1) + x(a_2 - 1) - 2a_2)    ]    For the gcd to be of degree 1, the coefficients must satisfy:    [    (1 - a_1, a_2 - 1, -2a_2) = C(1, a_1 - 1, -a_2)    ]    for some constant (C). Given (C = 2), we get (a_1 = -1) and (a_2 = -3), which contradicts (a_1 = 2a_2). 10. **Conclusion:**     Since the assumption that (p(t)) is of degree 2 leads to a contradiction, (p(t)) must be of degree 1.

Consider the case where n = 2^k for some natural number k. We need to establish a winning strategy for Petya:    - If after Vasya's move the chip is at position m = 2^{a} (2b + 1), then Petya should name the number m = 2^{a}.    - After this, Vasya moves the chip either to position m = 2^{a+1} (b+1) or position m = 2^{a+1} b (modulo n = 2^k).     - In either case, the highest power of 2 dividing the position number will increase by at least 1.    - Consequently, after at most k moves, the position number will be divisible by n = 2^k, which is possible only if the chip is at position 0.

First, let's focus on the left side of the equation: - To eliminate the decimal in the denominator of frac{x}{0.3}, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 (since 0.3 times 10 = 3), which gives us frac{10x}{3}. Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation: - For the fraction frac{1.2-0.3x}{0.2}, we also want to eliminate the decimal in the denominator. Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 10 (because 0.2 times 10 = 2) gives us frac{12-3x}{2}.

How many tyûdejó subsets are there of the set {1,2,3, ldots, 10}?","output":"1. First, we acknowledge the condition for a subset to be tyú-de-jó: no two elements in the subset can have a difference of 2. 2. Next, we observe that the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 10}) can be divided into two subsets: the even numbers ({2, 4, 6, 8, 10}) and the odd numbers ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}). 3. We note that the differences of 2 within the sets of all even numbers or all odd numbers must be avoided independently. Additionally, combining one tyú-de-jó subset of odd numbers with any tyú-de-jó subset of even numbers will still produce a valid tyú-de-jó subset of the original set. 4. To find the number of tyú-de-jó subsets within each of the even and odd number subsets, we first look at the odd numbers subset ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}). 5. Starting with the smallest odd number, consider the subset ({1}).     - There are 2 possible subsets: ({}), ({1}). 6. Now, consider the subset ({1, 3}).    - If 1 is in the subset, 3 cannot be.    - If 1 is not in the subset, 3 can be included or excluded.    - Thus, the subsets are ({}), ({1}), ({3}), which gives us 3 subsets. 7. Extending this logic to the subset ({1, 3, 5}):    - If 3 is in the subset, 5 cannot be.    - If 3 is not in the subset, we consider the valid subsets of ({1}) and append ({5}).    - Thus the subsets are ({}), ({1}), ({3}), ({5}), ({1, 5}), giving us 5 subsets. 8. Extending further to ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}), we continue following the above patterns, recognizing that this series grows according to the Fibonacci sequence:    [    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)    ]    - Thus we have (F(3) = 2), (F(5) = 5), (F(6) = 8), (F(10) = 13). 9. Likewise, applying the same logic to the even subset ({2, 4, 6, 8, 10}), we note that the structure and the growth pattern of subsets remain the same as above. Each subset number follows the same sequence. 10. Therefore, both subsets ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}) and ({2, 4, 6, 8, 10}) each have 13 valid tyú-de-jó subsets. 11. The total number of tyú-de-jó subsets of ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 10}) is the product of the counts from the even and odd subsets:    [    text{Total count} = 13 times 13 = 169    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{169} ]"},{"instruction":"A and B two people are throwing n fair coins.X and Y are the times they get heads.

The sum in the red box is 2, and the sum in the blue box is 1, which satisfies the condition ( 2 times 1 = 2 ).    Therefore, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement is true for ( n = k ). That is, for ( k ) cards, we can place the cards in such a way that the sum of the numbers in the red box is twice the sum of the numbers in the blue box.    We need to show that the statement holds for ( n = k+1 ).    - Andrés has ( (k+1) + 1 = k+2 ) cards.    - The sum of the numbers on the cards is ( 3(k+1) = 3k + 3 ).    Assume for contradiction that we cannot place the cards in the required manner.    Consider the following cases for the values of the cards:    - If there exists a card with the number 3, we can remove this card and apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining ( k+1 ) cards, whose sum is ( 3k ). By the induction hypothesis, we can place these ( k+1 ) cards in the required manner. Then, we can place the card with 3 in the red box, and the condition will still hold.    - If there are no cards with the number 3, then all cards must be either 1 or 2.       - If there is a card with the number 1, then the sum of the remaining ( k+1 ) cards is ( 3k + 2 ). This is a contradiction because the sum of ( k+1 ) positive integers cannot be ( 3k + 2 ).      - If there are two cards with the number 1, then the sum of the remaining ( k ) cards is ( 3k + 1 ). This is a contradiction because the sum of ( k ) positive integers cannot be ( 3k + 1 ).      - If there is a card with the number 2, then the sum of the remaining ( k+1 ) cards is ( 3k + 1 ). This is a contradiction because the sum of ( k+1 ) positive integers cannot be ( 3k + 1 ).      - If there are two cards with the number 2, then the sum of the remaining ( k ) cards is ( 3k - 1 ). This is a contradiction because the sum of ( k ) positive integers cannot be ( 3k - 1 ).
