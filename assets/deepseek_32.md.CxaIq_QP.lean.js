Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km). The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The \\"Serum Run\\" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome. A:","output":"Task Explanation: This task requests the creation of a question that appears to be relevant to a provided passage about dog sledding in Alaska, but which cannot be answered based on the information given in the passage. The question must be unanswerable due to one of the following methods suggested in the instructions: needing information outside of the passage, containing constraints not mentioned in the passage, replacing an entity/number/date in the passage with something else, or by manipulating a question that can be answered from the passage via replacing words with antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Solution: Applying the mentioned suggestion iii (replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and using it in the question), a possible unanswerable question could be: \\"How many miles is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Fairbanks?\\" This question appears relevant as it talks about a race mentioned in the passage.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, we can extract several key pieces of information related to the California State Senate and its role within the California State Legislature. The sentence provides the following data: 1. Geographical location: The sentence tells us that the focus is on the state of California, which is located in the United States of America. California is one of the fifty states in the country, and the most populous one. 2. Governmental structure: The sentence indicates that California has a state legislature. This suggests that California has a government system that follows the principles of federalism, with powers divided between the federal government and individual state governments. The state legislature is responsible for enacting laws at the state level and represents the legislative branch of the California state government. 3. Bicameral system: The mention of both the California State Senate and the California State Legislature in the same sentence implies that California has a bicameral legislature. A bicameral legislature is characterized by having two separate chambers, or houses, within its structure. In California's case, the two chambers are the State Senate and the State Assembly. 4. Role of the California State Senate: The sentence states that the California State Senate is a part of the California State Legislature. This tells us that it is one of the two chambers within the legislative branch. The Senate plays a crucial role in creating and passing legislation alongside the State Assembly. Senators are responsible for representing their respective constituencies within the state and working on legislation affecting California and its citizens. 5. Legislative process: Since the California State Senate is part of the California State Legislature, we can infer that it is involved in the legislative process. This entails proposing, discussing, amending, and voting on bills (proposed laws) before they are sent to the Governor for approval or veto. If the Governor approves the bill, it becomes state law; if not, the Legislature can attempt to override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers (Senate and Assembly). In summary, the sentence provides valuable information about the government structure in California, highlighting the state's bicameral legislature, the role of the State Senate, and the legislative process as a whole."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A wakeboarder is performing a trick on a rail.\\" is it true that \\"Nobody is performing.\\"?

Article:","output":"Title: Bullying and Discrimination Allegations Surface at Healthcare Facility Introduction: Healthcare professionals are expected to provide their patients with the highest possible quality of care. Part of that mandate includes fostering an environment free from prejudices that could potentially compromise the wellbeing of those they treat. However, recent allegations against two nurses, Sharon Turner and Tracy White, have brought attention to a darker truth: bullying and discrimination are far from extinct in today's healthcare systems. Bullying Claims at Hospital: Sharon Turner and Tracy White have been accused of engaging in aggressive and intimidating behavior towards their fellow staff members. This type of bullying environment not only has a detrimental effect on staff morale, but can also trickle down and impact patient care outcomes. It is essential that hospitals and healthcare facilities have a strict zero-tolerance policy against such behavior, ensuring that all employees feel safe and supported in their work environment. Falsely Logging Patient Discharges: Among several concerning allegations lodged against Turner and White are claims they falsified records to meet specific administrative targets. These targets specified that patients were to be dealt with and discharged from the healthcare facility within four hours. By manipulating and logging false information, Turner and White allegedly sought to give the appearance of a more efficient and effective healthcare system, despite reality painting a contrasting picture. This intentional deception could have serious ramifications on both patient safety and the allocation of resources. Racially Abusive Conduct: Turner is accused of continuously making derogatory statements towards an Asian doctor working at the facility. The nurse allegedly referred to the physician as \\"Osama's mate,\\" and displayed blatant racism and xenophobia in doing so. This type of behavior is not only unacceptable in any environment, but it has no place in the healthcare sector, where collaboration among colleagues is crucial for delivering top-quality medical care. Discrimination Against Black Patients: In addition to their other transgressions, Turner and White have been accused of forcing black patients to wait for their medical assistance for an extended period, longer than any other ethnicity. This form of discriminatory behavior not only goes against the ethical principles that underpin healthcare, but it also constitutes a breach of patients' rights. The allegations, if proven true, would suggest that these nurses failed in their duty to provide unbiased and equal care to all patients, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Conclusion: It has been well-established that the provision of an inclusive and equitable healthcare environment is crucial for the wellbeing of both patients and staff. The bullying and discrimination allegations against Sharon Turner and Tracy White force us to confront troubling realities that persist in healthcare systems today. It is incumbent upon healthcare providers and authorities to address and eliminate such destructive behaviors, ensuring a supportive environment where both patients and staff can feel respected and safe. The swift and transparent investigation of these allegations will send a clear message that there is no room for discrimination and prejudice in the healthcare sector."},{"instruction":"Bunlar arasında Avrupa Havacılık Savunma ve Uzay Kuruluşu ile imzalanmış 1 milyar avroluk sınır güvenliği anlaşması, Fransız inşaat firması BTP Vinci ile imzalanmış 480 milyon avroluk otoyol yapım sözleşmesi ve ABD'li Bechtel ile imzalanmış 2,5 milyar avroluk otoyol inşa anlaşması bulunuyor.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be? Available choices: (A). description (B). entity (C). abbreviation (D). human (E). numeric (F). location A:","output":"The Immaculate Conception is a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church that refers to the belief that the Virgin Mary was conceived without the stain of original sin. This concept is often mistaken as the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, but it is actually about the conception of Mary herself. The idea is rooted in the teachings of early Christianity and has developed over time with various theologians examining and supporting this belief. To answer your question, the Immaculate Conception would be best described as an option (B) Entity. While it is a concept and belief within the Roman Catholic faith, it is also associated with a specific individual, the Virgin Mary. The Immaculate Conception would not be a description, abbreviation, human, numeric value, or a location. Let's explore further details about the Immaculate Conception: 1. Origins: The belief in the Immaculate Conception dates back to the early centuries of Christianity. Early Church Fathers such as St. Justin Martyr and St. Irenaeus wrote about the idea of Mary being free from sin. Over time, theologians began to explore the concept further and develop their understanding. 2. Theological Development: The theologian John Duns Scotus (1266-1308) played a pivotal role in deepening the understanding of the Immaculate Conception. He argued that in order to be a suitable mother for Jesus, Mary had to be completely free from sin, which meant she was conceived without original sin. He believed that God, knowing Mary's role in salvation, preserved her from the original sin at the moment of her conception. 3. Papal Infallibility: In 1854, Pope Pius IX defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus. He stated that the Virgin Mary was \\"preserved free from all guilt of original sin\\" from the first moment of her conception. This declaration marked the formal acceptance of the belief by the Roman Catholic Church. 4. Feast of the Immaculate Conception: Each year, on December 8th, Roman Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. This is a holy day of obligation in some countries, meaning that Catholics are required to attend Mass. The feast honors the sinless conception of Mary and her unique role in the story of salvation. In summary, the Immaculate Conception is an entity within the Roman Catholic faith, referring to the belief that the Virgin Mary was conceived without the stain of original sin. This doctrine has evolved over time and has been reinforced by theologians and the Church's teachings, culminating in the formal declaration by Pope Pius IX in 1854. Today, Roman Catholics continue to revere and celebrate the Virgin Mary's unique role in Christian history through the Feast of the Immaculate Conception."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

They wanted to see which fire would last longer. Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. Step 1: Analyze the hint provided. The hint states that a large log burns slowly, while small twigs burn much more quickly due to the increased surface area they provide.

She buys 2 math books, 3 art books, and 6 science books, for a total of 30. If both the math and science books cost 3 each, what was the cost of each art book? Your thoughts:","output":"To calculate the cost of each art book, we can first determine the total cost of the math and science books that Alicia bought and then find out how much she spent on the art books. After that, we can calculate the price of a single art book by dividing the total cost of art books by the number of art books purchased. Here's the step-by-step calculation: 1. Calculate the total cost of math and science books: - Math books: 2 books × 3 each = 6 - Science books: 6 books × 3 each = 18 2. Find the combined cost of math and science books: 6 (math books) + 18 (science books) = 24 3. Calculate the total cost Alicia spent on art books: She spent a total of 30 on books; thus, the cost of the art books is the difference between the total amount spent and the cost of math and science books: 30 (total amount spent) - 24 (math and science books) = 6 4. Find the cost of each art book: Alicia bought three art books, so we can now divide the total spent on art books by the number of art books: 6 (total cost of art books) ÷ 3 (number of art books) = 2 Therefore, each art book cost Alicia 2."},{"instruction":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: BUYER BEWARE: Amazon bait & switch Review: Note: This is a review of Amazon's handling of the sale of this item...it is not a review of the product itself.I ordered this item on a day when Amazon had it \\"in stock\\" and at an excellent price.

Ads have been springing up on eBay and Craigslist for iPhones and iPads pre-loaded with the game, with ridiculously high asking prices attached. One auction climbed to more than 250,000, with 76 bids, according to the Telegraph. Most similar listings are for much less than that—a quick search as of this writing revealed one for 5,000 alongside another at 3.29—but there's an undeniable rush under way to cash in. But eBay is taking down the listings, because site policy requires electronics to be restored to factory settings. Craigslist sellers don't have that problem, but to keep the game playable they'll need to hand over their phones with their Apple IDs still attached—which means risking having their accounts hacked, i Love Flappy Birds points out. One Washington, DC, man has devised a clever work-around: He's renting his phone out for 1 a minute, he tells the Telegraph. \\"Truthfully, I think Flappy Bird is a dumb game that people are way too hyped up about,\\" he says. \\"My personal high score is six.\\" (No word if he's had any takers yet.)

When it disappeared, people still wanted to play Flappy Bird, but they didn't know how. Some smart people decided to sell their iPhones and iPads that already had the Flappy Bird game on it. They put these devices on websites like eBay and Craigslist and asked for a lot of money. Some of these people asked for silly prices, like 250,000, which is more money than most people have! Even though the prices were really high, other people were still excited about these devices and wanted to buy them. Many wanted to buy an iPhone or iPad with Flappy Bird, so they could play the game again. But there was a little problem with this. The website eBay didn't like that people were selling their iPhones and iPads with the Flappy Bird game on them. The website has rules that say electronics like these should be changed back to how they were when they were first made. So, eBay started taking down these devices from their website. The people who were trying to sell their devices on Craigslist didn't have this problem, but they had another one. To keep the Flappy Bird game working, they would have to give away their phones with their special Apple IDs still there. But doing this was dangerous because someone could try to take their private information. But, one clever man in Washington, DC, found a different way to let people play Flappy Bird without giving away his device. He decided to rent his phone to people for 1 a minute, so they could play the game without buying the phone. This man wasn't a big fan of the game, and he only had a high score of six. But he thought that other people might still want to play Flappy Bird, and maybe his idea could help them.

Papich (Aden Young), are on a mission to assassinate a Panamanian rebel leader in the jungle. Because they are extracted in daylight instead of at night, Papich is killed by a sniper. Beckett runs back under fire to carry Papich's body to the helicopter. Later, Beckett is paired up with an inexperienced civilian, Richard Miller (Zane), to eliminate a rebel general financed by a Colombian drug lord. Miller is a SWAT team sharpshooter, with no combat experience or confirmed kills to his name. While on the way to the staging area, Miller's helicopter is attacked by a guerrilla, and several members of the crew are killed. Miller is unable to take out the attacker; instead, the chopper's dying gunner makes the kill, but the co-pilot believes Miller made the crucial shot, earning Miller a false reputation. On the mission, Beckett insists on deviating from the plan that Miller was given. This, together with the fact that Miller has no experience or aptitude for jungle operations, sparks friction between the two. Early on, they encounter a group of Indians, who agree to lead them past the rebel guerrillas, in return for a favour: they must agree to eliminate El Cirujano (\\"The Surgeon\\"), an ex-CIA agent and expert in torture who has been aiding the rebels.

Step 1: Understand Cluedo Cluedo is a classic murder-mystery board game, where the goal is to deduce who committed the murder, with which weapon, and in which room. The game involves a mansion map with different rooms and murder weapon tokens. It features six character tokens (Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlett, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, and Mr. Green). Step 2: Determine the starting character In a standard game of Cluedo, the order of play is usually determined by each player rolling the die. The player with the highest roll goes first, and then play continues clockwise around the table. The character tokens don't have any special order. However, it's worth noting that in some Cluedo versions and rule sets, a specific character is designated to begin the game: Miss Scarlett. This rule may not apply to all Cluedo editions. When Miss Scarlett is set to start the game, play continues clockwise from her position. Conclusion: In a standard game of Cluedo, the starting character is typically determined by the highest die roll. However, in certain editions or rule sets, Miss Scarlett is designated as the character who starts the game."},{"instruction":"Question: when did scars to your beautiful come out??

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

Options: - yes - no","output":"To determine the validity of the claim \\"Slavs have lived in Eastern Europe for centuries,\\" we will first need to examine the historical evidence regarding the Slavic people and their presence in Eastern Europe. Step 1: Define and identify Slavs and Eastern Europe The Slavs are an ethno-linguistic group of people who share a common cultural heritage, ancestry, and history. Eastern Europe is a region that mainly includes countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and others lying to the east of Germany and Austria. Step 2: Analyze historical evidence The first records of Slavic people in Eastern Europe date back to the 6th century AD, according to historical texts such as the writings of the Byzantine historian Procopius, who mentioned that Slavs inhabited areas of modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia during that time. Additionally, the creation of the Great Moravian Empire in the 9th century and the subsequent rise of the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian states in the centuries that followed resulted from Slavic settlement and state formation processes. Step 3: Assess the validity of the claim Since the historical evidence demonstrates that Slavic people have been present in Eastern Europe since at least the 6th century and had continued cultural, political, and social development in the region over the centuries, the claim is supported by the available evidence. Answer: Thus, the claim \\"Slavs have lived in Eastern Europe for centuries\\" is true, as historical records and the continued presence of Slavic people in the region support this statement.

The answer could be that Sanskrit influenced Sino-Tibetan languages through the spread of translated Buddhist texts. An example supporting this could be the borrowing of words like 'kṣaṇa', which found its way into the Chinese vocabulary as 'chànà'. 2. Who sent the Mahayana missionaries to China and why? The student should be able to state that the passage mentions King Ashoka as the motivator behind this move with the objective of spreading Buddhism. 3. What is significant about Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit according to the passage? The student will note from the passage that Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit was primarily used for the translation of texts which were disseminated by Mahayana missionaries, thus playing a pivotal role in spreading Buddhism. 4. Explain how the Sanskrit language influenced certain Chinese words. This answer should reference the part of the passage that talks about how many terms were transliterated directly from Sanskrit and added to the Chinese vocabulary. An example of this is the word 'chànà', derived directly from the Sanskrit word ‘kṣaṇa’. 5. Where do many Sanskrit texts survive today and in what form? The student should specify that many of these texts survive in Tibetan collections as commentaries to the Buddhist teachings called the Tengyur.

Since A, B, C, and D have invested in the ratio of 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and the rest, we can find the share of each partner in the profit by using their investment ratios. First, let's determine the combined investment of A, B, and C to find out D's investment ratio.

Question: suppose \\"a person doesnt have access to clean water\\" happens, how will it affect \\"the body isnt being hydrated\\". How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When a person doesn't have access to clean water, their body will be less hydrated. This situation will have a significant effect on the overall physiological and metabolic processes of the body. The lack of proper hydration will lead to a chain of events affecting various functions of the body, including the pancreas and digestion. The pancreas plays a crucial role in digestion, breaking down carbohydrates and aiding in the digestion of other foods and liquids. In a body that isn't being hydrated, the normal functioning of the pancreas may be compromised. Dehydration can cause the pancreas to produce less digestive enzymes, leading to improper breakdown of carbohydrates and other nutrients, ultimately affecting the absorption of nutrients in the body. Additionally, dehydration can slow down the passage of food through the gastrointestinal tract, leading to constipation and further affecting the absorption of nutrients. Since water is a vital component in the blood, dehydration will also impact the volume and circulation of blood, compromising the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the body's cells and tissues. In summary, if a person doesn't have access to clean water and the body isn't being hydrated, it will have a significant negative effect on the normal functioning of the pancreas and overall digestion.

Instead of needle-like leaves, aspen trees have rounded, flat, and thin leaves with serrated edges. The leaves of an aspen tree grow symmetrically and are usually 1.5 to 3 inches long. A unique feature of aspen leaves is their flattened petioles, which cause them to tremble or quiver in the wind, hence the names such as \\"quaking\\" or \\"trembling\\" aspens.

The fulcrum is an essential component of a lever system, which is the basic principle behind the operation of a crane. A lever is a simple machine that is used for moving heavy objects by applying a small amount of force over a greater distance. A crane consists of several components, including a beam (also known as the arm or boom), a fulcrum, a counterweight, and a lifting mechanism. The beam is the long horizontal or diagonal element that extends from the base of the crane, while the lifting mechanism is a winch or hoist system that is used to lift and lower heavy loads. The fulcrum is the pivot point of the crane's beam, which is usually situated close to its base. It acts as the center of rotation and provides support for the lever system, enabling the crane to perform its lifting and lowering tasks efficiently. A key factor in the efficiency of a lever system is the distribution of weight on either side of the fulcrum. In the case of a crane, the counterweight is the heavy mass located on the opposite side of the fulcrum from the lifting mechanism. It helps to balance the load and the beam, providing stability and reducing the amount of force needed to lift the load. When the load is to be lifted, the lifting mechanism applies a force to one end of the beam, while the counterweight balances the crane on the other end. As the crane's beam pivots around the fulcrum, the distance over which the lifting force is applied increases, which in turn provides more lifting power. This multiplication of force allows a crane to move heavy objects with relative ease, given that an appropriate counterweight is in place to maintain stability. In conclusion, a crane requires a fulcrum to operate properly, as it serves as the pivot point and support for the lever system that enables the crane to efficiently lift heavy loads. Other factors, such as an adequate counterweight and a well-designed lifting mechanism, also contribute to the successful operation of a crane."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? Answer:","output":"It seems that you might be referring to a particular scenario involving someone named Kendall who addressed the flaws in some light-related context and came up with a solution. Without more specific information about the situation, it is difficult to provide an accurate response. However, I can still offer a general perspective on how others might feel as a result of Kendall's actions. If Kendall genuinely identified flaws in a light-related system, design, or concept and effectively provided a solution to fix those issues, then others might feel a variety of emotions as a result: 1. Appreciation: People who were affected by the flaws or those who found them annoying may appreciate Kendall's effort to acknowledge the issue and work towards resolving it. They would likely be grateful for the improvement in their experience or environment. 2. Respect: Some individuals may respect Kendall's skills, dedication, and problem-solving abilities, as solving a problem often requires critical thinking and expertise in a particular area. 3. Inspiration: Observers or teammates might feel inspired by Kendall's actions to address problems proactively and create positive changes when they encounter similar situations in the future. 4. Relief: In some cases, issues with lighting (e.g., flickering, poor color rendering, inadequate brightness) can cause discomfort, inconvenience, or even health issues. If Kendall's solution successfully addressed these concerns, people who were affected may feel relieved. 5. Skepticism or resistance: There might also be individuals who question the necessity or value of the changes Kendall implemented. They may be skeptical about the effectiveness of the solution or worry about potential implications (e.g., costs, adaptability) on a larger scale. It is essential to note that these emotions may vary depending on the context, the nature of the flaws, the proposed solution, and the way Kendall presents their findings and ideas. In real-life scenarios, people's feelings and reactions can be quite diverse and complex, and it's crucial to consider everyone's unique perspective when introducing changes or improvements."},{"instruction":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Perhaps the best Isabel Allende's book, House of the Spirits describes an alternative chilean history, this one full of magic, a mystic veil, plus some kind of omnipresent sadness.

In order to cancel out the term on the right side, we should add 669j to both sides of the equation: -2225j + 669j - 53499 = -669j + 669j + 22745 This simplifies to: -1556j - 53499 = 22745 Now, we want to move the constant term (-53499) to the right side of the equation. To do this, we should add 53499 to both sides of the equation: -1556j - 53499 + 53499 = 22745 + 53499 This simplifies to: -1556j = 76244 Step 3: Solve for j Now that j is isolated on one side of the equation, we can solve for it by dividing both sides by the coefficient of j (-1556): -1556j / -1556 = 76244 / -1556 This simplifies to: j = -49 So, the solution to the given equation is j = -49."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

Make a pregnancy plan.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Creating a Pregnancy Plan: Family History, Risk Factors, and More Introduction Planning for a pregnancy is a significant decision that requires thorough preparation and knowledge. It involves not only the excitement of bringing a new life into the world but also understanding the risks and challenges that come with it. One of the crucial steps in preparing for a pregnancy is to get a family history, determine other risk factors, and create a pregnancy plan. In this article, we'll guide you through these steps to help you be better prepared and feel confident in your journey to parenthood. 1. Get a Family History Understanding your family history is a key component in assessing the risks your future child may face. It helps you identify possible genetic conditions, and provides insight into the overall health of both parents. Step One: Gather Information Talk to your family members, especially your parents, grandparents, and siblings, about any medical conditions or hereditary diseases that run in the family. Take note of any conditions that affected multiple family members or were severe. Step Two: Consult with a Genetic Counselor Armed with the information you've gathered, a genetic counselor can help determine your risk of passing on these conditions to your future child. They can also provide advice on possible prenatal testing and ways to reduce risks. 2. Determine Other Risk Factors Apart from your family history, there are other factors that can influence the health of your pregnancy. These include your age, lifestyle, and pre-existing medical conditions. Step One: Assess Personal Risk Factors Women who are younger than 18 or older than 35 may experience increased risks during pregnancy. Some lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and poor diet can also have an impact. Similarly, pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, can complicate things further. Step Two: Address Modifiable Risk Factors Modifiable risk factors, such as lifestyle choices, should be addressed to minimize their impact on pregnancy. For example, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and improving your diet can help create a healthier environment for your future child. Step Three: Regular Check-ups Schedule regular medical check-ups to monitor your health and any pre-existing conditions. This way, you can work with your healthcare provider to manage your health before and during pregnancy. 3. Make a Pregnancy Plan Creating a pregnancy plan involves considering the practical aspects of your pregnancy journey. Step One: Choose a Healthcare Provider Find a healthcare provider that you trust and feel comfortable with, as they will play a significant role throughout your pregnancy. Make sure to discuss your family history and risk factors with them. Step Two: Create a Financial Plan Assess your financial situation, and plan for the additional expenses that come with pregnancy and raising a child. This may involve budgeting, adjusting your insurance, or even changing your living situation. Step Three: Plan for Maternity and Paternity Leave Discuss maternity and paternity leave options with your employer. Make sure you understand your rights and responsibilities, and how your leave will be structured. Conclusion By getting a family history, determining your risk factors, and creating a pregnancy plan, you are taking proactive steps to ensure a healthier pregnancy and a smoother transition into parenthood. A well-planned journey to parenthood can help minimize risks, reduce stress, and promote the well-being of your future child.

Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks \\"Do you agree?\\" the other person might think, \\"No, I disagree. I think you're wrong...\\" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say \\"I'm not sure.\\" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says \\"I've to go now.\\" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse \\"Someone's at the door.\\" \\"Something is burning on the stove.\\" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language. Question: When a person disagree with someone, it is polite to say \\" _ \\".

Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \\"flashing\\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \\"graphitized\\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage. What is the answer to this question: What material were the first light bulb filaments made from?","output":"The first successful light bulb filaments were made from carbon. These carbon filaments were derived from carbonized paper or bamboo.

After her reign, Egypt became a province of the recently established Roman Empire. - Raetia (or , , also spelled Rhaetia) was a province of the Roman Empire, named after the Rhaetian (\\"Raeti\\" or \\"Rhaeti\\") people. It bordered on the west with the country of the Helvetii, on the east with Noricum, on the north with Vindelicia, on the west with Transalpine Gaul and on south with Venetia et Histria. It thus comprised the districts occupied in modern times by eastern and central Switzerland (containing the Upper Rhine and Lake Constance), southern Bavaria and the Upper Swabia, Vorarlberg, the greater part of Tirol, and part of Lombardy. Later Vindelicia (today south-eastern Wuerttemberg and south-western Bavaria) formed part of Raetia. The northern border of Raetia during the times of Augustus and Tiberius was the River Danube. Later the Limes Germanicus marked the northern boundary, stretching for 166 km north of the Danube. Raetia linked to Italy across the Alps over the Reschen Pass, by the Via Claudia Augusta. The Romansh people living in Southeast Switzerland are believed to be direct descendants of the Raetians. However, the exact lineage of the Romansh (or Romansch) people remains incomplete. - Magnus Maximus (ca. 335 August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Aquileia ( Venetian: Aquieja/Aquiegia, ) is an ancient Roman city in Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in Antiquity as one of the world's largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the 2nd century AD. and is one of the main archeological sites of Northern Italy. - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Theodosius I (11 January 347 17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. - Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I.

The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander . According to this account Marcomer , Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania and Belgia in Gaul . They broke through the lines , killed many people , destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city Cologne panic . After this raid , the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty . Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods . When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus , Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier , they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of them . After this engagement Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country , however his army was surrounded and beaten . Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes , others were killed by Franks , few made it back to their Empire . Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus , who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks . Later , after the fall of Magnus Maximus , Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes , who was a general ( magister militum ) in the Roman army . The Franks delivered hostages as usual , and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier . A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries , he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania , because he hated his own kin . Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage . Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany . His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to... - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone.

At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - White Pony is the third studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on June 20, 2000 by Maverick Records. It marked a significant growth in the band's sound and is considered a turning point for the band in terms of experimentation, employing an increasingly experimental rock sound and incorporating more new wave, dream pop, trip hop, shoegaze and post-rock influences into the alternative metal sound for which the group had become known. Upon release and retrospectively, the album was met with overall critical acclaim and is generally regarded by fans and critics alike as one of their most mature outings, despite being one of the group's last albums to be described by some critics as part of the contentious nu metal genre. \\"White Pony\\" is also their highest-selling album to date.

When suffering a mid-life crisis, most men consider buying a sports car or signing up for the gym. But married IT consultant Ian Penfold, 50, decided instead to act out his life long dream - headlining his own rock concert. The father-of-two, from Wokingham in Berkshire, spent £26,000 on the gig at the Hammersmith Apollo so he could perform in front of 2,000 friends with his band, Hidden Agenda, to mark his 50th birthday. Scroll down to see video. Star: The father-of-two spent £26,000 renting out the venue and setting it up for the gig for his 50th birthday. The goal was to follow in the. footsteps of global names who have played there before, such as Bob. Dylan, Eric Clapton, Iron Maiden and Blondie. However,. it was a daunting task for Mr Penfold, who, with his disco tribute act,. normally plays in front of a feeble crowd of around 100 people. He spent two years planning and organising the event and faced the prospect of a huge financial loss if his dream failed. It. costs £12,000 to hire the venue and, on top of this, Mr Penfold and. Hidden Agenda would have to pay for all of the lighting, sound and cost. of publicising the event. This. came to more than £26,000. Despite never having done anything like this. before, the band managed to sell more than 1,600 tickets at £18 each. before giving around 400 to charities to give away.

Mr Penfold, from Wokingham, Berkshire, played bass guitar at the gig, which took place last weekend. He said: 'My 50th birthday was on the horizon and I wanted to do something special, and slightly silly. 'So in May 2012 I approached the Apollo and they were super helpful. 'I asked the manager if anyone had done this before and he just gave me a look, but I saw this as a challenge and it spurred me on. Preparation: Mr Penfold, who lives in Wokingham, Berkshire, spent two years planning the concert. 'When you hire out the Apollo, you. simply get an empty room. You have to sort out the sound, the lighting,. the tickets and promotion. It took over mine and my wife Janet’s lives. 'I. didn’t have £26,000 to lose so it was a big risk but we took a leap of. faith and managed to break even which was a real achievement.' Rock That - Earth Wind & Fire. Le Freak - Chic.

After the warm-up acts, Me Penfold and the rest of Hidden Agenda went out onto stage to perform in front of the 2,000 spectators. Miffy Scally and Alana Warner were the singers, Angela Neil was on sax, Patrick Moore on guitar, Rob Hodgkinson on keyboards, Colin Bibby on drums and Ian on bass. They opened up with ‘Rock That’, by Earth, Wind and Fire and played classics like ‘Car Wash’ by Rose Royce and ‘Superstition’ by Stevie Wonder. The gig finished with a standing ovation as the group thrashed out ‘Hot Stuff’ by Donna Summer. He added: 'It was very enjoyable and more relaxing than expected. It all came along and there were more than 2,000 people watch. 'Seeing my name in lights outside was really special. Strangely, when it got to the performance I was really relaxed about it. 'There was a huge build-up but it ended up going really well. Everyone was up on their feet dancing.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Genetic and environmental variation are both known to influence development. Evolution of a developmental response that is optimized to the environment (adaptive plasticity) requires the existence of genetic variation for that developmental response. In complex traits composed of integrated sets of subsidiary traits, the adaptive process may be slowed by the existence of multiple possible integrated responses. This study tests for family (sibship) specific differences in plastic response to hypoxia in an integrated set of cardiovascular traits in zebrafish.', 'Cardiac output, which is the integrated product of several subsidiary traits, varied highly significantly between families, and families differed significantly in the degree and direction of response to developmental oxygen level. The cardiac output response to oxygen environment was entirely family specific with no significant overall trend due to oxygen level. Constituent physiological variables that contribute to cardiac output all showed significant family specific response to hypoxia. Traits that were not directly related to cardiac output, such as arterial and venous diameter, and red blood cell velocities did not respond to hypoxia in a family specific manner.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf. I told him that I appreciated the call, but he wasn’t the one who needed to apologize.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Something sugared"},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: To put a measured amount of liquid soap into a spray bottle. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Step 1: Gather materials To accomplish this task, I would first gather the following materials: - A spray bottle (with a capacity large enough to hold the desired amount of liquid soap) - Liquid soap - A measuring cup or container (with volume markings) - A funnel (optional, but recommended for easier pouring) Step 2: Determine the desired amount of liquid soap I would obtain the information on the desired amount of liquid soap needed to be put into the spray bottle. This can be based on personal preference or any specific instructions. Step 3: Measure the liquid soap Using the measuring cup or container, I would carefully measure the desired amount of liquid soap. It's important to ensure an accurate measurement, so the level of soap should match the volume marking on the measuring container. Step 4: Prepare the spray bottle Before adding the liquid soap, I would make sure that the spray bottle is clean, empty, and dry. If necessary, I would rinse it with water and allow it to fully dry. Step 5: Transfer the liquid soap to the spray bottle Using the funnel (if available), I would place it in the opening of the spray bottle to avoid spillage. Carefully, I would pour the measured liquid soap from the measuring container into the spray bottle. If a funnel is not available, pouring slowly and steadily directly from the measuring container can work, but there's a higher risk of spillage. Step 6: Secure the spray nozzle After pouring the required amount of liquid soap into the spray bottle, I would correctly secure the spray nozzle onto the bottle. Step 7: Test the spray bottle Lastly, I would test the spray bottle by giving it a few pumps to ensure that it's functioning properly and the liquid soap solution is being dispersed at the desired pressure. By following these steps, the goal of putting a measured amount of liquid soap into a spray bottle would be successfully accomplished."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence.The American news anchor who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel’s coverage of President Putin sending troops into Ukraine was the final straw for her.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"To determine if Jack Dempsey had the most title fight wins in either of his weight classes, let's first identify the weight classes he competed in and then compare his record to other notable fighters in those classes. Jack Dempsey, born William Harrison Dempsey, was an American professional boxer who competed mostly in the heavyweight division. He held the title of World Heavyweight Champion from 1919 to 1926. He also competed in a few fights in the light heavyweight division earlier in his career but rose to prominence in the heavyweight division. In the heavyweight division, Jack Dempsey had a total of 6 title fight wins. He won the title against Jess Willard in 1919 and successfully defended it against Billy Miske, Bill Brennan, Georges Carpentier, Tommy Gibbons, and Luis Firpo before losing to Gene Tunney in 1926. It's important to recognize that there have been many heavyweight champions throughout history, so we must compare Dempsey's record to other notable champions. Muhammad Ali, for instance, had a total of 22 heavyweight title fight wins, which includes both winning and defending the title. Joe Louis, another legendary heavyweight, held the title from 1937 to 1949 and had 25 successful title defenses. Based on this comparison, Jack Dempsey did not have the most title fight wins in the heavyweight division. Considering his brief time in the light heavyweight division and the fact that he never won a title in that category, it is clear that Dempsey did not have the most title fight wins in either of his weight classes."},{"instruction":"Question: what are some countries?

It involved the majority of the world's nations, including all the great powers, which eventually formed two opposing alliances: the Allies, led by the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom; and the Axis, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is estimated that between 70 million and 85 million people, both military and civilian, perished during the conflict. This constitutes about 3% to 4% of the world's population at that time, which was approximately 2.3 billion people. Breaking down the numbers further, total military deaths are estimated to be around 15 million to 25 million, including battle-related deaths, missing in action, and non-battle-related deaths as a result of the war. Civilian deaths, on the other hand, range from 38 million to 55 million. This massive loss of life includes deaths from war-related disease and famine, Holocaust victims, and casualties resulting from strategic bombing, among other causes. It is critical to emphasize that these are only estimates, as the complete and accurate data is challenging to gather due to the chaotic nature of the conflict, and record keeping was not always consistent. Moreover, numbers can vary depending on the source or historian, but the consensus remains that World War II was one of the deadliest conflicts in human history, with a significant percentage of the global population perishing as a direct or indirect outcome of the war."},{"instruction":"They are damaging!

În contrast, relațiile nesănătoase pot implica abuz emoțional, fizic sau sexual, ceea ce poate avea consecințe grave pentru sănătatea și bunăstarea persoanei afectate. Gândurile și emoțiile negative pot fi, de asemenea, dăunătoare pentru sănătatea noastră mintală și fizică. Stresul, anxietatea, depresia și alte stări emoționale negative pot afecta modul în care corpul și mintea noastră funcționează. Pentru a contracara efectele nocive ale acestor stări, este important să practicăm tehnici de gestionare a stresului, precum relaxarea, meditația și conversația deschisă cu familia și prietenii. În concluzie, este important să fim conștienți de lucrurile dăunătoare care ne înconjoară și să facem tot posibilul pentru a minimiza expunerea și impactul negativ asupra sănătății și vieții noastre. Prin prevenirea și abordarea acestor factori dăunători, putem contribui la crearea unei lumi mai sănătoase, mai sigure și mai fericite."},{"instruction":"See question below: Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on...

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.

Recall knowledge about the Old Testament, focusing on books written by Moses and speeches made to the Israelites. 2. Identify any books centered around speeches given shortly before the Israelites enter the Promised Land. 3. Confirm the answer based on my knowledge and reasoning. Step 1: Recall that the Old Testament has five books that are attributed to Moses, called the Pentateuch. These books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Step 2: Analyze the context of each book and identify if it contains speeches given by Moses before entering the Promised Land: - Genesis: Focuses on the creation, early history of mankind, and the lives of Israel's patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). - Exodus: Narrates the story of the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt, their deliverance, and the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. - Leviticus: Consists primarily of laws and commandments given to the Israelites. It does not involve Moses delivering speeches before entering the Promised Land. - Numbers: Chronicles the Israelites' 40-year journey in the wilderness. While Moses does give speeches, they are not near the entrance to the Promised Land. - Deuteronomy: Centers around Moses delivering a series of speeches to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. He reminds them of their covenant with God, reviews laws, and encourages them to be faithful. Step 3: Based on the information and context of each book, I can confirm that the answer is Deuteronomy. It is the book in the Old Testament that consists of speeches by Moses to the Israelites shortly before they enter the Promised Land."},{"instruction":"Hendrick Motorsports plane crash victims showed evidence of faith PATRICK SPRINGS, Va.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"As an AI, it seems like you are mentioning two different things: one is a funny TV show involving DIY paper-made cars, and the other is a hypothetical scenario about the last few people on earth. Let me analyze these two topics and answer the questions about the second topic. First Topic: DIY Paper-Made Car TV Show There is not enough information for me to determine the exact TV show you are referring to. However, it seems like a fun and entertaining concept, in which people attempt to create paper cars that can fly over water without falling in. Second Topic: The Last Few People on Earth Scenario 1. Water stored in water towers: Water availability would depend on a few factors, such as the water tower's current supply, evaporation rate, and any potential leaks or damage to the system. However, since water towers are designed to hold large volumes of water and supply it to many households, it's likely that a lone person would have access to water supply from the tower for a considerable duration. 2. Power production from a home generator: A home generator's ability to produce power would depend on the type, size, and fuel source of the generator. If the generator runs on a renewable energy source such as solar power, it can continue to operate as long as it remains in good condition. In case of fuel-powered generators, the power availability would largely depend on the fuel reserves the person has access to. Now, coming back to your question: \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" No, these two topics and their respective questions are not the same. The first topic is a light-hearted discussion about an entertaining TV show, while the second topic tackles questions about survival in a hypothetical post-apocalyptic scenario.

List: [59, 957, 73, 599, 523, 163, 331, 127, 751, 103, 977, 358] Step 2: Define a helper function (is_prime) to determine whether a number is prime or not. A prime number is an integer that is only divisible by '1' and itself. Step 3: Implement the is_prime function. - For each number n in the list, check if it is prime. - To check for primality, start with dividing the number by 2. If it's divisible, then the number is not prime. - If the number is not divisible by 2, check for divisibility with odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of the number. If it's divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime. - If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it's prime. Step 4: Remove all non-prime integers from the list. - Loop through the list of integers. - For each integer, call the is_prime helper function and check if it returns True or False. - If the function returns True, it means the number is prime, and we keep it in the list. - If the function returns False, it means the number is not prime, and we remove it from the list.

Therefore, there is partial similarity in the context of who is giving the advice or information, but they are still distinct figures. Step 2: Analyze the actions Both sentences use the same action, \\"told me,\\" which indicates that the speaker received information or advice from the subject in both cases.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer both questions, let me first explain the keywords individually and then compare them. Question 1: \\"What is the use of the 'this' keyword in Java?\\" Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'this' keyword in Java is used as a reference to the current object of a class. It helps to differentiate between instance variables and local variables with the same names within a constructor or method. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java public class MyClass { int variable; public MyClass(int variable) { this.variable = variable; } } \`\`\` In this example, 'this.variable' refers to the instance variable, while 'variable' refers to the local variable passed to the constructor. Question 2: Why use the super keyword in java? Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'super' keyword in Java is used to reference the parent class's methods or variables, especially in cases of overridden methods or constructors. It allows access to the methods or variables of the immediate parent class. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java class Parent { int number; Parent(int number) { this.number = number; } } class Child extends Parent { int number; Child(int number, int childNumber) { super(number); this.number = childNumber; } } \`\`\` In this example, the 'super(number)' in the Child class constructor calls the constructor of the Parent class. Now, let's address if questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Step 3: Compare the keywords. While 'this' refers to the current object of a class, 'super' refers to the parent class's methods or variables. Although both keywords serve to differentiate between variables with the same name, they navigate different relationships in the class hierarchy. Step 4: Provide conclusion. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the usage of the 'this' keyword for current object references, while Question 2 is concerned with the use of the 'super' keyword for parent class references."},{"instruction":"Definition: The given sentence contains a typo which could be one of the following four types: (1) swapped letters of a word e.g. 'niec' is a typo of the word 'nice'.

If the pain persists for two to three menstrual cycles, if it is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, or is growing, you will likely be advised to proceed with surgery to have your ovarian cyst(s) removed. The vast majority of ovarian cysts are benign. Either just the cyst can be removed from the ovary, or the entire ovary can be removed. The extent of the surgery will depend upon the number of cysts present on the ovary, as well as the age of the patient and reproductive considerations. (The surgery is generally more extensive following menopause.) Fortunately, if the entire ovary needs to be removed surgically, there is still the ovary on the other side, so the woman does not need to lose her fertility by having a surgical procedure performed. if there is any suspicion that it may be cancerous. Another key factor in deciding whether or not surgery is needed as a treatment for ovarian cyst(s) is assessing the cyst(s) for the possibility that they may one day become cancerous. If there is the risk of them developing into a cancer, your doctor will advise that surgery be performed to prevent this from occurring. When an ovarian cyst(s) is removed due to the possibility of it becoming cancerous, it is advised to have the fallopian tubes and uterus removed in addition to both ovaries. This, of course, has reproductive implications that need to be discussed with your doctor, because having all of these structures removed will make you infertile. If your ovarian cyst(s) is not yet showing signs of persistent pain and/or a risk for cancer, your doctor will likely advise that you try the approach of \\"watchful waiting.\\" This consists of using pain medications as needed to relieve your ovarian cyst pain, while hoping that the cyst ultimately resolves itself without the need for medical intervention. You must, however, commit to thorough follow-up with serial ultrasounds. This will ensure the cysts don't get worse. If the cysts do not improve with time, surgery may be advised. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the treatment options for ovarian cyst pain, emphasizing that short-term pain can be managed with medication, but if the pain persists or the cyst has potential to become cancerous, surgery may be necessary. The extent of surgery depends on various factors, such as the patient's age and reproductive considerations. The article also highlights the importance of watchful waiting with regular follow-ups and ultrasounds before resorting to surgery, as cysts might resolve themselves without medical intervention."},{"instruction":"Review: As a kid, I loved computer animation although it was EXTREMELY limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, as I sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer. This is a whole-package deal, between the music and the video, that really packs a one-two punch. If you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE. I still, almost 20 years later, rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. The originality, I think, is still unsurpassed by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits out. I am currently wanting to see if I can re-make it on my own; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a TON of imitation =) What is the sentiment of this review?

Step 1: Research album sales I will search for the latest, reliable data on the total number of Kanye West's and Taylor Swift's album sales on reputable sources, such as industry reports, certified sales databases, and music charts. Step 2: Compare their sales figures Once the data is gathered, I will compare the total albums sales of Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Step 3: Determination and justification I will identify who has sold more albums between Kanye West and Taylor Swift based on the information gathered, and provide a brief justification explaining the result. After researching the latest available data, as of October 2021, the total certified album sales from RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) are as follows: Kanye West: - Total U.S. certified albums sales: 21.5 million - Since these are US numbers, international sales would have to be estimated. It is difficult to find an exact figure, but a reasonable estimation would be around 35 to 40 million albums sold worldwide. Taylor Swift: - Total U.S. certified albums sales: 46 million - Taylor Swift's international sales, estimated to be around 50 million plus, making her total sales approximately 96 million albums. Based on these numbers, Taylor Swift has sold more albums than Kanye West. The main reason for this difference might be Taylor Swift's vast appeal to a wider audience and consistency in releasing successful albums throughout her career."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Blue Spice eatType coffee shop; Blue Spice priceRange moderate; Blue Spice customer rating 3 out of 5; Blue Spice area riverside; Blue Spice near Avalon.

Jeffrey didn't have to buy clothes for the ski trip but Nelson did because","output":"Nelson realized that all his winter gear was either worn out or outdated, and he certainly didn't want to compromise his comfort and safety during the exhilarating ski experience that lay ahead. As he sifted through his closet, he discovered that his trusty ski jacket had lost a significant amount of insulation, leading to a reduced capacity to retain warmth. His gloves, with years of use, had frayed seams which would allow the cold air to seep in and make his hands numb and stiff. To top it all, Nelson couldn't seem to locate matching socks that would offer adequate cushioning and wick away moisture, so as to prevent discomfort and blisters while he enjoyed the snowy mountain slopes. Knowing the importance of having suitable, high-quality gear for an upcoming ski trip, Nelson decided to invest in new clothing that would provide him with the desired protection and support. He ventured out into the city in search of a reputable retailer that could meet his unique requirements and also impart suggestions based on his personal preferences. Upon arriving at the store, Nelson was greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member who offered assistance in finding the perfect attire for his upcoming adventure. He was presented with a diverse array of options, ranging from insulated jackets and high-performance thermal layers to breathable yet warm gloves, merino wool socks, and even durable, waterproof pants that would allow him to stay dry while traversing the powdery snow. As Nelson browsed through the vast selection, he kept in mind his need for clothing that would not only insulate him effectively from the cold but also regulate his body temperature as he engaged in rigorous physical activities. He tried on a few different combinations of base layers, midlayers, and outerwear until he found the perfect balance of warmth, flexibility, and moisture-wicking properties that would ensure optimal performance on the slopes. While selecting a pair of gloves, Nelson paid special attention to the construction and materials, ultimately choosing a pair that featured touchscreen compatibility and a reinforced grip for enhanced dexterity. He knew that these features would enable him to conveniently use his smartphone, adjusting settings on his action camera, and firmly grasp his ski poles as he navigated the mountain terrain. Similarly, when it came to choosing socks, he opted for a pair with targeted cushioning and seamless construction to mitigate any potential chafing or irritation that could arise during a long day out in the snow. Once he had carefully evaluated and hand-picked each garment, Nelson confidently made his purchase, eager to put his new gear to the test during the upcoming ski trip. He was grateful for the assistance he had received in selecting the most suitable clothing and felt reassured that his commitment to prioritizing quality and functionality would significantly enhance his overall experience on the mountains. As the ski trip neared, Jeffrey marveled at his good fortune for already possessing suitable attire for the adventure, while Nelson eagerly anticipated the opportunity to break in his newly acquired gear. Both friends looked forward to the thrilling escapades that awaited them, each fully equipped and ready to face the challenging slopes with zeal and confidence."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What should I do if I suspect that my boss is having an affair with someone in the office?

Question 2: Has anyone ever used vita pulse? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To address these questions, I will first provide answers to each question individually and then determine if they are asking the same thing. Question 1: Why should the sleeping pulse be recorded in hyperthyroidism? Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the importance of recording the sleeping pulse in cases of hyperthyroidism. Step 2: Gather relevant information Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormone, which can lead to various symptoms, including a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Step 3: Analyze the information The sleeping pulse, or resting heart rate, can serve as an indicator of a person's overall health and fitness. In cases of hyperthyroidism, an elevated resting heart rate can be a sign that the body is producing too much thyroid hormone. Step 4: Respond to the question The sleeping pulse should be recorded in hyperthyroidism because it can help reveal if a person's heart rate is abnormally elevated due to the overproduction of thyroid hormone. Monitoring the resting heart rate can assist in diagnosing and managing the condition. Question 2: Has anyone ever used vita pulse? Step 1: Understand the question The question asks if anyone has ever used a product called \\"Vita Pulse.\\" Step 2: Gather relevant information Vita Pulse is a dietary supplement that claims to support heart health and overall well-being by providing antioxidants and other nutrients. Step 3: Analyze the information As Vita Pulse is a dietary supplement available in the market, it's likely that some people have tried it. Step 4: Respond to the question Yes, people have used Vita Pulse, as it is a dietary supplement available for purchase. Comparison: Now, I'll determine if questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Step 1: Identify the subjects of each question - Question 1 pertains to recording sleeping pulse in hyperthyroidism - Question 2 refers to the usage of a dietary supplement called Vita Pulse Step 2: Compare the subjects and purpose of each question - The first question is about the importance of monitoring heart rate in a specific medical condition (hyperthyroidism) - The second question is about the usage of a particular dietary supplement Step 3: Draw a conclusion Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, as they concern different subjects - one is related to a medical condition (hyperthyroidism) and its monitoring, while the other is about a dietary supplement and its usage."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Miss Universe Puerto Rico stripped of crown for her 'attitude' files 3M lawsuit SAN JUAN (AP) – A beauty queen who was dethroned as Puerto Rico's representative at this year's Miss Universe contest after organizers accused her of having an attitude problem is taking her fight to court. Kristhielee Caride filed a 3 million lawsuit Thursday in which she demands the return of her crown and the multiple gifts she won, including a car, plastic surgery and a seven-day cruise. She was stripped of her title nearly a month ago. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and contractual damages. It was filed against PR Crown Entertainment and officials including Desiree Lowry, national director of Miss Universe Puerto Rico. Lowry's attorney, former Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Antonio Sagardia, told The Associated Press that he declined to meet with Caride's attorneys at their request. \\"There's nothing to talk about,\\" he said. \\"Our decision is final.\\" Caride's attorney, Ernie Caban, did not return a call for comment. Caride was stripped of her title after she was criticized for being dismissive and saying she did not love cameras in an interview with a local newspaper. \\"That's like an athlete saying, 'I don't like to train,'\\" Sagardia said. Lowry told reporters at the time that Caride never apologized and said only that she was having personal issues and that such an incident would not happen again. However, Lowry said Caride then canceled other appearances because of a doctor's appointment she refused to reschedule. The lawsuit says Caride underwent an unspecified surgical intervention in late February and needed to rest for a month. It said she then made a required public appearance and did not wear unspecified, required post-operation accessories on Lowry's orders. The lawsuit also states that a friend of Caride's suffered a hemorrhage during that time and it affected her emotional state. The lawsuit says Caride was briefly hospitalized for depression after she was stripped of her title. Caride said in a Facebook post last month that beauty queens are not exempt from bad days and that she allowed her feelings to come before her job. She apologized and said she was turning over her sash even though she disagreed with the decision.

She is a member of the Penobscot Nation, which is an indigenous tribe in the United States. Step 2: Research First Nations band governments First Nations band governments are a form of indigenous self-government in Canada. They provide an organizational structure for indigenous communities in Canada to manage their affairs according to their traditions and cultures. Step 3: Compare Sherri Mitchell's tribe with First Nations bands Given that Sherri Mitchell is a member of the Penobscot Nation, and the Penobscot Nation is located in the United States, it is not organized as a First Nations band government, as these are specific to Canada.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Who is the most concerned about the father's health? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Ann - The narrator - Glenn Miller - not enough information A:","output":"The most concerned about the father's health appears to be the narrator. Although not explicitly stated, there are several clues within the passage that suggest this conclusion. First, the passage describes the father's warning signal that the narrator had learned to recognize as a child – the lower lid of his left eye creeping up – which implies a long history of paying attention to his father's emotions and well-being. This attention to detail indicates a level of concern the narrator has for his father. Second, the passage mentions that the narrator's older sister Ann glared at him, blaming him for \\"winding him up.\\" This suggests that the narrator is aware of his father's emotional triggers and the importance of not upsetting him. This knowledge and the fact that the sister is blaming the narrator for causing potential distress in their father show that there is a general concern among the family members for the father's health. However, this passage does not explicitly state that Ann is the most concerned. Lastly, Glenn Miller is certainly not the most concerned about the father's health, as he is a musician being discussed, not a character involved in the story. There is also not enough information about other potential concerned individuals, apart from the narrator and Ann, to determine the most concerned person. From the given information, we can infer that the narrator is the most concerned about the father's health."},{"instruction":"What happens next?

Step 1: Create the two characters and their backgrounds. Character 1: Alicia - Works for a software company and has benefited from working remotely since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Character 2: Ben - A friend of Alicia who's been working at an office and skeptical about the feasibility of working from home.

Step 3: Develop the main points of the conversation and allow the characters to express their opinions organically. Here is the dialog: Alicia: I've got to say, Ben, working from home has been a game-changer for me. I have so much more flexibility and a better work-life balance now. Ben: Really? I've always wondered how people manage to stay productive while working from home. I mean, don't you get easily distracted? Alicia: I thought I would struggle too, but actually, I've found that I'm more focused on my tasks when I have some control over my environment. I can take short breaks whenever I need to and then get right back to work. Ben: Interesting. But don't you miss the social interaction with your colleagues? I think I would feel pretty isolated working from home all the time. Alicia: That's a fair point. At first, I did miss the office banter and having lunch with my co-workers. But we've adapted by setting up virtual coffee breaks and team-building activities. Plus, I spend more time with my family and can even squeeze in some exercise during my lunch breaks. Ben: Hmm, I have to admit, those things sound pretty tempting. But isn't working from home only feasible for certain job profiles? What about jobs that require teamwork or access to specialized equipment? Alicia: You're right, not all jobs can be done remotely. But for many, it's surprisingly seamless. Collaborative tools like video conferencing and file-sharing have made teamwork very much possible even when you're working from home. Ben: I guess I hadn't considered how technology has made the transition easier. I wonder if my workplace could benefit from a work-from-home policy as well.

There are several reasons to support this conclusion. First, the text explicitly states that \\"The City Club of Portland is a nonprofit [...] civic organization.\\" Nonprofit organizations operate primarily to fulfill a mission or purpose, rather than generating profit for owners or stakeholders. Nonprofits can, and often do, generate revenue from various sources, but any surplus funds are typically reinvested in the organization to further its mission, rather than being distributed to owners or shareholders. As a nonprofit, the City Club of Portland is aligned with this model and does not have the primary goal of making a profit. Secondly, the City Club of Portland is described as a \\"nonpartisan civic organization.\\" Nonpartisan organizations are those that do not support or oppose any political party or candidate and strive to facilitate civic engagement, dialogue, and debate while remaining politically neutral. As such, the organization's primary focus is on promoting thoughtful discussion and informed decision-making among its members and the broader community, rather than pursuing profit-driven objectives. Lastly, the paragraph mentions that Julia Meier is the current Executive Director of the City Club of Portland. As the leader of a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization, Meier's role would typically involve overseeing the day-to-day operations of the organization, setting its strategic direction, and ensuring that it remains true to its mission and vision. While Meier may be responsible for the financial sustainability and overall success of the organization, that success would be measured in terms of how well the City Club of Portland achieves its intended outcomes (e.g., fostering civic engagement and discussion) rather than profit generation. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is accurate to say that the City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit.

Believing that he has been cheated, Joe reclaims his payments but is arrested for robbery. Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. Desperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears. Some time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life. Hearing footsteps, Joe flees from the police who have followed Laura, and Laura is arrested and jailed as an accomplice., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to your friend's question, \\"What business does the man who drove the getaway car for a bank robbery steal from next?\\" in the context of the article, is that after driving the getaway car for a bank robbery, Joe, the taxi driver, is initially sent to a boarding house in Sacramento by Patian to wait for his share of the robbery take. However, he does not commit any other robbery at this point. Instead, he plans to rob a Sacramento flower shop's cash register to get bus fare to return to San Diego in order to get his money from Patian. Yet, he does not follow through with robbing the flower shop, as he meets Laura Benson, falls in love, and decides to go straight. Joe then establishes a new life in Amesville, where he buys a garage using winnings from a crap game. It is only later when Joe returns to San Diego, interacts with Patian again, and is forced by Patian's thugs to commit his next known robbery - this time, robbing a post office. In summary, after driving the getaway car for the bank robbery, Joe initially plans to rob a flower shop's cash register but does not go through with it. His next actual robbery is the post office, orchestrated and coerced by Patian's thugs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Aubrey had skipped breakfast that morning before work.

While no cohesive plot is apparent from the vignette style of the trailer, it can be pieced together that Batman has been murdered, and his killer remains at large. Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two.

Article: Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more sulfur oxides are formed, it may not necessarily lead to less sulfur trioxide formation. However, the effects of these changes on the overall atmospheric chemistry and acid rain formation need to be evaluated. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. More sulfur oxides are formed: This occurs when the coal-burning process intensifies, or when coal with higher sulfur content is used. An increased level of sulfur oxides (SOx, mainly SO2 and SO3) in the atmosphere hints towards an elevated emission of pollutants and potential increase in environmental impacts. 2. Less sulfur trioxide forms: The conversion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to sulfur trioxide (SO3) is not a direct process, but rather, it involves several factors like temperature, the availability of oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (OH), and the presence of catalysts (e.g., metal ions, particulate matter). A reduced formation of sulfur trioxide could signify a decrease in the efficiency of the reaction where SO2 is oxidized to SO3. Now, let's analyze the perturbation's influence on the second effect mentioned - the formation of sulfuric acid and acidic rain: If more sulfur oxides are formed but less sulfur trioxide is produced, the availability of sulfur trioxide to react with water vapor in the atmosphere and form sulfuric acid would be lower. As a result, there would be a decrease in the concentration of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and a consequent reduction in the acidity of the rain. Keep in mind that even if the levels of sulfur trioxide decrease, it may not entirely eliminate the formation of acid rain, as other factors also contribute to acidity, such as nitrogen oxide emissions. However, a reduction in sulfur trioxide could potentially lessen the severity of acid rain. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more sulfur oxides being formed, while less sulfur trioxide is produced, would lead to a reduced effect on the formation of sulfuric acid and acidic rain. However, it is important to consider other factors, pollutants, and chemical interactions in the atmosphere for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact on acid rain formation."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: \\"In principle, we may agree with the decision to entrust one of the secret services to the opposition.

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death.

BoBo had the softest fur you can imagine and the biggest, brightest eyes you've ever seen. He loved to hop around the forest, playing with his friends and exploring new places. One sunny morning, BoBo decided to go on a big adventure to find the shiniest, most colorful rainbow in the sky. He had heard from his fellow animal friends that at the end of this magical rainbow, there was a treasure waiting to be found. BoBo was very excited and couldn't wait to start his journey. Before setting out, BoBo asked his wise old owl friend, Mr. Hoot, for some advice. Mr. Hoot told BoBo to follow the pretty butterflies as they knew the way to the rainbow. So, BoBo began his journey by hopping from one place to another, following the beautiful butterflies that danced and fluttered in the sky. As BoBo hopped along, he met other animals who wanted to join his adventure. A friendly squirrel named Chippy and a curious little hedgehog named Spiky decided to join BoBo on his quest to find the rainbow treasure. Together, they laughed and played as they followed the butterflies deeper into the forest. Soon, they came across a sparkling river with crystal clear water. BoBo, Chippy, and Spiky were puzzled about how to cross the river. Suddenly, they saw a family of turtles swimming by. They asked the turtles if they could help, and the kind-hearted turtles agreed to carry them across the river on their backs. With the help of the turtles, BoBo and his friends continued their journey through the forest. As they walked, they stumbled upon a big, red mushroom that seemed perfect for taking a rest. Just as they sat down, they heard giggles coming from inside the mushroom. To their surprise, they met a group of teeny, tiny fairies who lived there! The fairies heard about BoBo's quest and wanted to help him find the magical rainbow. They told BoBo about a secret path that would lead them straight to the rainbow's end. Excited and grateful, BoBo, Chippy, and Spiky followed the secret path with the help of their new fairy friends. As they continued down the path, they finally spotted the most beautiful and dazzling rainbow they had ever seen! The rainbow was a mix of bright colors, just like the colors of their favorite fruits and flowers. Eagerly, they ran towards the end of the rainbow, and sure enough, they found a treasure chest! With hearts pounding, they opened the chest and found it filled with yummy treats, colorful toys, and a big, fluffy blanket.

The play group was designed not only to introduce Prince George to other children his age but also to give his parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, the opportunity to interact with other parents and their children in a more relaxed setting. It is without a doubt that the presence of the world's media added extra pressure on Prince George and his parents. However, it is essential to remember that, despite his royal status, Prince George is still a young child who is learning and experiencing new things like any other child of his age. By describing him as \\"very intrepid,\\" it reflects that he showed courage and was able to adapt well to his new environment, despite the additional pressures surrounding him. Prince George is growing up in a unique situation, constantly monitored by the public and the media, expected to behave exceptionally well at all times. In this play group, he demonstrated that he could adapt to new situations and be well-behaved in the presence of others. This is a time of learning and growth for not just Prince George, but also his parents, who are relatively new to parenthood as well. The play group allowed them to interact with other parents and form bonds, as well as learning from one another, which is an essential part of the parenting journey. In conclusion, while the presence of the global media is an added challenge for the young royal family, Prince George's behavior at the play group shows that his parents are doing their best to provide him with a normal upbringing and to teach him how to navigate and adapt to his high-profile life. The incident of theft can be seen as a typical childhood exploration, demonstrating that, like any other child his age, Prince George is curious and learning from his surroundings."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family name needed restoring? is inside the article: Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

Question: suppose There is lake nearby happens, how will it affect more chemicals are released. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: More Step 1: Understand the concept of acid rain Acid rain is formed when chemicals, specifically sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acids then fall to the ground through rain, snow, fog, or as dry particles. Step 2: Consider the location of the lake In the given scenario, there is a lake nearby the area where acid rain is occurring. Step 3: Analyze the effect of acid rain on the lake When acid rain falls onto the ground, it can wash off into nearby bodies of water, like lakes. This can make the water in the lake more acidic. Step 4: Consider what will happen if more chemicals are released If more chemicals (SO2 and NOx) are released into the atmosphere, this will lead to an increase in the amount of sulfuric acid and nitric acid being formed. Step 5: Analyze the consequences of an increased load of chemicals With more chemicals being released into the atmosphere, the subsequent increase of sulfuric acid and nitric acid will result in more acid rain. As a result, more acidic water will flow into the lake. This will increase the acidity of the lake and could cause harm to the ecosystem. Step 6: Choose the appropriate answer Based on the above analysis, if more chemicals are released into the atmosphere, it will affect the lake by increasing the acidity of its water. Therefore, the correct answer is A: More."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Zubeidaa is the story of Riyaz's (Rajit Kapoor) search to understand his mother, who is not known to him, as he was brought up by his maternal grandmother in the absence of his mother.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The time people in Silicon Valley wake up varies as it depends on personal preferences and work schedules. While there isn't an exact uniform time for everyone living in the region, patterns can be observed. Many tech professionals working in Silicon Valley are known for being early risers. Some famous entrepreneurs like Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, reportedly wake up around 4 or 5 am. This is partly because many of them adhere to the belief that they can be more productive by starting their day early. However, other individuals in the tech industry might prefer to work late into the night and wake up later in the day. Employee schedules will vary depending on the company's culture, the nature of work, and personal preferences. Coming to the second question, the number of start-ups in Silicon Valley is continually changing given the dynamic nature of the tech sector. As a major global hub for innovation, venture capital, and technology, the region has thousands of start-ups operating within its ecosystem. According to a report published in 2021 by Startup Genome, the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley combined form the number one start-up ecosystem worldwide. It is estimated that there are over 14,000 start-ups in this entire area. However, it is important to note that these numbers fluctuate regularly as new companies emerge, while others are either acquired or shut down. Silicon Valley remains an attractive destination where entrepreneurs from around the world come to build and scale innovative businesses. Regarding the similarity of the two questions, while both address aspects of life in Silicon Valley, the questions have distinct meanings. The first question inquires about the typical waking time of people residing in the region, whereas the second question asks about the number of start-ups operating in Silicon Valley. Both questions provide insights into the lifestyle and professional environment of individuals living and working in this world-renowned technology hub, but the focus of each question is different. The first question deals with daily routines and schedules, while the second question pertains more to the entrepreneurial and business landscape of the region."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Curse of Enchantia is a graphic adventure game developed and released by the British video game company Core Design for the PC DOS and Amiga in 1992 .

Shampooing and conditioning will remove unwanted oil and product build-up from your hair. Look for shampoo and conditioner products that are sulfate-free and jam packed with glycerin. Glycerin helps reduce frizz as it penetrates hair follicles, hydrating hair from the inside out. The closer glycerin is to the front of the ingredients list, the more it contains. Use a gentle shampoo and a smoothing conditioner. Straightening can be damaging to hair, even if your hair is thick and curly, so gentle products are important. When leaving in the conditioner in the shower, use a paddle brush to comb through your hair. This will help with the smoothening process while in the shower. Co-washing means washing your hair with only conditioner. Hair that's thick or curly is prone to more dryness than average hair. If your hair is very dry and frizzy, you should try co-washing your hair before straightening it. Your hair may benefit from being co-washed a few times a week. Shampoo can remove a lot of the natural moisture from hair. Using conditioner may reduce your hair's dryness. As straightening your hair can cause it to dry out, co-washing may be very helpful for someone with thick or curly hair. To co-wash your hair, saturate your hair with water. Then, massage in your chosen conditioner. Give your hair three to five minutes to absorb the conditioner and then wash it out. Do not rub! Wet hair is very weak and prone to damage. Blot the hair gently, and lightly wring the ends to soak-up moisture. Dry until it is slightly damp. Pat the hair downwards to promote straightening. Towel-drying in different directions enhances curls. Allow your hair to dry 90% of the way before you blow-dry. Concentrated hot air can frizz your hair. If you don't have either, use a small amount of the conditioner or a dime-sized amount of olive oil. These coat your hair to prevent the intense heat from causing split ends. Don’t overdo it. Too much leave-in conditioner can make your hair limp instead of straight. Wash your hair with only conditioner twice a week to keep from washing away natural hair oils. Use argan oil for thick hair. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To protect and care for your hair when flat-ironing, use gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and smoothing conditioner that contain glycerin to reduce frizz and hydrate hair.

Question: suppose the renal artery is obstructed happens, how will it affect nephrons filter more blood. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less If the renal artery becomes obstructed, it will negatively affect the nephrons' ability to filter blood. The renal artery is responsible for supplying blood to the kidneys, where the blood undergoes filtration through millions of nephrons. Nephrons are the key functional units of the kidneys and are responsible for the filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes that remove waste products and excess substances from the blood to maintain the body's electrolyte balance and blood volume. When the renal artery is obstructed, the blood flow to the kidneys is significantly reduced. This reduction in blood flow results in less blood reaching the nephrons for filtration. Consequently, the nephrons will not be able to filter blood as efficiently as they would with a normal, unobstructed renal artery. The ability of the nephrons to maintain a proper balance of electrolytes and blood volume in the body will also be compromised. The reduced filtration rate impairs the kidneys' overall function, potentially causing a buildup of waste products and toxins in the blood, which can be harmful to the body. Additionally, the diminished blood flow may lead to renal ischemia, a condition in which the kidney tissues receive inadequate oxygen supply. This decrease in the nephrons' filtration capacity may manifest in various symptoms and complications, including hypertension (due to the kidneys' inability to remove excess fluids), an increased risk of kidney disease, and a higher susceptibility to kidney failure if the obstruction is not addressed promptly.

In fact, the premise directly contradicts this hypothesis, as it states that Moors were involved in translation work alongside Jews and Benedictine monks. To further understand why this hypothesis is false, let's dive deeper into the historical context. During the Middle Ages, especially during the period known as the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), there was a great exchange of knowledge between different cultures, religions, and languages. Moorish Spain, also known as Al-Andalus, was an important intellectual center where scholars from various religious backgrounds interacted, shared, and translated works in multiple disciplines such as philosophy, science, and medicine. Moors, who were Muslims of North African and Iberian Peninsula descent, played a crucial role in this exchange of knowledge. They translated many works, particularly from ancient Greek and Arabic to Latin, which was the scholarly language of medieval Europe. This allowed European scholars to access previously unavailable knowledge, ultimately contributing to the European Renaissance. Jewish and Christian scholars, such as Benedictine monks, also contributed significantly to the translation efforts. Jewish scholars, who were proficient in Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin, were particularly indispensable as they acted as intermediaries between the Islamic and Christian worlds. Benedictine monks, committed to the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, often collaborated with Jewish and Moorish scholars, transcribing and translating texts into Latin. One of the well-known instances of such collaboration is the School of Translators in Toledo, Spain. Here, translation teams composed of Jews, Moors, and Christians actively exchanged knowledge and engaged in translating important texts. These teams translated works by notable ancient Greek philosophers and scientists, such as Aristotle and Galen, as well as Arab scholars like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. To summarize, the hypothesis \\"Moors never undertook any translation work.\\" is not only false, but it is also directly contradicted by the premise \\"Jews, Moors, and Benedictine monks worked alongside each other in translation teams.\\" Historical evidence shows that Moors actively participated in translation work, collaborating with Jewish and Christian scholars. These collaborative efforts were essential in the intellectual development of Europe and laid the foundation for the European Renaissance."},{"instruction":"In einem komplexen Arbeitsgang wird die kostbare Bohne, ebenfalls von Hand, vom Fruchtfleisch getrennt.

This was a very sad event that happened long ago, where many people were hurt during a big football game. These six kind cyclists wanted to help the people who were affected by this sad event. To have some fun, they parked their big van near a famous football stadium called Anfield. It's a very cool place where lots of football games happen. Then, they went inside to explore the stadium and enjoy a special tour. They were really excited about this! But, when they came back to their van, they found out that all their bicycles, special biking clothes, and other important equipment worth £30,000 were gone! That's a very big number, right? Someone had stolen their things while they were away. This made the cyclists very sad and upset.

Uhura on Star Trek talks about her groundbreaking career in television, space exploration, and the entertainment industry. It's not every day that you come across a television star who's made a significant impact on both the world of entertainment and space exploration. Nichelle Nichols, famously known for her groundbreaking role as Lieutenant Uhura on the cult-classic TV series Star Trek, has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on both realms. In this exclusive interview, we had the pleasure of delving into the remarkable journey of this glamorous actress, spanning from a stellar sci-fi career to her critical role as a recruiter for NASA. Perhaps one of the most memorable moments in television history was the iconic scene where Nichelle Nichols' Lt. Uhura and William Shatner's Captain Kirk shared one of the first interracial kisses on TV. This historic event occurred on November 22, 1968, in the Star Trek episode, \\"Plato's Stepchildren.\\" The scene, which was considered daring and groundbreaking during the Civil Rights Movement, served as a testament to the show's commitment to challenging societal norms and shattering racial barriers. Nichols recounts her apprehension about submitting to the kiss, citing worries about potential backlash from the audience. However, she trusted the creative minds behind Star Trek and their vision of a future where equality and acceptance were the norms. It turned out the response was overwhelmingly positive, garnering thousands of supportive letters from fans. Beyond the realm of fiction, Nichols played an instrumental role in shaping our real-life understanding of the cosmos. As an avid advocate for space exploration, she used her celebrity status to encourage young people, particularly women and people of color, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). From 1977 to 1987, Nichols worked with NASA, recruiting promising talents such as astronauts Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, and Guion Bluford, the first African American astronaut. Her passion for space exploration made her an ideal ambassador for NASA's visionary endeavours. Before becoming a household name through Star Trek, Nichols had already built an impressive resume on stage. Among her many accomplishments, she toured with jazz legend Duke Ellington as a dancer and singer. This experience helped shape her as a performer and further propelled her career in the entertainment industry. In our exclusive interview, Nichelle Nichols shares her incredible journey from the sets of Star Trek to the world of jazz, NASA, and beyond. She delves into the significance of her role as Lt. Uhura, reliving that historic interracial kiss, her passion for space exploration, and her experiences with Duke Ellington. Nichols' story is one of courage, talent, and determination—a testament to her iconic status as a trailblazer in both the entertainment industry and the world of space exploration. As we celebrate her countless achievements, we remain ever grateful to Nichelle Nichols for breaking racial barriers, inspiring generations of young people to reach for the stars, and paving the way for endless possibilities onscreen and in the real world. It is, without a doubt, that her story will continue to resonate in the hearts and minds of many for years to come."},{"instruction":"next question: The cows were enjoying the sunshine and solitude by the barn, where were they?

Based on the given options, the most logical and reasonable answer is that they were in the farmyard. The farmyard is the area near the barn or farmhouse where various farm animals, including cows, are typically found.

The goal was a result of a rare lapse in the Spanish defense, catching the European champions off guard and putting Switzerland in a commanding position. Spain, known for their attacking prowess and possession-based style, attempted to find an equalizer but was unable to break down the resolute Swiss defense. Switzerland's disciplined and organized performance paid off as they successfully repelled wave after wave of Spanish attacks. The usually potent Spanish frontline, boasting world-class talents such as David Villa and Fernando Torres, was left frustrated by a combination of well-timed tackles and outstanding goalkeeping. Spain's coach, Vicente del Bosque, made several tactical changes throughout the match in an effort to salvage at least a draw. However, despite creating numerous chances and dominating possession, Spain was unable to breach the Swiss fortress. The final whistle confirmed Switzerland's unexpected victory and left Spain facing an uphill battle to progress from Group H. Switzerland's historic win sent shockwaves throughout the tournament and was widely regarded as the first significant upset of the 2010 World Cup. The result shattered Spain's aura of invincibility and served as a timely reminder that no team, regardless of its talent and ranking, could take success for granted on the world stage. Following this defeat, Spain was under immense pressure to win their remaining group games against Chile and Honduras. Lessons learned from the opening shock against Switzerland enabled Spain to refocus, regroup, and ultimately embark on a historic winning streak, which culminated in their triumphant World Cup victory.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process of echolocation involves bats and other animals producing high-pitched tones that travel in waves. Once these sound waves hit objects in their environment, they bounce back towards the animal, allowing the animal to sense and assess the location, size, and shape of nearby objects. This ability relies on specialized structures in the animal's ears and brain, which have evolved specifically for interpreting echolocation signals. Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, if a bat is sick, its echolocation abilities might be affected, leading to weaker echolocation accuracy. The perturbation refers to any alteration in the bat's echolocation process due to sickness, which could result in direct or indirect effects on its ability to navigate and locate objects. 1. Direct effects: A sick bat may experience reduced energy levels, making it difficult for the bat to produce high-pitched tones with enough intensity for effective echolocation. It could also have an impact on the bat's hearing capacity, making it harder for the bat to detect and process the returned sound waves. 2. Indirect effects: A sickness could affect the bat's brain function, possibly obstructing its ability to accurately interpret the sound waves for spatial awareness. Additionally, the bat's sickness may make it more challenging for it to maintain its course or to focus on echolocation tasks, impairing the bat's overall ability to navigate and locate objects. To sum up, a sick bat could potentially experience weaker echolocation due to direct or indirect effects on the process of producing and interpreting sound waves. This situation may impair its ability to navigate, locate objects, and find food, affecting its overall survival and well-being."},{"instruction":"Question: The number of fish in a lake suddenly increases. How will the increase most likely affect the lake? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the factors contributing to the increase in fish population The sudden increase of fish in the lake could be caused by a variety of reasons, such as the introduction of non-native fish species, increased breeding, reduced predation, or favorable environmental factors. Step 2: Assess the impact on the food chain An increase in fish population will have a significant impact on the food chain within the lake ecosystem. The fish will have more competition for existing food resources, such as plankton and smaller aquatic organisms. This may lead to a decline in the populations of these organisms if the increased fish consumption outpaces their reproduction rate. Step 3: Analyze the effect on water quality An increase in fish population could also affect water quality. Higher fish density may result in more fish waste, which could lead to increased nutrient levels in the water, like ammonia and phosphorus. Excess nutrients can result in eutrophication or harmful algal blooms, which can negatively affect overall water quality and oxygen levels. Step 4: Consider the impact on predator populations Predator populations, such as birds and larger fish, may experience changes in response to the increased fish numbers. Initially, predators may benefit from the increase in prey availability, leading to growth in their populations. However, if the prey population becomes too large and depletes resources, it might affect the predators negatively in the long run. Step 5: Assess the overall impact on the lake ecosystem Taking into consideration the impact on the food chain, water quality, and predator populations, the most likely overall effect of a sudden increase in fish population would be a destabilization of the lake ecosystem. The imbalance in species interactions and the potential decline in water quality could lead to long-term negative consequences for the health of the lake and its inhabitants. In conclusion, the sudden increase in the number of fish in a lake will most likely affect the lake ecosystem through changes in food chain dynamics, water quality, and predator populations, potentially leading to long-term instability and negative impacts on the health of the lake and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage.

At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Where will Trump meet with Kim Jung Un? Options: A. not enough information B. North Korea C. South Korea D. Singapore A:","output":"D.

See options at the end Being in New York was comfortable for Neil but not Eric because OPTIONS: +Neil grew up in the city.; +Eric grew up in the city.;","output":"Being in New York was comfortable for Neil but not Eric because Neil grew up in the city. Growing up in an urban environment like New York City can have a significant impact on a person's level of comfort and familiarity with the fast-paced lifestyle, crowded streets, and the ever-changing environment. Neil, having been raised in this type of environment, has had the opportunity to develop an intimate understanding of the city and its nuances, which allows him to navigate and thrive in it like a second home. Growing up in New York City has exposed Neil to a diverse array of cultures, experiences, and opportunities that have shaped his perspective and way of life. He has an innate knowledge of the city's public transportation system and can efficiently navigate through congested subway stations and busy streets. Moreover, he is accustomed to the noise and energy that emanates from the city that never sleeps, allowing him to effortlessly adapt to the city's pace. On the other hand, Eric did not grow up in New York City, which would make it challenging for him to feel at ease in such an urban setting. Eric may have been raised in a suburban or rural area where the lifestyle, customs, and values are starkly different from those of a metropolitan city. As a result, he might find the city's characteristics to be overwhelming and unsettling. The rapid pace, noise levels, and tightly packed crowds could cause Eric to feel stressed and out of his element. Furthermore, Eric might struggle with using public transportation and might be unfamiliar with the proper etiquette and practices that locals, like Neil, may take for granted. In addition to transportation challenges, Eric may also face difficulties in adjusting to the cultural, social, and professional norms that prevail in a city such as New York. In conclusion, being in New York City was comfortable for Neil but not Eric because Neil grew up in the city. Neil's upbringing in New York provided him with a deep-rooted familiarity, allowing him to comfortably thrive amidst the city's unique vibe and pace. Meanwhile, Eric, who was not raised in such a setting, may find it difficult to adapt, and the city's characteristics are foreign and, at times, daunting. The disparity in comfort levels can be attributed to the vastly different experiences and environments they encountered during their formative years."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: additional models can be found here.","output":"To capitalize where necessary in the given sentence, I will do the following: 1.

Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record.

Investigation work starts on 26 June for up to four weeks meaning it will be shut to vehicles from 3 July on weekdays for a fortnight. When it was officially opened nearly 200 years ago, the structure was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world. However, it has become structurally unsafe and can now only be accessed by one light vehicle at a time. Northumberland County Council (NCC), Scottish Borders Council (SBC) and the Friends of Union Chain Bridge are working together on the project to safeguard the future of the bridge near Berwick-upon-Tweed. It requires urgent conservation and engineering repairs to secure its future. A funding bid for the restoration is now being prepared for the Heritage Lottery Fund, with a maximum of £5m available towards the bulk of the work. The county council's cabinet will meet next month to consider recommendations to contribute funding over three years towards the scheme, which it is hoped can be completed by 2020 - the 200th anniversary of the bridge's opening.

After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep. Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep. Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus and runs off. Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory.

First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone.

Ancient Greek philosophers, including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the nature of time.\\" Answer: A:","output":"According to the Vedas, the concept of time is cyclical and encompasses an intricate system of cycles within cycles. This understanding is deeply embedded in ancient Hindu cosmology, which postulates that the universe undergoes constant transformations through cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction. Each cycle is known as a \\"kalpa,\\" and it lasts for 4,320,000 years. To comprehend what happens after the universe dies, we need to examine the components of these cycles and their implications in the broader cosmic context. Vedic cosmology divides time into four yugas, or ages, which are the Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. These yugas sequentially represent golden, silver, bronze, and iron ages, with the gradual decline of dharma (righteousness) and an increase of adharma (unrighteousness) as the ages progress. Collectively, they comprise a single Mahayuga, which lasts approximately 4.32 million human years. After the end of a Mahayuga, the cycle repeats itself, signifying the cyclical nature of time. A kalpa, or a day of Lord Brahma, the creator god, consists of one thousand Mahayugas, equivalent to 4.32 billion human years. Likewise, a night of Brahma, known as a Pralaya or dissolution, has the same duration. At the end of each kalpa, when the universe \\"dies,\\" it enters a state of Pralaya. During Pralaya, the universe is in a dormant state, with all its constituents merging into the unmanifested, primordial cosmic substance. It is important to note that only the physical aspects of the universe dissolve in this phase, while the subtle aspects, such as the individual souls (atman), are not completely annulled. The Pralaya phase signifies the cosmic sleep, a period when the universe is devoid of manifested life. Although physically lifeless, the universe remains permeated with potential energy and information that will give rise to a new cycle of creation. After this phase of dissolution, the universe will be reborn, triggered by the awakening of Brahma from his slumber. This marks the beginning of a new kalpa, and the process of creation, preservation, and destruction resumes. These consecutive cycles of kalpas and pralayas form an unending succession, highlighting the eternal continuity of existence and non-existence of the universe. Consequently, after the \\"death\\" of the universe, it will undergo a period of dissolution before re-emerging from its dormant state to undergo another cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. This cyclical understanding of the universe's birth and death, based on Vedic cosmology, emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the perpetual transformation of matter, energy, and consciousness. The concept of time as eternal and cyclical in ancient Hindu philosophy, corroborated by the Vedas, conveys a deeper comprehension of the universe's origin and ultimate destiny beyond the scope of linear, human-defined time."},{"instruction":"Rewrite each original sentence in order to make it easier to understand by non-native speakers of English.

Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss., what would be the answer ?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering various modes of transportation that have significantly impacted the way people travel and connect around the world, several options come to mind. Automobiles have transformed road travel and allowed for easier transit between cities and towns. Trains have also played a crucial role in creating a well-connected transportation system that spans across countries. However, for covering even greater distances and crossing continents and oceans, one form of transportation stands out – aircraft. The development of aircraft in the early 20th century has revolutionized the way people travel. The ability to fly at high speeds and altitudes has allowed humans to cross vast distances much faster than any other mode of transportation. Aircrafts use the principles of aerodynamics, relying on lift produced by their wings to become airborne and using engines or propellers to maintain sustainable flight. This technology has given people the freedom to traverse the globe quickly and efficiently, reducing travel times from weeks to just hours. Interestingly, the first powered, heavier-than-air aircraft was invented by the Wright brothers in 1903, paving the way for the rapid evolution and growth of the aviation industry. Today, we have a multitude of aircraft types, from small single-propeller planes used for recreational flights to large commercial jetliners carrying hundreds of passengers long distances. Additionally, aircrafts play vital roles in various fields, such as aerial surveillance, cargo transport, military defense, and even space exploration. In conclusion, the profound impact of aircraft on our ability to travel and connect on a global scale makes them the answer to the question regarding the revolutionary mode of transportation for long-distance travel."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. and the situation: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Answer the following question: Which beaker's particles are moving slower?","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the particles in Beaker A are moving slower than those in Beaker X. To understand this, we must consider the role of temperature on the motion and energy of the particles. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy refers to the energy possessed by particles due to their movement. Therefore, when the temperature of a substance increases, the average kinetic energy of its particles also increases. As a result, the particles in the substance move more quickly. In the given scenario, Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner set to a low temperature, while Beaker X is on top of a burner with a high temperature. Consequently, the reactants in Beaker A have a lower temperature compared to the reactants in Beaker X. This difference in temperature implies that the particles in Beaker A possess lower kinetic energy compared to those in Beaker X. Since kinetic energy correlates with the speed of the particles' movement, this means that the particles in Beaker A are moving slower than those in Beaker X. Ultimately, this slower movement in Beaker A corresponds to a slower rate of reaction when compared to the reaction occurring in Beaker X. This further reinforces the concept that chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures, which can be observed in everyday situations like food spoilage and preservation."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: There are currently 1,034 taxi licences in the Croatian capital, and the number is now set to increase by 270.","output":"Şu anda Hırvatistan'ın başkenti olan Zagreb'de 1.034 tane taksi lisansı bulunmakta ve bu sayı şimdi 270 artacak.

Choices: - stomach acid - stool - fats - blood plasma A: A:","output":"The infection-fighting complement system consists of roughly 30 proteins in blood plasma. The complement system is an integral part of the immune system that works to defend the body against infections and eliminate harmful pathogens. Complement proteins are primarily found in blood plasma, the liquid component of blood, and are produced by the liver. These proteins interact with each other in a complex process known as the complement cascade, which serves to amplify the immune response and facilitate the removal of pathogens. Upon activation, the cascade of complement proteins can carry out several vital functions to help protect the body from invading pathogens. These functions include: 1. Opsonization: The process whereby complement proteins attach to the surface of pathogens, marking them for destruction and making it easier for immune cells (such as phagocytes) to engulf and destroy them. 2. Chemotaxis: Some complement proteins act as chemoattractants, signaling immune cells like neutrophils and monocytes to migrate to the site of infection and engage in the battle against the invading pathogens. 3. Direct pathogen killing: The formation of a Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) can occur, wherein complement proteins create a pore-like structure on the surface of pathogenic cells, leading to cell lysis and death. 4. Regulation of inflammation: Complement proteins can also modulate the inflammatory response, helping to recruit immune cells to the site of infection and amplifying the immune response. In conclusion, the infection-fighting complement system is comprised of approximately 30 proteins that are primarily found in blood plasma. Their essential role within the immune system includes the detection, marking, and elimination of pathogens, as well as coordinating immune cell activity and regulating inflammation during an infection."},{"instruction":"Translate from Spanish to English: Actualmente tengo el iPhone 4.","output":"Step 1: Recognize the language and text to be translated.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would experiment A's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment B's hydroxide? Hint: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. Answer:","output":"Experiment A's hydroxide would have a smaller surface area than experiment B's hydroxide. In experiment A, solid pellets of NaOH are used. These pellets have a smaller surface area exposed to the HCl gas, as the hydroxide ions on the interior of the pellet are not in contact with the HCl molecules. The acid-base reaction between the gaseous HCl molecules and the hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet is relatively slow due to the limited surface area for these reactions to occur. In experiment B, the NaOH pellets are ground into smaller pieces, which greatly increases the total surface area of the NaOH. This increased surface area allows more hydroxide ions to be exposed to the HCl gas, enhancing the chances for collisions between the HCl molecules and the hydroxide ions, and thereby increasing the overall reaction rate. Therefore, based on the information provided in the prompt and the hint, it can be concluded that experiment A's hydroxide has a smaller surface area compared to experiment B's hydroxide. This smaller surface area of experiment A's hydroxide contributed to a slower acid-base reaction with the HCl gas, while the larger surface area of experiment B's hydroxide led to a faster reaction between the two substances."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Steven Seagal stars as a tough cop, Jacob King, whose brutal methods have gained him a legendary reputation among his colleagues.

On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\\" said George Washington University Law...

What kind of thing would the answer to the question \\"What does \`\` saute '' mean ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value? OPTIONS: - description - entity - abbreviation - human - numeric - location","output":"When answering the question \\"What does 'saute' mean?\\", I will analyze the given options step-by-step to identify the most appropriate option. 1. Description: A saute definition would provide information about the cooking technique, presenting a description of the term. This option seems promising. 2. Entity: An entity refers to a specific thing, such as an object or event. The answer to what saute means does not represent an entity. 3. Abbreviation: An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Saute is not an abbreviation, so this option is not applicable. 4. Human: A human refers to a person. Saute is a cooking term, not a person, so this option is not appropriate. 5. Numeric: Numeric values involve numbers or quantities. Saute is a word describing a cooking method and is not related to numbers. 6. Location: A location refers to a place or geographical area. Saute is not a location, as it is a cooking technique. After evaluating each option, it is safe to say that the answer to the question \\"What does 'saute' mean?\\" falls under the category of a \\"description\\" because it provides information about a particular cooking method. So, my choice is: - description"},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl - Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter - Mix until smooth - Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high - Pour batter onto the griddle - Question: suppose the pancakes will be more salty happens, how will it affect MORE pancakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the different steps of the pancake-making process and identify the relevant variables that might be affected by an increase in saltiness. Step 1: Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl - This step involves combining the dry ingredients. If there is more salt in the mixture, the pancakes will indeed be saltier. Step 2: Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter - In this step, the wet ingredients are added to the dry mixture. Since neither milk, eggs, nor butter have a significant impact on the saltiness, the increased saltiness is unaffected by this step. Step 3: Mix until smooth - This step is aimed at reaching a uniform consistency. The amount of salt in the batter remains unchanged. Step 4: Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium-high - The heat level does not impact saltiness. Step 5: Pour batter onto the griddle - Again, the amount of salt in the batter remains unchanged. In conclusion, if the pancakes are saltier, it will have no effect on the other ingredients, process steps, or overall production of the pancakes. The pancake's taste will be influenced, but not its quantity or how it's made. So, the answer is \\"no effect\\" on other aspects of the pancake-making process."},{"instruction":"Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Also at Vitagraph was a young actor, Harry Solter, who was looking for \\"a young, beautiful equestrian girl\\" to star in a film to be produced by the Biograph Studios under the direction of D.W. Griffith. Griffith, the most prominent producer-director at Biograph Studios, had noticed the beautiful blonde-haired woman in one of Vitagraph's films. Because the film's actors received no mention, Griffith had to make discreet inquiries to learn she was Florence Lawrence and to arrange a meeting. Griffith had intended to give the part to Biograph's leading lady, Florence Turner, but Lawrence managed to convince Solter and Griffith that she was the best suited for the starring role in The Girl and the Outlaw. With the Vitagraph Company, she had been earning 20 a week, working also as a costume seamstress over and above acting. Griffith offered her a job, acting only, for 25 a week. After her success in this role, she appeared as a society belle in Betrayed by a Handprint and as an Indian in The Red Girl. In total, she had parts in most of the 60 films directed by Griffith in 1908. Toward the end of 1908 Lawrence married Harry Solter. Lawrence gained much popularity, but because her name was never publicized, fans began writing the studio asking for it. Even after she had gained wide recognition, particularly after starring in the highly successful Resurrection, Biograph Studios refused to publicly announce her name and fans simply called her \\"The Biograph Girl\\". During cinema's formative years, silent screen actors were not named, because studio owners feared that fame might lead to demands for higher wages. She continued to work for Biograph in 1909. Her demand to be paid by the week rather than daily was met, and she received double the normal rate. She achieved great popularity in the \\"Jones\\" series, filmdom's first comedy series, in which she played Mrs. Jones in around a dozen films. More popular still were the dramatic love stories in which she co-starred with John R. Cumpson, as Mr. Jones, and Arthur Johnson. The two played husband and wife in The Ingrate, and the adulterous lovers in Resurrection. Lawrence and Solter began to look elsewhere for work, writing to the Essanay Company to offer their services as leading lady and director. Rather than accepting this offer, however, Essanay reported the offer to Biograph's head office, and they were promptly fired. Is there anything else I should know about Florence Lawrence during this time?","output":"During this time, Florence Lawrence and her husband, Harry Solter, decided to join Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP) in 1910. Laemmle, the founder of the future Universal Studios, was determined to challenge the monopoly of the Motion Picture Patents Company, which had previously controlled the film industry. Laemmle recognized the potential in Florence Lawrence and devised a clever publicity stunt to promote her, making her the first publicly named movie star. He spread a rumor that \\"The Biograph Girl\\" had been killed in a streetcar accident, and after a few days, he took out an advertisement in various newspapers revealing that she was alive and well, and that she would soon appear in IMP films. As a result, Florence Lawrence became widely known and very popular, enjoying significant stardom in the early days of Hollywood. She starred in more than 50 films for IMP throughout 1910, including director Harry Solter's debut film, Love's Sweet Quarrel. Unfortunately, her fame was short-lived as she suffered a series of personal and career setbacks, ultimately losing her star status by the late 1910s. However, it is important to recognize her contributions to the early film industry, not only as an actress but also as a pioneer who helped pave the way for future movie stars."},{"instruction":"In what year was the most expensive Korean movie in history released?","output":"The most expensive Korean movie in history as of now, \\"The Battleship Island\\" (also known as \\"Gunhamdo\\"), was released in 2017.

Which person read more about humidity? Two neighbors attended the same school. Mike learned about biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school. Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. Answer:","output":"Dan read more about humidity since he learned more about the weather, and humidity is a component of weather conditions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital. Seemingly minutes after they leave, gunshots are heard outside and the lights... My question: Why do they race back to the house? Answer:","output":"They race back to the house for several reasons: 1. Safety: After witnessing the alien's abilities and aggressive actions, such as the use of a ray-gun on a cow and burning Brian's hand, the brothers understand the potential danger they and their family are in. Going back to the house provides a familiar environment where they can regroup, gather their family, and plan their next move. They instinctively feel that the house offers better protection than being out in the open with the alien threat looming. 2. Convincing the family: The brothers know that their family is skeptical about their claims of alien encounters. Racing back to the house allows them to show their agitated and fearful state, reinforcing the urgency of the situation. They need to convince their family to flee, and being physically present gives them a better chance to persuade them. 3. Sharing evidence: Tommy has captured the alien encounter on tape, which serves as concrete evidence to back up their story. By racing back to the house, they can play the footage for their incredulous family, removing any doubt about the authenticity of their claims. This would encourage the family to take the threat seriously and act accordingly. 4. Protecting the family: As the situation escalates, the brothers are concerned for the safety of their family members, especially since the aliens are now aware of their presence. By returning to the house, they can be close to their loved ones and try to defend them from any possible harm. 5. Group decision-making: Being together as a family allows for collective discussion and decision-making in the face of the unknown threat. By racing back to the house, the brothers aim to keep everyone informed and involved in determining the best course of action for their survival. In summary, the decision to race back to the house stems from the brothers' instinct to protect their family, share their experience and evidence with them, and to strategize together on their best chance of escaping the alien threat."},{"instruction":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer.

Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

We've seen how automation has eliminated jobs in certain markets. What effect will AI have on the job market and other ways of life in the future?","output":"These two questions have some similarities, but they are not the same. While both questions touch upon the topic of job elimination and automation technology, they approach the subject from different angles and ask for different types of information. The first question, \\"What are the jobs Quora has eliminated?\\", is asking specifically about the jobs that have been eliminated by Quora, the question and answer website company. This question is focused on a specific company and its impact on the labor market. To answer this question, one would need to research and discuss any instances where Quora has implemented technology or strategies that led to the elimination of certain positions within the company or any direct consequences its platform has had on people's employment. The scope of this question is limited to Quora alone, and doesn't widely ask about the effect of automation on the job market in general. The second question, \\"We've seen how automation has eliminated jobs in certain markets. What effect will AI have on the job market and other ways of life in the future?\\", is a broader enquiry that explores the larger ramifications of artificial intelligence and automation technology on the overall job market and other aspects of human life. While the question acknowledges that automation has already eliminated jobs in some markets, it seeks insights into future implications that AI may bring, both in terms of employment opportunities and daily life. To address this question, one could discuss several possible effects of AI on job market, which may include: 1. Job displacement: The automation of routine tasks may lead to the reduction or elimination of certain job positions, especially those that require low-skilled labor. This can result in people losing their jobs or needing to acquire new skills to adapt to the changing job market. 2. Job creation: AI may generate new jobs that didn't previously exist, such as AI specialists, data analysts, and robotics engineers. These new roles will require expertise in AI technology and its various applications, which could boost job opportunities for skilled individuals. 3. Changing nature of work: As artificial intelligence continues to develop, it may facilitate a transformation in the nature of work itself. Jobs may become more focused on creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills, which are not easily replicated by AI. 4. Societal impact: Adoption of AI could lead to improved efficiency and productivity in various industries, potentially leading to economic growth and improved standard of living. However, it may also exacerbate income inequality, as the benefits of AI technology might not be equally distributed among the population. In conclusion, while the two questions revolve around the theme of job elimination and automation technology, they approach it from different perspectives. The first relates to the specific impact of Quora on job elimination, while the second delves into the broader implications of AI on the job market and other aspects of life in the future."},{"instruction":"in the following nights the same happened, therefore, the mining of this sea area was quitted.

Step 1: There is a rain cloud in the sky. - This indicates that there is moisture in the atmosphere, which is a prerequisite for rain or other precipitation. Step 2: Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other. - This causes friction between the particles, resulting in the transfer of charge from one particle to another. Step 3: The collisions create electrical charge. - As a result of the friction, there is a separation of charges within the cloud. Step 4: Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud. - Since these particles have a lower mass, they are more influenced by gravity and thus move towards the bottom of the cloud. Step 5: Heavier, negatively charged particles rise to the top. - These particles have a larger mass and are less influenced by gravity. Due to the repulsion between like charges, they rise further up within the cloud. Final step: When the electrical charge within the cloud becomes large enough, a discharge of electricity occurs, commonly known as a lightning strike. This discharge seeks to equalize the charge imbalance within the cloud and between the ground and the cloud, resulting in the phenomenon we observe as lightning."},{"instruction":"Teď to vzdát nesmíte.

Though often associated with its largest funders, the Koch brothers, it has a long history of attracting a diverse array of financial support. While the Kochs are undoubtedly important contributors, it is essential to recognize the diverse funding base that supports the organization. In this article, we will explore the various sources of funding that allow the Cato Institute to maintain its pursuit of a free and open society. The Kochs and Cato Institute Charles and David Koch founded the Cato Institute in 1977 alongside Murray Rothbard and Ed Crane. Their goal was to create a platform for the libertarian movement that would promote free-market economic policies, limited government, and non-interventionist foreign policies. The Koch brothers have been the most high-profile supporters of the organization, but they are not the only sources of funding. It is worth noting that their contributions have decreased since the 1980s, as they diversified their donations to other libertarian and conservative causes. Other Foundations and Donors The Cato Institute receives financial support from many other foundations and individual donors, who contribute to its annual operating budget. Some of the more notable foundations include: 1. The Searle Freedom Trust: Founded by Daniel C. Searle in 1998, the trust primarily supports policy research and development organizations committed to individual liberty and economic freedom. It has provided significant funding to the Cato Institute for a variety of programs and initiatives. 2. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation: Named after two industrialists, this foundation focuses on promoting American democratic capitalism and its supporting culture and institutions. The foundation supports the Cato Institute's projects related to these objectives. 3. John Templeton Foundation: Established in 1987, the John Templeton Foundation primarily supports research about religion, spirituality, and values across various disciplines. The foundation funds Cato Institute projects that align with its mission to explore the spiritual dimensions of freedom and the role they play in a free society. 4. The John M. Olin Foundation: Though it is no longer active, the John M. Olin Foundation was a significant funder of the Cato Institute during its existence. The foundation's purpose was to promote the free market and conservative ideologies in academia, think tanks, and public policy organizations. 5. The Earhart Foundation: Another early funder of the Cato Institute, the Earhart Foundation supported free-market scholars and policy research in its heyday. It provided funding for a number of research initiatives and studies at the Cato Institute. 6. Individual Donors: Thousands of individual donors contribute to the Cato Institute's funding. A vast majority of individual donors are not high-profile names, but their contributions are vital to the organization's financial stability. Corporate Donors A select group of corporations also supports the Cato Institute. While the think tank does not disclose the identities of all its corporate donors, some are publicly available. For example, Verizon, Philip Morris, and Coca-Cola are known to be occasional donors. These corporations often support specific research initiatives or events sponsored by the Cato Institute. Conclusion The Cato Institute's financial support extends far beyond the Koch brothers. While they have been instrumental in the organization's foundation and early growth, a diverse mix of foundations, individual donors, and corporate donors now support the Cato Institute. This wide range of financial support reflects the organization's appeal to a broad cross-section of individuals and organizations committed to libertarian values and free-market principles. Understanding the Cato Institute's funding base provides a clearer perspective on its mission and the impact of its research and advocacy in shaping public policy."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: As Good as It Gets Movie plot: Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a 60 year old misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City working on his 62nd book. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence (Jesse James). Unable to adjust to another waitress, Melvin arranges through his publisher (Linda Gehringer) whose husband is a doctor (Harold Ramis) to pay for her son's considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work. She is overwhelmed at his generosity, and they agree there will be no physical relationship. Meanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse. Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills. Frank convinces him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money. Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself, Melvin...

They are a largely a studio-based outfit that has only toured around their native country. - Portugal (Portuguese: ), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: ), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe. To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain. The PortugalSpain border is long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union. The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Green Carnation is a progressive metal band from Kristiansand, Norway formed in 1990. Green Carnation's trend of music has continuously become less and less heavy after every release; from straight forward death metal, to a progressive doom metal sound, to an atmospheric gothic metal sound, to a melancholic hard rock sound and in 2006, went as far as to releasing an entirely acoustic album \\"Acoustic Verses\\". - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - The Edgar Allan Poe Awards (popularly called the Edgars), named after Edgar Allan Poe, are presented every year by the Mystery Writers of America, based in New York City. They honor the best in mystery fiction, non-fiction, television, film, and theater published or produced in the previous year. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Carpathian Forest is a Norwegian black metal band formed by Nattefrost and Nordavind in 1992. - Geography. Abstatt is situated in the south of the district of Heilbronn at the Schozach river. Heilbronn is about to the northwest. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Sound Riot Records is an independent record label founded in March 1994 in Brazil. The company started as a small mailorder service for demo-tapes and 7\\"EPs. In the same year, the CD distribution started and Sound Riot Records became the official distributor for European record labels such as Displeased, Misanthropy, Holy, No Fashion, Cold Meat Industry, Avantgarde Music, and among others. The idea to running an own record label came during 1995 and the debut release came out in March 1996. In March 1999, they decided to move to Europe. Since then, the company is based in Portugal and they have signed various European black, doom, death and power metal bands such as Tristwood, Requiem, Chain Collector, Excalion, Infernum, Frostmoon and Svartsyn. - Avantgarde Music is an Italian record label, formed as a continuation of Obscure Plasma Records, focusing on black and doom metal artists. The label has a sub-label called Wounded Love Records, which has released albums by Dolorian and Taake. - Tana French (born 1973) is an Irish novelist and theatrical actress born in Vermont. Her debut novel \\"In the Woods\\" (2007), a psychological mystery, won the Edgar, Anthony, Macavity, and Barry awards for best first novel. She lives in Dublin. The British online newspaper, \\"The Independent\\", has referred to her as the First Lady of Irish Crime, \\"who very quietly has become a huge international name among crime fiction readers.\\" - Kristiansand , historically Christiansand, is a city and municipality in Norway. It is the fifth largest city in Norway and the municipality is the sixth largest in Norway, with a population of 88 598 as of June 2016.

The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - In the Woods is a 2007 mystery novel by Tana French about a pair of Irish detectives and their investigation of the murder of a twelve-year-old girl.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Svartsyn is a black metal band from Sweden. The band formed in 1991 as Chalice, but changed their name to Svartsyn in 1993. They recorded their first demo in 1994 and their first album in 1998. Draugen, ex-drummer of Dark Funeral, teamed up with original founding member Ornias in 1996 and since then, they are working smoothly together. In 1996 Svartsyn signed to Folter Records and released their debut album \\"The True Legend\\". In May of the following year, a tour of 9 dates in the Netherlands and Germany with Behemoth and Desaster was made. After this tour, Kolgrim (of Unpure) replaced Surth. In June 1997 Svartsyn released \\"Tormentor\\" 7 EP. In September 1997 and October 1998 Svartsyn recorded their 2nd album entitled \\"Bloodline\\" at Sunlight Studios, which was released as a limited D-LP by End All Life Productions from Italy. In February 2000, Svartsyn recorded their 3rd album \\"His Majesty\\" at Voisin Studios and they signed to Sound Riot Records for the release of this album. In 2003, Svartsyn signed with Sound Riot Records again for the release of their fourth album \\"Destruction of Man\\" and for the re-print of \\"Bloodline\\" album including the \\"Tormentor\\" 7 EP as bonus track. \\"Destruction of Man\\" was released in the summer 2003 and \\"Bloodline\\" in September 2005. Their latest album is \\"Timeless Reign\\" which has been released through Carnal Records from Sweden. - Chain Collector is a heavy metal band from Norway that formed in 2003 . Some of the members originated from other bands such as Green Carnation , Carpathian Forest , Trail of Tears , Dismal Euphony and In the Woods . In 2004 , the Forthcoming Addiction demo , containing four songs , was recorded at DUB studio . The band signed a two album record deal with Sound Riot Records in September 2004 , but due to the touring of some members with their other bands at the beginning the year , the production of The Masquerade was not finished until March 2005 . In July 2005 the German label Massacre Records became interested in the band , and Sound Riot Records licensed the Chain Collector album to them . Massacre Records released The Masquerade in Europe , Canada , and Australia in November 2005 , while Sound Riot Records released their edition in December 2005 . The band parted ways with Sound Riot and released the second album , Unrestrained in 2007 . - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal or technical metal) is a fusion genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock which combines the loud \\"aggression\\" and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or \\"pseudo-classical\\" compositions of the latter. Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool, Symphony X and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success; additionally, many other thrash and death metal bands started to incorporate elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it still remains a largely diffused underground genre with a committed fan base. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Dear Theresa, When we met in Glasgow on Monday, I wished you well for the negotiations that lie ahead now that you have formally invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. I want to reiterate those good wishes now. I very much hope that you succeed in realising your ambitions for the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. A good deal for the UK is clearly in Scotland's interests whatever constitutional future we choose. It is for that reason that I intend that the Scottish government will play a full and constructive role in securing such an outcome. I expressed my frustration on Monday that the process leading up to the invoking of Article 50 had failed to involve the devolved administrations in any meaningful way - a view that I know is shared by the First Minister of Wales. Far from securing a UK-wide approach ahead of invoking Article 50 - as you committed to do last July - the voices of the devolved administrations were largely ignored and all attempts at compromise rejected, in most cases with no prior consultation. As we move forward into a new phase, we need to agree a more direct role and influence for the devolved administrations, reflecting the key interests that are at stake for all of us. However, whatever outcome is secured, it seems inevitable that it will remove the UK, not just from the EU, but also from the single market. As you are aware, that is not an outcome that the people of Scotland voted for. It is also an outcome that will have significant implications for our economy, society and place in the world. In these very changed circumstances, the people of Scotland must have the right to choose our own future - in short, to exercise our right of self determination. Indeed I noted the importance you attached to the principle of self determination in your letter to President Tusk. As you are aware, the Scottish Parliament has now determined by a clear majority that there should be an independence referendum. The purpose of such a referendum is to give people in Scotland the choice of following the UK out of the EU and single market on the terms you negotiate, or becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and build a genuine partnership of equals with the other nations of the UK. A copy of the motion passed by Parliament on 28 March 2017 is attached. The decision of the Scottish Parliament has been made in line with the tradition of popular sovereignty in Scotland - that the people of Scotland should be able to determine the form of government most suited to their needs - and with the clear commitment in the manifesto on which my government was re-elected last May. I am therefore writing to begin early discussions between our governments to agree an Order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 that would enable a referendum to be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament. I have, of course, noted and carefully considered your public position. However, it seems that we are in agreement on the essential matters. For example we agree that now is not the time for a referendum. You confirmed to me on Monday, and repeated in your letter invoking Article 50, that you intend the terms of both the UK's exit from the EU and of a future trade deal to be agreed before March 2019 and in time for ratification by other member states - in other words, between the autumn of next year and the spring of 2019. As you are aware, this is the timescale endorsed by the Scottish Parliament for a referendum. As I have said previously, if the timetable you have set out changes, we will require to consider the implications for the timing of a referendum. However, it seems reasonable at this stage to work on the basis of your stated timetable. We are also in agreement that - unlike the EU referendum - the choice must be an informed one. That means that both the terms of Brexit and the implications and opportunities of independence must be clear in advance of the referendum. It is also worth noting that the clear precedent of the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement should make reaching agreement on this occasion a relatively straightforward process - addressing any concern you may have that discussions would be time-consuming for your government when they are also preparing for EU negotiations. In light of the above, there appears to be no rational reason for you to stand in the way of the will of the Scottish Parliament and I hope you will not do so. However, in anticipation of your refusal to enter into discussions at this stage, it is important for me to be clear about my position.

Throughout the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but re-formed a year later without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. Context: In 1991, Fear Factory recorded a series of cuts for their debut album with the then-little-known producer Ross Robinson in Blackie Lawless' studio. The band's members were unhappy with the terms of their recording contract and caused a delay with the album's release. The band retained the rights to the songs, many of which they re-recorded in 1992 with a different producer, Colin Richardson, for inclusion on their debut release Soul of a New Machine. Meanwhile, Ross Robinson obtained the rights to the recording, which he used to promote himself as a producer. The album was officially released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records under the title Concrete after the band's breakup. The release was controversial because the album was issued because of the band's outstanding contractual obligation and without the approval of every band member. Fan opinion has been divided as to whether Ross Robinson's production properly captured the intricacies of the band's sound. The released album favored a straight-up approach and Robinson's distinct drum sound. Concrete has become an important album for fans of the early Fear Factory sound; it can be seen as a bridge between the band's sound on their demo recordings and their debut release, Soul of a New Machine, and a blueprint for later songs and B-sides. Based on the Concrete recording, Max Cavalera recommended Fear Factory to the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, which offered the band a recording contract. While the band signed the contract, it has since become controversial because of Roadrunner's treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup. This was reflected in the first album Archetype (2004), which was released following the band's re-formation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, \\"Slave Labor\\", was direct about the band's feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, Andrew Shives was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of Soul of a New Machine. Question: When was Concrete released?. Whats the answer?","output":"Concrete was released in 2002."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: This is a common style, likely because of its excellent protection and simple method.

Here's a step-by-step justification of the process: 1. Plants start growing on or near the rocks: This is the first step where plants establish themselves on or near rocks. This typically occurs in areas where environmental conditions, such as soil, nutrients, and moisture, favor plant growth. 2. The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock: As plants grow, their roots expand and become more robust. These roots exert pressure on the rock, physically breaking the rock apart into smaller pieces. The mechanical action of the roots creates crevices and cracks in the rock, further facilitating the process of weathering. 3. The plant acids dissolve the rock: In addition to the physical action of the roots breaking up the rock, plant roots also release various acids that chemically dissolve the rock. One such example is the release of carbonic acid, which forms when carbon dioxide from root respiration combines with water in the soil. The acid reacts with minerals in the rock, chemically breaking down the rock and releasing nutrients necessary for plant growth. 4. The rock is broken down into smaller pieces: This is the final step of the process, where both the mechanical and chemical actions mentioned earlier have successfully broken down the rock into smaller particles. The smaller pieces continue to break down further and eventually become part of the soil, providing essential nutrients to the plants and other organisms in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a list of integers and you need to find the absolute value of the difference between each two consecutive values.

Solve 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 for r.","output":"To solve the given equation 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 for the variable 'r', we first combine terms to simplify the equation. Let's combine the terms that contain 'r', 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 simplifies to 0 = -11*r + 33 Next, we want to isolate the 'r' term. To do so, we will subtract 33 from both sides of the equation. Doing this we get: -33 = -11*r In order to solve for 'r', we have to divide both sides of the equation by -11. So, r = -33 / -11 This simplifies to r = 3. So, the solution to the equation 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 is r = 3. This means that when r is equal to 3, the original equation is true.

Answer:","output":"Jenny, who got infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), had a higher risk of developing skin cancer compared to her brother Josh, who got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of various cancers, including skin cancer. HPV can cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common skin cancer types. In addition, HPV is known to cause cancers of the cervix, anus, and penis, highlighting its significant role in carcinogenesis.

I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas.

This rule is in place to prevent easy double or triple plays. As for tagging up in an infield fly situation, here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. Infield fly rule is called: When the umpire calls an infield fly, the batter is automatically out. At this point, the runners on base should be aware of the situation. 2. The ball is in play: Even though the batter is out, the ball is still considered in play until it is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground. 3. Runners can tag up: Since the ball is in play, the baserunners can tag up just as they would in any other fly ball situation. Once the ball is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground, they must retouch or remain on their starting base. 4. Advancing is risky: Although runners can technically tag up on an infield fly, it is usually not a good idea to try to advance. Infield fly balls are typically easy for fielders to catch, and the baserunners would be susceptible to being thrown out if they attempt to advance. In conclusion, while baserunners can tag up on an infield fly, it is generally not recommended due to the high risk of being thrown out at the next base. Instead, baserunners should focus on safely returning to their original base after tagging up."},{"instruction":"Information: - René Wolff (born 4 April 1978 in Erfurt) is an Olympic and world champion track cyclist from Germany. - Formula Three, also called Formula 3 or F3, is a class of open-wheel formula racing.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","output":"The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, mainly following the Gelug school. In contrast, the concept of Barzakh comes from Islamic eschatology. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Dalai Lama would believe in the divine Barzakh, as it belongs to a different belief system. To briefly elaborate on both concepts: 1. Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhism: The Dalai Lama is the title given to the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people. It is believed that each Dalai Lama is a reincarnation of the previous one, representing the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Avalokiteśvara. Tibetan Buddhism focuses on achieving enlightenment or \\"nirvana\\" through practicing compassion, wisdom, and inner transformation. Different traditions within Tibetan Buddhism, like Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug, have varying approaches, with the Dalai Lama mainly following the Gelug school. 2. Barzakh in Islamic Eschatology: The term \\"Barzakh\\" comes from Islamic teachings and refers to the intermediary stage or \\"isthmus\\" between one's worldly life and the afterlife. After death, the souls of individuals enter Barzakh, awaiting the Day of Resurrection (or the Day of Judgment). During this period, the souls undergo a sort of preliminary judgment based on their good and bad deeds in the world. The concept of Barzakh is primarily mentioned in the Quran and elaborated further by Hadith literature and Islamic scholars. As you can see, the Dalai Lama and the concept of Barzakh belong to two distinct religious beliefs, making it unlikely that the Dalai Lama would believe in the divine Barzakh. While both Buddhism and Islam deeply explore the cosmic order, spirituality, and the afterlife, they maintain different perspectives on these matters."},{"instruction":"The first section was open on December 15 , 1907 from Pasco to the west of Cliffs ( near Maryhill ) , a length of , opened .

Musharraf had been asked to attend the hearing on Wednesday at the grand national library building in the heart of the capital, where if he is found guilty of treason could see the 70-year-old former general sentenced to death. But his lawyers said he was unable to attend after police found an explosive device along the route Musharraf would have taken to the historic hearing – the first time a former chief of Pakistan's powerful army has ever been put on trial. It was the third time that small bombs have been found near the luxurious residence of the former general, who the Pakistani Taliban have repeatedly vowed to kill. Musharraf failed to turn up to the first hearing of three-judge special court on 24 December when a bomb and weapons were discovered along the road. Tayyab Mahmood Jafri, part of the large team of prosecution lawyers, heaped scorn on yet another discovery of explosives. \\"How could a bomb be put there when the entire route is patrolled? The whole thing is just completely managed so they can play delaying tactics and avoid coming to the court,\\" he said during a break during proceedings at a complex in the country's administrative centre. \\"The brave soldier is afraid of three unarmed judges.\\" Police and commandos surrounded the national library, where the case is being heard in a chilly auditorium. Despite major security precautions the police told judge Faisal Arab they could only provide protection \\"within the available resources\\", which did not include a bombproof vehicle to convey the former president. The defence team warned that the entire building was at risk of being bombed. Anwar Mansoor Khan, a lead defence lawyer, told the court that his car was rammed shortly after the last hearing by an unidentified four-wheel drive vehicle. But the judge appeared unimpressed by the arguments over security fears, noting that courts continue to operate during times of war. And he indicated that he could order the arrest of Musharraf, forcing him to attend the court under armed guard. He said he had not yet taken that step to avoid any embarrassment to a former president and army chief. Musharraf's lawyers argued the case against their client flouted the constitution, was being heard by judges who could not be considered neutral and had been triggered by prime minister Nawaz Sharif's quest for \\"vengeance\\". Although Musharraf toppled Sharif from power in 1999 when he seized power in a coup d'état, the treason trial only relates to his activities in late 2007 when he introduced a period of emergency rule and suspended senior judges. The case is the most serious of the legal difficulties that have beset the former general since his return to Pakistan last March, when he was put under house arrest for various cases, including his alleged involvement in the death of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. He has since been bailed on all the private prosecutions, which most legal experts say he can expect to win. However, the government-initiated treason trial is considered to be a far trickier legal battle. Musharraf has claimed he still has significant support from the army, and many analysts still believe a way will be found to spare his life and send him back into exile abroad. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former military ruler, failed to appear at his treason trial after explosives were discovered near his house on the outskirts of Islamabad. Musharraf had been asked to attend the hearing, where, if found guilty of treason, he could face a death sentence. This marks the first time a former chief of Pakistan's powerful army has ever been put on trial.

Graham – who was engaged at the time of the incident — denied the allegations and partner Andrew stood by her. But the General Teaching Council for Scotland barred her from the job following a probe. Their panel found she had “repeatedly engaged in sexual activity” with the boy after giving him booze and sharing a bed with him. Graham — mum to a baby boy — had argued that her drink had been spiked and she couldn’t remember what had happened. She described herself as a “victim”, and referring to the photo said: “The person in the bed is clearly not in control of the situation.” Pictures of the couple have now emerged showing them putting on a united front and holding hands as they emerged from their Hampshire home. The disgraced former Miss has since started a new life — helping to spread religion among squaddies. She resigned from her job as a French teacher at Whitburn Academy, West Lothian, after the shocking allegations emerged and has since set up home down south in Aldershot, Hants. And the devout Christian — who gave birth to her first child last week — now goes by her middle and married names Shona Wilkie. Shamed Graham and her husband, both 28, are working together for the Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Scripture Readers Association (SASRA), based near military barracks. She is in the ‘donor relations’ department of the organisation — which describes itself as introducing squaddies to Jesus — while Andrew is a support officer. Last night a source said: “Maybe this is her way of repenting for her guilt. “SASRA brings Jesus to squaddies and she’s part of the head office staff. “She’s using her middle and married name to get away from her past but a few folk know. “She’s very recently had a baby too so she must be all over the place.” Graham romped with the teenager at a Travelodge in Edinburgh following his prom at the city’s Carlton Highland hotel. A probe was launched after a photograph emerged on social media showing the lad holding what appears to be a bottle of bubbly at the door of a hotel room while a blonde woman sleeps in the bed. The image was captioned by one student with the words: “Poor show from Miss Graham. “I had higher respect for my teacher than this! Disgusting.” A lawyer for the General Teaching Council for Scotland dismissed her drink spiking claim as “speculation”. She was judged unfit to teach and barred from the profession. Carla Roth, presenting the case for the GTCS, told the panel there was a “public nature” to Graham’s actions on the night in June 2014 since they happened around pupils and the photo was shared on social media. She said the incident had left pupils “uncomfortable” and “somewhat shocked” and added: “You would have to question what sort of role model was provided in this instance.” Turning to the teacher’s claim that her drink had been spiked, Ms Roth described it as “essentially no more than a speculation”. She added: “We simply have no evidence of exactly why she may have had a memory loss.” Mrs Roth said Graham was “only willing to consider one version of events”, that her drink had been spiked, rather than that she had drunk too much. The lawyer added: “She cannot be said to have shown any insight into her conduct.” A police investigation was also launched after the photo emerged but the case was not brought to court because of a lack of evidence. Detective Sergeant Keith Mailer, who was part of the probe, described CCTV which showed Graham and the student kissing. He said: “Throughout the footage there’s no sign that Mrs Graham is under the excessive influence of drugs or alcohol.” He added: “The way she moved and conducted herself suggested someone who was making conscious decisions.” The SASRA is a highly respected organisation which has the Queen as its patron and former Army chief General Lord Dannatt as president. Its website says: “Our mission is one of personal evangelism. “Uniquely we are permitted, subject to Chaplain’s permission and Commanding Officers’ permission, to visit soldiers and airmen in their accommodation work and recreation areas. “This is done with a view to befriending them and introducing them to the Lord Jesus Christ.” A West Lothian Council spokesperson said: “Ms Graham is no longer employed by West Lothian Council and it would not be appropriate to comment further.” SHAMED Isabelle is the latest professional to throw away her career by bedding a pupil. Aberdeen-born maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, was jailed for 5½years in 2013 after fleeing to France with his 15-year-old schoolgirl lover. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, who taught English at St Joseph’s College, Dumfries, romped with pupil Matthew Robinson, 17, losing her marriage and career. And mum-of-three Bernadette Smith, 36, a history teacher at Stirling’s Bannockburn High, was struck off for stripping down to her bra and jeans and kissing a boy of 16 on his bed. Educational psychologist Dr Jack Boyle tells ANNA GAULT why teachers and pupils move their relationship out of the class and into bedroom. BOOZE and spur-of-the-moment recklessness can see a teacher risk everything to romp with a pupil, according to Dr Boyle. He said: “The vast majority of teachers are not the slightest bit interested in their pupils sexually. “In this day and age, the risks and penalties for acting on this are enormous — particularly for a teacher as people expect more and they are held to a high standard. “It’s very rare and there is no common thread to a relationship forming. “But sometimes alcohol is involved and of course alcohol will lower inhibitions — it devastatingly impairs judgments. “There is a high degree of impulsivity and recklessness on the part of the teacher. The consequences will ruin their life but because they are often acting on impulse they don’t think that far ahead. “By and large a teacher will indulge in this behaviour because they think they will get away with it.” PUPILS risk ridicule for getting in- olved with a teacher, Dr Boyle said. He went on: “Typically a 17-year-old boy would regard a 27-year-old woman as an older lady and would not be attracted to her. “Children are very conscious of age differences — for instance, a 14-year-old would not play with a 12-year-old. A boy getting involved with an older teacher would be mocked by his friends but, again, alcohol can be a factor. “Adolescent girls can often have a crush on one of their teachers but only a very small number moves into intimacy — and, of course, the teacher has to welcome it.” Dr Boyle said social media opened up more opportunities for teachers and their pupils to chat outside the classroom. He added: “A pupil is taking a risk to have a relationship with a teacher and immaturity is a factor.

The creation of this committee highlights the importance of both local and global support in ensuring the well-being and fair treatment of these individuals, who have become victims of their dedication to truth-telling and ambition to raise awareness of important issues affecting the nation and beyond. The genesis of the Support Committee for Detained Journalists in Laos stems from a shared concern regarding the unjust and often harrowing experiences that journalists face while carrying out their duties. Laos is ranked 167th out of the 180 countries listed in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index. With limited press freedom and a government that regularly restricts the dissemination of independent news, it comes as no surprise that journalists in the country face a heightened risk of detainment and mistreatment. The committee's main objectives include contributing to the emotional and physical wellbeing of the detained journalists by ensuring that their needs are met, raising awareness of their plight, and seeking legal and financial support for their cases. Members of the Support Committee, comprised of families and friends of the detained journalists, have gathered with a profound understanding of the emotional strain and devastation that the detainment of loved ones brings. Furthermore, the committee acknowledges the crucial role of international partners in advocating for these journalists. Organizations such as Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International boast invaluable experience and resources that can provide substantial aid in navigating the complex legal landscape and garnering public support for the detained journalists. The Support Committee for Detained Journalists endeavors to raise funds and secure legal expertise to assist the affected families in navigating the intricacies of their respective cases. They also aim to amplify the voices of these journalists by sharing their stories, challenges, and successes. By doing so, the committee hopes to inspire solidarity among local media professionals, as well as raise global awareness about the plight of journalists in Laos. Public advocacy efforts, such as petitions and collaborative events, will play a significant role in raising visibility for these detained journalists and their families. While the Support Committee works tirelessly to garner attention for their cause, they simultaneously emphasize the importance of respecting each journalist's right to privacy. Thus, they will strive to maintain a delicate balance between providing necessary support and safeguarding individual identity and safety. Education and the promotion of responsible journalism practices will be central to the Support Committee's goals. Engaging with relevant stakeholders, the committee will work to foster understanding and protection for journalistic activities. By doing so, they hope to contribute to a wider movement promoting press freedom and the protection of the rights of journalists in Laos and worldwide. As the Support Committee for Detained Journalists in Laos emerges to advocate for their respective families and friends, their efforts will represent the collective strength that arises when individuals unite for a single cause. By working in conjunction with global entities and local support networks, this committee underscores the unwavering determination that strives to uplift the human spirit and fortify those who bravely pursue truth, despite the risks involved."},{"instruction":"The government will examine claims 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since the US-led invasion, Jack Straw says.

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which parcel of land didn't have an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, we can infer that the parcel of land that did not have an excess of water percolating downward through the soil layers would be Bill's land, which was covered with grasslands. Allow me to elaborate on the reasoning behind this answer. The article states that in forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, leading to an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. As Tom's land was forested, the conditions for this process to occur were present, thus suggesting that excess water percolated through the soil layers in his parcel. Conversely, Bill's land was covered with grasslands, not forests. Grasslands typically have different characteristics in terms of precipitation and evapotranspiration dynamics compared to forests, resulting in a contrasting soil moisture regime. Grasslands generally exhibit a more balanced relationship between precipitation and evapotranspiration, depending on the specific climate and region in question. In these ecosystems, rainfall may be absorbed by the vegetation for growth and transpiration, leaving less water to percolate through the soil layers compared to the situation in forests. As a result, the excess of water percolating through the soil layers, which we see in forest ecosystems, might not be present in grasslands. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Bill's grassland-covered parcel of land did not have an excess of water percolating downward through the soil layers, while Tom's forested land did. However, it should be noted that this conclusion is derived from the information given in the background article, and real-world observations may vary depending on numerous other factors such as regional climate, soil composition, and specific local ecologies."},{"instruction":"Here is one sentence: To raise Sandy Hook light. Here is another sentence: Raise your hands. Does the term raise mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"Step 1: Read and understand both sentences In the first sentence: \\"To raise Sandy Hook light.\\" In the second sentence: \\"Raise your hands.\\" Step 2: Identify the context and meaning of the term \\"raise\\" in both sentences In the first sentence, \\"raise\\" is used to indicate the increasing of Sandy Hook light, possibly referring to increasing the intensity or height of a lighthouse's light. In this context, it generally means to elevate, lift, or enhance something. In the second sentence, \\"raise\\" is used as a directive for someone to lift their hands up, commonly understood as a gesture or action. In this context, it means to physically lift something (hands) upward. Step 3: Compare the meaning of \\"raise\\" in both sentences Although the term \\"raise\\" is used to indicate some form of elevation or lifting in both sentences, the context and specific meanings are different. In the first sentence, it refers to increasing the intensity or height of a light, while in the second sentence it refers to physically lifting up one's hands.

Premise: \\"How the devil did they expect the slaves to put in sixteen hours of work without some kind of food?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"They expected the slaves to work for sixteen hours without food.\\"? Pick from: (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"How the devil did they expect the slaves to put in sixteen hours of work without some kind of food?,\\" we can infer a certain amount of information regarding the hypothesis \\"They expected the slaves to work for sixteen hours without food.\\" The premise is a rhetorical question that suggests the impossibility of expecting slaves to work for sixteen hours without providing them with any sustenance. It is essentially stating that it is unreasonable and inhumane to demand such a feat from them. This premise is not explicitly confirming or denying the hypothesis, but it certainly expresses doubt and disbelief in the idea. If we analyze both the premise and the hypothesis, the underlying question is: Did they (the people in authority) truly expect the slaves to work for sixteen hours without receiving any food? The hypothesis claims that the expectation was indeed for the slaves to work without food for the given time frame. Taking the tone and implication of the premise into account, we can infer that the narrator believes the situation to be unreasonable and basically impossible. It can be understood that the narrator is questioning this expectation and arguing for the logic of providing sustenance for the slaves. Given this analysis, the best answer to the question of whether the premise entails the hypothesis would be (III) no. The premise does not directly confirm the hypothesis, but instead, raises doubts and questions the logic behind the expectations. By doing so, the premise challenges the hypothesis with a rhetorical question to highlight the apparent absurdity of the situation presented. This suggests that the narrator does not believe the expectation to be valid or realistic."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a short story of five sentences written in natural language.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Engineers built a bridge in the class room\\" - Sentence B: \\"Engineers built a bridge over a river\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze both sentences and their meanings step by step. Sentence A: \\"Engineers built a bridge in the classroom.\\" 1. Engineers are professionals who design, build and maintain structures and systems. 2. Bridges are constructions that span and provide passage over an obstacle. 3. Classrooms are designated educational spaces, typically indoors and of limited size, where teaching and learning activities take place. 4. Considering the purpose, size and context of the classroom, it is highly unlikely and impractical for engineers to build a bridge within it. Sentence B: \\"Engineers built a bridge over a river.\\" 1. As mentioned before, engineers are professionals who build structures. 2. The purpose of a bridge is to provide passage over an obstacle. 3. Rivers are natural watercourses that are common obstacles that bridges are built over. 4. Therefore, it makes logical sense for engineers to build a bridge over a river. Based on this analysis, Sentence A is nonsensical, as it suggests an impractical and unlikely scenario where engineers construct a bridge in a confined space like a classroom, which has no purpose or need for a bridge. On the other hand, Sentence B is a logical and common scenario."},{"instruction":"Select from the following. -part shark himself -swimming with the fishes -a risk taker Q: Lee saw sharks in the water but jumped in anyways without skipping a beat.

Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"- no Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Crohn's disease is a complex, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the digestive tract. Medical professionals believe that it is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. 2. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and address various physical, mental, and emotional conditions. 3. Although acupuncture has been reported to provide symptomatic relief in some cases of IBD, it cannot be considered a cure for Crohn's disease. A cure would entail a complete and permanent resolution of the symptoms and underlying issues, which has not been definitively proven in the case of acupuncture. 4. Furthermore, the effectiveness of acupuncture in managing Crohn's disease symptoms is still a subject of debate within the scientific and medical communities. While some studies have suggested that acupuncture could have a positive effect on IBD patients, it is not universally accepted as a reliable method for treating Crohn's disease. 5. In conclusion, based on our understanding of Crohn's disease and acupuncture, it is not accurate to claim that acupuncture is a cure for the disease. While it may offer some symptom relief and potential benefits for some individuals, it does not address the root cause of the condition and does not promise a permanent elimination of the disease."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to the decreased amount of oxygen in the bloodstream resulting from respiratory insufficiency is called??","output":"The decreased amount of oxygen in the bloodstream resulting from respiratory insufficiency is called hypoxemia. Hypoxemia is a condition characterized by low levels of oxygen in the arterial blood, which can lead to reduced oxygen supply to the body's tissues and organs. This may ultimately impair their normal functioning and lead to various health complications. Respiratory insufficiency is the inability of the respiratory system to maintain proper oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream, which may be caused by several factors such as lung diseases, respiratory muscle weakness, airway obstruction, or other underlying health conditions. This insufficiency can lead to hypoxemia, which manifests as a decrease in the arterial blood's oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), alongside oxygen saturation (SaO2) below the normal range. There are several factors that contribute to the development of hypoxemia due to respiratory insufficiency, including: 1. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch: This occurs when the lungs receive an unequal distribution of air and blood, leading to areas in the lungs with poor gas exchange. In these areas, the oxygen supply might be lower than what the blood requires. 2. Shunt: A shunt is a physiological condition wherein blood bypasses the alveoli (tiny sacs where gas exchange happens within the lungs) and returns to the heart without being oxygenated. This can also occur due to abnormal blood vessels or cardiovascular malformations, further reducing blood oxygenation. 3. Diffusion impairment: This happens when the passage of oxygen molecules through the alveolar-capillary membrane is disrupted, like in cases of lung fibrosis or tissue damage. The thickening of the membrane prevents the efficient transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. 4. Hypoventilation: A reduction in alveolar ventilation (breathing) can lead to lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream. This can be a result of various factors, including respiratory muscle weakness, lung disease, or central nervous system disorders affecting the respiratory drive. 5. High altitude: At high altitudes, the air pressure and oxygen concentration in the atmosphere decrease, making it more difficult for the respiratory system to provide the necessary amount of oxygen to sustain normal body function. If the body does not adapt well to these changes, hypoxemia may develop. Symptoms of hypoxemia may vary, ranging from mild to severe, depending on the severity of oxygen depletion in the blood. Common signs and symptoms include: 1. Shortness of breath 2. Rapid or irregular heartbeat 3. Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin, particularly on the lips and fingertips) 4. Fatigue 5. Confusion, dizziness, or lightheadedness 6. Headache 7. Chest pain or discomfort It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional if experiencing these symptoms, as prompt diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications resulting from prolonged hypoxemia. Treatment for hypoxemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause of respiratory insufficiency, providing supplemental oxygen, or in severe cases, mechanical ventilation to support the respiratory system."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"114th Street marks the southern boundary of Columbia University’s Morningside Heights Campus and is the location of Butler Library, which is the University’s largest.\\", answer the following question.

Article: People do not analyze every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

They charge 3 per person for a pumpkin. The remaining pumpkins get turned into cans of pie filling, 3 pumpkins to a can. They grew 83 pumpkins this year and made 96 selling pumpkins for carving. How many cans of pie filling will the pumpkin patch produce? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the number of people who bought pumpkins for carving. Since they charge 3 per person for a pumpkin, we can find the number of people by dividing the total amount made by the cost per pumpkin: Number of people = Total amount / Cost per pumpkin Number of people = 96 / 3 Number of people = 32 Step 2: Calculate the number of pumpkins used for carving. We know that each person bought one pumpkin for carving, so 32 people bought 32 pumpkins in total. Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining pumpkins. We know that there were initially 83 pumpkins, so to find the number of remaining pumpkins, we subtract the number used for carving: Remaining pumpkins = Total pumpkins - Pumpkins used for carving Remaining pumpkins = 83 - 32 Remaining pumpkins = 51 Step 4: Calculate the number of cans of pie filling that can be produced. Since it takes 3 pumpkins to make a can of pie filling, we can find the number of cans by dividing the number of remaining pumpkins by the number of pumpkins required per can: Cans of pie filling = Remaining pumpkins / Pumpkins per can Cans of pie filling = 51 / 3 Cans of pie filling = 17 So, the pumpkin patch will produce 17 cans of pie filling."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Bloomberg News reported Thursday afternoon that AT&T and Time Warner executives have engaged in preliminary talks about a potential merger or other partnerships. Time Warner shares jumped on news of the talks, closing up 3.75, or 4.7%, to 82.99. The New York media company owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS and Hollywood’s largest film and TV studio, Warner Bros. Representatives of AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. Such a combination would transform AT&T, based in Dallas, into a communications and entertainment colossus with multiple distribution outlets — including one of the nation’s largest mobile phone networks — and some of the most prestigious television channels in the business. Warner Bros. also has a rich library of characters, including DC Comics and such cartoon characters as Scooby-Doo and the Looney Tunes zoo, including Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat. In some ways, AT&T-Time Warner would resemble cable giant Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal — but AT&T would be even bigger with its mobile phone operations. AT&T already operates the nation’s largest pay-TV service with more than 25 million customers. Like other telecommunications companies, AT&T has been eager to expand into the entertainment business as its mobile phone market matures. Owning content has become more valuable as more consumers, especially younger ones, watch entertainment on their phones. AT&T completed its 49-billion acquisition of DirecTV, based in El Segundo, in July 2015. Later this year the company plans to roll out a streaming service of TV channels to compete with traditional TV operators. AT&T has been working with an executive with considerable chops in Hollywood, former News Corp. President Peter Chernin, who now runs his own entertainment company. He and AT&T have partnered on several ventures, including Otter Media, suggesting that Chernin might play a role in the talks with Time Warner. Such a massive merger, however, would probably trigger significant antitrust concerns. It would come during a changing of the guard in Washington and it’s unclear whether regulators within a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration would consent to such a dramatic consolidation. The discussions come two years after Time Warner warded off a hostile takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch and his sons at 21st Century Fox. That deal valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion, but it collapsed amid resistance from Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes and Time Warner’s board. In addition, Fox investors got nervous about the acquisition, sending its shares down. Time Warner is currently valued at 65 billion. AT&T’s market capitalization is 238 billion. Time Warner, in recent years, has accelerated its push into digital media, launching HBO Now nearly 18 months ago. This summer, Time Warner took a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu, which is owned by NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney. AT&T shares closed down 73 cents, or 1.8%, to 38.65 in Thursday trading.

This article was first published at 2:35 p.m. ||||| (Reuters) - Senior executives of telecommunications company AT&T; Inc (T.N) and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc TWX.N have discussed various business strategies including a possible merger in recent weeks, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter. An AT&T; Logo is pictured on the side of a building in Pasadena, California, January 26, 2015. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni A deal would be one of the largest in recent years in the sector as telecom companies make a land grab for media firms in order to get hold of valuable content. Time Warner shares jumped 4.7 percent in regular trading and slightly extended gains after hours. AT&T; shares slipped 1.8 percent. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, Bloomberg said. (bloom.bg/2enqBF9) AT&T; and Time Warner declined to comment. Time Warner is attractive because of its premium cable channel HBO, the CNN news network, film studio Warner Bros and other media assets. AT&T;, which sells wireless phone and broadband services, may be looking to emulate cable company Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), which acquired NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation in a bid to become a massive force that controls how television shows and movies are made and how they are delivered to viewers. Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies more leverage as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or are cutting the cord altogether and watching online. AT&T; has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse, buying satellite TV provider DIRECTV last year for 48.5 billion. Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes has not been willing to sell in the past. The company rejected an 80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014. While Bewkes, 64, was not open to a deal two years ago, the pace of consolidation in the media sector may urge him to reconsider, especially as two competitors, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) have been exploring a potential merger at the request of controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone. Talk of a deal comes as another potential bidder, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is busy with its purchase of internet company Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, which has been set back by news of a massive hacking breach into Yahoo customers’ email accounts. Time Warner has a market value of about 65 billion. AT&T; has a market value of about 238 billion. Any merger of that size in a sensitive market would get a close look from regulators, analysts said, but that would not necessarily derail a deal. “Whoever the next president’s pick for the Federal Communications Commission is will have a significant say,” said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. Entner said Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal set a precedent and there is “a strong argument to say the FCC should approve” a deal between AT&T; and Time Warner. ||||| LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:43 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Senior executives at AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. have met in recent weeks to discuss various business strategies including a possible merger, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks, which at this stage are informal, have focused on building relations between the companies rather than establishing the terms of a specific transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, the people said. Acquiring Time Warner would give AT&T, one of the biggest providers of pay-TV and of wireless and home internet service in the U.S., a collection of popular programming to offer to subscribers, from HBO to NBA basketball to the Cartoon Network. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has been looking to add more content and original programming as part of his plan to transform the Dallas-based telecommunications company into a media and entertainment giant. “There’s a lot that’s attractive about Time Warner,” media industry veteran Peter Chernin, who runs an online video joint venture with AT&T, said in an interview Thursday on CNBC. “I think they’re both great companies.” He said he didn’t know anything about a deal. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes is a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair, said one of the people. Bewkes and his board rejected an 85-a-share approach in 2014 from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc., which valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion. For a Gadfly take on AT&T’s media ambitions, click here Time Warner rose 4.7 percent to 82.99, valuing the company at about 64.5 billion. AT&T fell 1.9 percent to 38.65. Representatives for AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. Telecom Powerhouse Time Warner shares had gained about 23 percent this year through Wednesday, boosted by sales gains at both its HBO premium channel and Turner cable-TV unit. AT&T is up 12 percent in 2016, valuing the Dallas-based company at about 238 billion. AT&T has transformed itself over the last decade from a regional phone company to a national telecommunications powerhouse. Its plan to focus on media and entertainment targets include companies worth 2 billion to 50 billion, people familiar with the plans said earlier this month. Last year, AT&T paid 48.5 billion to acquire satellite-TV provider DirecTV, its biggest deal in at least 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T has been developing an internet-based version of the pay-TV service, called DirecTV Now. “With the pending launch of the DirecTV Now OTT app, it might make sense to move onto content ownership, but Time-Warner is an awfully big first step into the content world,” said John Butler, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in an e-mail. The results are mixed with blockbuster deals that bring outsiders into the media industry. Comcast Corp. has had a largely successful run since acquiring control of NBCUniversal in 2009. But Time Warner itself had one of the most disastrous mergers of all time when it combined with America Online Inc. in 2000. With 7.2 billion of cash on hand, AT&T doesn’t have enough firepower to make a big deal with cash alone. In the wake of the DirecTV purchase and the 18 billion it spent in the federal airwave auction last year, AT&T’s net debt was 120 billion at the end of June. Moody’s Investors Service calculates the company’s adjusted leverage at 3.1 times earnings and says the company’s rating, three levels above junk, could be downgraded if it doesn’t stay on track to fall below 3 times. — With assistance by Lucas Shaw, Gerry Smith, and Scott Moritz ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Telecoms company, AT&T Inc and media conglomerate, Time Warner, have reportedly been engaging in preliminary discussions regarding a possible merger or partnership.

The Progress M-27M was launched yesterday and was scheduled to dock at the International Space Station six hours later to deliver 2.5 tons of supplies, including food and fuel. But flight controllers were unable to receive data from the spacecraft, which had entered the wrong orbit. Mission Control spokesman Sergei Talalasov told the Interfax news agency today that flight controllers were still trying to restore communication with the Progress. \\"It has started descending. It has nowhere else to go,\\" another official tells AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \\"It is clear that absolutely uncontrollable reactions have begun.\\" Russia's space agency and NASA both said the six crew members on board the orbiting space station have sufficient supplies and are in no danger.

Notable examples are Walt Disney's Fantasia, Tom and Jerry's Johann Mouse, and Warner Bros.' Rabbit of Seville and What's Opera, Doc?.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"\\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" is a critically acclaimed animated short film produced by Warner Bros.' animation team in 1957. It was directed by Chuck Jones, written by Michael Maltese, and featured the iconic characters Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. This masterpiece beautifully integrates classical music and operatic elements into the storyline, making it a highly influential piece in the history of animated films. The short's inspiration comes from Richard Wagner's famous four-opera cycle titled \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen,\\" or \\"The Ring of the Nibelung\\". By incorporating the wondrous music of Wagner, the animation team elevates a classic Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd rivalry to the level of epic opera. The plot of \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" essentially parodies various operatic conventions, creating a highly entertaining spectacle while also paying homage to the original source material. The story starts with Elmer Fudd, dressed as the heroic character \\"Siegfried\\" from Wagner's \\"Ring\\" cycle, vowing to kill the seemingly monstrous rabbit, Bugs Bunny. The opera's distinctive music creates an engaging atmosphere as the characters relentlessly pursue each other, ultimately leading to a tragic ending. The use of classical music in \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" is evident in several iconic scenes. One notable example is the use of \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" from Wagner's \\"Die Walküre,\\" when Elmer Fudd summons a storm to lure Bugs into his trap. Another is the beautiful \\"Pilgrim's Chorus\\" from \\"Tannhäuser,\\" which serves as the backdrop to an emotional climax in the story. In addition to the superb use of music, the animation in \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" also showcases an outstanding level of artistry. The visual design incorporates stylized backgrounds and well-crafted character design, with a bold color palette that captures the grandeur of great operatic productions. \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" has gone on to become one of the most celebrated works of the Golden Age of Animation. With its seamless melding of classical music and clever storytelling, it captured the imagination of audiences and demonstrated the potential of animation as an art form. In 1992, the Library of Congress selected the short for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" - an honor that was bestowed on very few animated works. The popularity and influence of \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" can also be seen in the aforementioned animations such as Disney's \\"Fantasia\\" and other Warner Bros. projects like \\"Rabbit of Seville.\\" These animated works, alongside \\"What's Opera, Doc?,\\" showcased classical music and the quality of animation at the time, elevating the art form while entertaining millions of viewers. In summary, \\"What's Opera, Doc?\\" is a remarkable animated short that masterfully blends music from Richard Wagner's operas with the charisma of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, creating a unique and memorable experience. Its impact on pop culture and animated films has been monumental and will continue to be recognized and celebrated for its artistry and creativity."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the area where an electron is most likely to be found called?

So how did England's players fare overall? Chief football writer Phil McNulty runs the rule over those on duty. Barely in action. Has had plenty of quiet matches in this Euro 2016 campaign - might have been a night for Jack Butland to get a taste of the action. Had plenty of time to get forward and deliver some crosses but actually had a fairly quiet game. Barely needed defensively. Useful outing for the Southampton defender but very much down the pecking order of England left-backs. Competent. Not much to do but elegant on the ball and one excellent clearance that could easily have been an own goal with poor technique. Solid in defence but once again a night where he was never fully tested by an average Estonia side. Tireless as ever but restricted by his role as a holding midfield player. Hodgson's Mr Reliable. A dazzling, unpredictable talent. Still has flaws in decision-making but a real England game-changer and superb pass for Theo Walcott's goal. Busy without making a serious impact on the game. Did not do enough to suggest he will be a starter when it matters. Good night for the Arsenal striker as he got on the scoresheet. An increasingly reliable performer and offers England pace and adaptability. Quiet night for the Spurs striker but has proved before he can get goals for England. Good performance. Busy and showed real pace. Good for his confidence to get on the scoresheet with a simple late finish. Very quiet cameo. No rating but on long enough to set Sterling's goal up with a very unselfish pass. A pointless substitution on Alli's debut.

Jeremy Hunt said it was time to end the \\"historic imbalance\\" between mental and physical health services. But Labour says the plans \\"offer little hope\\" to those already in the sector, \\"promising only jam tomorrow, when what is needed is action today\\". The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England will fund the scheme. Ministers in England have previously acknowledged that the treatment offered to patients with mental health problems suffers in comparison with those with physical ailments. In 2016, the government committed Â£1.3bn to transform mental health services in England, with a pledge to treat an extra one million patients by 2020-21. These plans set out how some of that money will be spent - mostly on recruiting staff, with the main focus being on child and adolescent mental health services, therapists delivering talking therapies for adults and nurses working in crisis care. The plans also include improving staff training, encouraging those who have left the profession to return, and addressing a high dropout rate among trainees. However, data published last week showed that even before this latest recruitment drive, many thousands of nursing posts remain unfilled. The current plans include: Mr Hunt said: \\"We want people with mental health conditions to receive better treatment, and part of that means having the right NHS staff. \\"We know we need to do much more to attract, retain and support the mental health workforce of the future - today is the first step to address this historic imbalance in workforce planning.\\" Mr Hunt said the measures were \\"ambitious\\" and amounted to \\"one of the biggest expansions of mental health services in Europe\\". However, Labour's shadow minister for mental health, Barbara Keeley, said the government was \\"promising only jam tomorrow, when what is needed is action today\\". \\"The workforce plan provides no real answers on how these new posts will be funded or how recruitment issues will be overcome,\\" she added. \\"And it offers little hope to those working in the sector faced with mounting workloads, low pay and poor morale.\\" Claire Murdoch, national mental health director at NHS England, said the plan was not just about numbers. \\"It's about having a motivated and skilled workforce in place to deliver the work we need to do.\\" Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said 570 extra consultants had been promised in the plans. \\"You would expect to see a consultant if you had cancer and the same applies for mental health. \\"The biggest challenge to creating robust mental health services is the workforce. I am very supportive of this strategy which starts to tackle that problem.\\" But Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said the government's plans did not add up. \\"There is already a dangerous lack of workforce planning and accountability and this report is unable to provide detail on how the ambitions will be met. \\"It is clear the government will need to work hard just to get back to the number of specialist staff working in mental health services in 2010. \\"Under this government, there are 5,000 fewer mental health nurses and that goes some way to explaining why patients are being failed.\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about the government's plans to improve mental health services by increasing the number of trained nurses, therapists, and mental health professionals.

Stevenson (Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from the U.S., Chile and New Zealand has uncovered evidence that contradicts the conventional view of the demographic collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team describes how they conducted obsidian hydration dating of artifacts from the island to trace the history of human activity in the area and what they found in doing so. For many years, Earth scientists and others have used Easter Island and its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, as a lesson in what can happen when a parcel of land is overpopulated and thus overused—resources diminish and the people starve to death (or resort to cannibalism as some have suggested). But now, the researchers with this new effort suggest that thinking may be wrong. Scientists believe Polynesians first settled on Easter Island sometime around 1200 AD—over the course of the next several hundred years the settlers became the Rapa Nui, famous for the massive maoi statues that were erected. Over that time period, the people cut down most of the trees on the northern part of the island and a lot of the other vegetation. That led to the loss of nutrient rich topsoil due to erosion and the idea that the people began to starve to death. To better understand what actually occurred both before and after Europeans arrived in the 1700's, the researchers used a technique known as obsidian hydration dating on artifacts found at various sites on the northern part of the island where the Rapa Nui lived. That allowed them to gain insights into how the land in that area had been used during different time periods. From that they were able to construct a timeline that showed where the people were living over the course of hundreds of years. And that, the researchers report, showed that rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns. Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards. The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery. This means, the team concludes, that there is little evidence of population collapse prior to European contact.

Stevenson, PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1420712112 Abstract Many researchers believe that prehistoric Rapa Nui society collapsed because of centuries of unchecked population growth within a fragile environment. Recently, the notion of societal collapse has been questioned with the suggestion that extreme societal and demographic change occurred only after European contact in AD 1722. Establishing the veracity of demographic dynamics has been hindered by the lack of empirical evidence and the inability to establish a precise chronological framework. We use chronometric dates from hydrated obsidian artifacts recovered from habitation sites in regional study areas to evaluate regional land-use within Rapa Nui. The analysis suggests region-specific dynamics including precontact land use decline in some near-coastal and upland areas and postcontact increases and subsequent declines in other coastal locations. These temporal land-use patterns correlate with rainfall variation and soil quality, with poorer environmental locations declining earlier. This analysis confirms that the intensity of land use decreased substantially in some areas of the island before European contact. ||||| The downfall of Easter Island may have had more to do with preexisting environmental conditions than degradation by humans, according to a new study of the remote speck of land made famous by its enormous stone-head statues. Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, was first settled around A.D. 1200, and Europeans landed on its shores in 1722. The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the indigenous population of Rapa Nui are hotly debated both in academia and popular culture. Scientist and author Jared Diamond argued in his 2005 book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" (Viking Press) that prior to European contact, the indigenous people of the island degraded the environment to the extent that they could no longer thrive. The new study suggests that Easter Island's people were, indeed, suffering before Europeans came along. The story of their downfall, however, may be less about environmental degradation than the pre-existing environmental constraints of the 63-square-mile (163 square kilometers) isle. [Image Gallery: The Walking Statues of Easter Island] \\"The results of our research were really quite surprising to me,\\" said study co-author Thegn Ladefoged, an anthropologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \\"Indeed, in the past, we've published articles about how there was little evidence for pre-European-contact societal collapse.\\" Collapse of civilization? The new study challenged Ladefoged and his colleagues' view. Changes on Easter Island have been well documented, archaeologically. Over time, elite dwellings were destroyed, inland agricultural fields were abandoned, and people took refuge in caves and began manufacturing more and more spear points made out of volcanic glass called obsidian, perhaps suggesting a period of war and upheaval. The problem with pinning down the island's history, according to the researchers, is that the dates of all these events and abandonments remain murky. Going into the study, the researchers expected to find that most of the disaster occurred after Europeans arrived, Ladefoged told Live Science. To clarify the timeline, the researchers analyzed more than 400 obsidian tools and chipped-off obsidian flakes from six sites scattered around the island, focusing in particular on three with good information on climate and soil chemistry. Obsidian absorbs water when exposed to air. By measuring the amount of water absorption in the surfaces of the obsidian tools and flakes, the research team was able to gauge how long those surfaces have been exposed, thus revealing when the tools were made. A greater number of tools from a certain time period indicates heavier human use of that area during that time. [History's 10 Most Overlooked Mysteries] Natural challenges The obsidian dates varied widely across the sites. Site 1, on the northwestern coast of the island, saw a steady increase in use between about 1220 and 1650, with a fast decline starting after 1650 — long before Europeans arrived on the island. Site 2, an interior mountainside site, saw a rapid increase in land use between about 1200 and 1300, a slower increase until about 1480, and then constant use until a decline that started between 1705 and 1710, also before European contact. By the time Europeans came along, coastal Site 1 was at about 54 percent of its peak land use, and mountainous Site 2 was at only about 60 percent. Site 3 told a different story. This near-coastal area saw a slow increase in human activity between 1250 and 1500, and then a faster increase until about 1690, after which settlement remained fairly constant until after European contact. In fact, the decline in use of this site didn't begin until 1850 or later, the researchers found. The differing climates of the sites may explain the uneven decline, the researchers said. Site 1 is in the rain shadow of the volcano Ma'unga Terevaka, making it prone to droughts. Site 2 is wetter, but its soil fertility is low. Site 3, the longest-lasting spot, is both rainy and fertile. What this means is that the people of Easter Island may have been struggling against natural environmental barriers to success, rather than degrading the environment themselves, the researchers reported Monday (Jan. 5) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"It is clear that people were reacting to regional environmental variation on the island before they were devastated by the introduction of European diseases and other historic processes,\\" Ladefoged said. The next step, he said, would be to take a detailed look at the archaeological remnants of dwellings on the island over time to better understand how humans and the environment interacted.

(Gregory Boissy/AFP/Getty Images) In 1722, Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen was in the middle of a bad career move. The year before, at 62, the successful notary and Dutch East India Company employee had ditched it all to follow his father’s dream of discovering Terra Australis, a mythical continent in the Southern Hemisphere thought to be as large as the vast land masses that crowded the Northern Hemisphere. The problem: Terra Australis didn’t exist. Sure, Australia and Antarctica are down under somewhere, but these measly continents are nowhere near large enough to balance out the great expanses of terra firma north of the Equator, an equilibrium thought necessary by Age of Exploration theorists. So Roggeveen — a bit of a Don Quixote on a fool’s errand — wandered about the seas. He rounded Cape Horn. He battled ice and bad weather up the coast of Chile. Then he turned left into the great, largely empty unknown. And on Easter Sunday, he made his most significant discovery: a land mass of about 60 square miles notable for its giant statues and lack of large trees that he named Easter Island, now called Rapa Nui. He stayed for a week. His crew killed some Rapa Nui locals. And then he split, sailing northwest into obscurity. Not long after this first encounter between the Old World and the New, Easter Island’s population began to decline. Some scholars blamed a dwindling food supply resulting from Rapa Nui residents’ abuse of the environment. Others blamed Europeans. Did the meandering Dutch notary discover a remote civilization later undone by invaders, or was it already on the brink of collapse? A new paper provides evidence that, for the Rapa Nui, depleted resources were not a problem — leaving Europeans as a possible culprit. “Our paper evaluates a long-standing debate and examines whether the prehistoric population of Rapa Nui experienced a significant demographic collapse prior to European contact,” researchers led by Christopher M. Stevenson of Virginia Commonwealth University wrote. “… This analysis demonstrates that the concept of ‘collapse’ is a misleading characterization of prehistoric human population dynamics.” The so-called collapse of Rapa Nui’s food supply, which resulted in starvation and cannibalism, is a long-held theory and, on occasion, a parable for the dangers of abusing the environment. After coming to the island in about 1200 A.D., the story goes, Polynesian settlers stripped it bare of trees, eroding nutrient-rich topsoil. Jared Diamond presented this case in his book “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.” “They had the misfortune to be living in one of the most fragile environments, at the highest risk of deforestation, of any specific people,” he wrote. “… Easter’s isolation makes it the clearest example of a society that destroyed itself by overexploiting its own resources.” Investigating this thesis for the study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers tried to figure out how people on Rapa Nui used their land — and whether they had enough to eat. Their technique: good old obsidian hydration dating, which allowed them to figure out when artifacts discovered in different parts of the island were used. Their conclusion: Yes, food production probably declined on Rapa Nui before Roggeveen’s arrival. But that wasn’t a disaster. “We propose that precontact declines in the intensity of land use (and presumably population) in dry and infertile regions of Rapa Nui better reflect a framework of environmental constraint than of environmental degradation,” they wrote. As Phys.org translated: “Rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns.” There’s no doubt that Rapa Nui was devastated not long after Roggeveen‘s visit. Its population was in the thousands when the Dutchman made landfall in 1722. By the time British navigator Captain James Cook arrived in 1774, it was about 700. The reason for the decline? The new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences did not speculate. But other writers pointed to sexually-transmitted disease — and slavery — brought to Rapa Nui by Europe. “Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards,” Phys.org noted. “The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A team of researchers from the U.S., Chile, and New Zealand has discovered evidence that contradicts the popular view of the collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact.

Ghitis: We are all not just witnesses; we are the protagonists of our own time.","output":"Title: The Power of Challenging the Status Quo: Edward Snowden and Pope Francis Introduction We live in a world of constant change, where various forces drive the transformation of societies at an unprecedented pace. Often, these forces are led by individuals who refuse to accept the status quo and are willing to take significant risks to challenge the powerful institutions they belong to. These courageous individuals make an immense impact on history by unveiling wrongdoings, questioning rigid traditions, and inspiring others to stand up for what is right. Perhaps two of the most notable figures in recent times to successfully challenge their respective domains are Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, and Pope Francis, the spiritual leader of the Catholic Church. In this article, we delve into the striking similarities and accomplishments of these two extraordinary individuals as highlighted by Frida Ghitis, an independent commentator on world affairs. Edward Snowden: Exposing the NSA's Massive Spying The revelations of mass surveillance programs by the United States government that Snowden exposed in 2013 shook the world and sparked massive debates on privacy, security, and the role of intelligence agencies in democratic societies. Frida Ghitis rightfully says that if not for Edward Snowden, we wouldn't know about the extent of the National Security Agency's (NSA) spying on innocent citizens through widespread snooping on phone and internet communications. Snowden's bold actions, though considered criminal by some, led to public pressure for governments worldwide to reconsider their mass surveillance practices. His actions ignited the awareness and willpower needed to advocate for necessary protections on individuals' privacy rights in the digital age. As a result, Snowden directly contributed to the reform of surveillance regulations and international discussions on privacy protection, while demonstrating how the powerful paradigm of state-controlled secrecy could be successfully challenged. Pope Francis: Challenging the Mighty Forces of Catholic Tradition On the other side of the spectrum lies Pope Francis, who assumed leadership of the Catholic Church in 2013. Although an established authority figure within the church, he has made considerable efforts to challenge and reform the mighty forces of Catholic tradition. As Ghitis highlights, Pope Francis represents a new and charismatic approach to making the church more inclusive, relatable, and sincerely compassionate. Under his leadership, Pope Francis has expressed progressive stances on controversial issues, ranging from the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community within the Catholic Church to the acknowledgement of the accelerating climate change that our planet faces. By openly discussing these topics and encouraging proactive conversations within the church's hierarchy, Pope Francis has portrayed an engaging and vulnerable leadership that significantly differs from his predecessors. Furthermore, his dedication to addressing scandals and abuses within the church has not only demonstrated his willingness to confront the darker side of the organization he leads but has also generated hope for transforming it from within into a more humble and accountable institution. Conclusion: We Are the Protagonists of Our Time The exemplary feats of Edward Snowden and Pope Francis serve as a stark reminder that we all possess the potential to create immense change if we choose to challenge the status quo. As Frida Ghitis emphasizes, we are not just witnesses but protagonists in our own time, capable of actively participating in shaping the course of history. Ordinary individuals often underestimate the transformative power that resides within them. Notwithstanding the differences in background, motivation, or outcomes, Snowden and Pope Francis offer us a valuable lesson that courage, determination, and a morally grounded vision can challenge even the most sturdy establishments, thus bringing forth fresh air and new opportunities for growth and evolution. By taking inspiration from their actions, we can gather the strength to be the change we wish to see in the world, and step up as the protagonists of our time."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In order to make students become more interested in English studies,21 elementary schools in southeastern Korea have started to use robot teachers.

If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait. Sanfilippo syndrome occurs when the substances (enzymes) needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective. There are 4 main types of Sanfilippo syndrome, also called MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected. ||||| Courtesy Glenn O’Neill The O’Neill family in Colombia, S.C., have placed themselves on self-quarantine for the past 160 days to protect sickly little girl Eliza. A South Carolina family has lived the past 160 days under self-quarantine and would know better than anyone the challenges facing Ebola medical workers under mandated quarantines. But Glenn O'Neill told the Daily News his family's situation was much different than the health care professionals returning home from West Africa, because the O'Neills can decide to leave their house whenever they want. Instead, they choose to stay away from other people as a precaution to protect the health of Glenn's 4-year-old daughter, Eliza, who has Sanfilippo syndrome. Children with the extremely rare disease typically start developing deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by age 5. Many of the victims are confined to a wheelchair as the disease starts to spread. Mandated Quarantines States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies madating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines. People placed under the mandates have resisted the protocols and medical experts have decried the regulations as unnecessary — though politicians say they're in the public's best interest.

She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday night, when she was allowed to serve her 21-day quarantine at her home in Maine. The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They do leave their house once every other week, but only to places they are sure there will not be any other people, such as a deserted beach or an open field. And the only time Glenn O'Neill has gone somewhere with people, he might have gotten arrested. He needed to go to a bank to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation. The 42-year-old was as cautious as he could be, informing the bank members ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything. As he pulled into the parking lot, he started to put on his protective mask and gloves — and scared a fellow motorist who spotted him. People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter how can you use that word? \\"He pulled back real slowly and had a look on his face like, 'what the heck?'\\" O'Neill said. \\"He thought I was going to rob the place. I called the bank and said 'I'm coming in with gloves and a mask. Just making sure there won't be any trouble.'\\" Making the Decision In May the children, Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Glenn's wife, Cara, left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Glenn now works from home as a purchasing consultant. \\"People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?\\" he said. Eliza, who turns 5 next month, is at a crucial stage at which simple colds and illnesses could accelerate her deterioration. The measure has worked. Eliza has not gotten sick and is doing as well as could reasonably be expected for the time being, Glenn said. Steven J.

Physical reasoning tasks can be both theoretical and practical, often requiring a person to analyze, predict, and manipulate the behavior of objects and systems in real-world or simulated environments. Here is a detailed example of a task that could test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning: Title: Design a small-scale Suspension Bridge Objective: Design and build a small-scale suspension bridge model using a limited number of materials that can effectively support a certain amount of weight. Task Breakdown: 1. Research and analyze existing suspension bridge designs. The individual should first study the physics concepts related to suspension bridges. They must understand the forces acting on the bridge, such as tension, compression, and torque, as well as how these forces interact with one another. The participant must familiarize themselves with real-life examples of suspension bridges and their characteristics to better visualize their task. 2. Conceptualize a design based on given constraints. After analyzing various suspension bridge designs, the individual should start sketching their ideas. They must consider the constraints provided, such as the dimensions of the bridge, the minimum weight it should support, and the limit on available materials. Their design should take into account how various components will distribute the weight while ensuring stability and strength. 3. Select appropriate materials. The individual should now decide on the best materials to use for their bridge. Material selection will depend not only on their properties but also on the constraints given. Factors such as strength, rigidity, elasticity, and durability should be considered. Common materials for a small-scale suspension bridge model may include paper, cardboard, straws, string, or wire. 4. Construct the bridge model. Using the chosen materials, the participant must proceed to build their small-scale suspension bridge model. They should follow their design closely, making adjustments as needed to maintain the stability and aesthetics of the structure. The individual must use their understanding of physical principles and material properties to optimize the bridge's ability to support the required weight. 5. Test the performance of the bridge. Lastly, the individual should test their bridge's weight-bearing capability. This can be done by gradually adding weights onto the bridge (e.g., small bags of sand, coins) to see if it can support the specified requirements. They must carefully evaluate the performance, stability, and durability of the model and note any structural issues or design flaws that arise during the testing process. Throughout the task, the individual must rely on their physical reasoning abilities to understand the forces and principles involved and apply them to their design. The success of their small-scale suspension bridge will be determined by the accuracy of their predictions and problem-solving regarding the behavior of the structure under various conditions."},{"instruction":"Math Problem Solve -1503*h + 79*h - 18759 = 55289 for h.","output":"Step 1: Combine like terms (h terms) on the left side of the equation. -1503*h + 79*h = (-1503 + 79) * h = -1424*h Now, the equation is -1424*h - 18759 = 55289.

Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure.

Regarded as the most important recording engineer of jazz by some observers, Van Gelder recorded several thousand jazz sessions, including many recognized as classics, in a career which spanned more than half a century. Van Gelder recorded many of the great names in the genre, including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, and Horace Silver, among many others. He worked with many record companies but was most closely associated with Blue Note Records. In 1967, Alfred Lion retired from running Blue Note, and the company's owners, Liberty Records (from 1965), began to use other engineers more regularly. Prestige, too, had started to use other studios a few years earlier. Van Gelder remained active in music recording, working as the engineer for most of Creed Taylor's CTI Records releases, a series of proto-smooth jazz albums that were financially successful, but not always well received by critics. Though his output slowed, Van Gelder remained active as a recording engineer into the new century. In the late 1990s he worked as a recording engineer for some of the songs featured on the soundtrack to the TV Show Cowboy Bebop. From 1999, he remastered the analog Blue Note recordings he made several decades earlier into 24-bit digital recordings in its RVG Edition series and also a similar series of remasters of some of the Prestige albums he recorded for its current owners, Concord Records. He was positive about the switch from analog to digital technology. He told Audio magazine in 1995: The biggest distorter is the LP itself. I've made thousands of LP masters. I used to make 17 a day, with two lathes going simultaneously, and I'm glad to see the LP go. As far as I'm concerned, good riddance. It was a constant battle to try to make that music sound the way it should. It was never any good. And if people don't like what they hear in digital, they should blame the engineer who did it. Blame the mastering house. Blame the mixing engineer. That's why some digital recordings sound terrible, and I'm not denying that they do, but don't blame the medium.

A. celebration B. deflation C. recession D. spend more E. problems The best answer is","output":"E. Problems The European Central Bank (ECB) is the institution that sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, which consists of countries that have adopted the euro as their national currency. A key part of its mandate is to maintain price stability, which it defines as keeping inflation rates close to, but below, 2% over the medium term. However, a focus on fighting inflation without concern for other issues can cause a variety of problems. While it is true that high inflation can erode savings, hinder economic growth, and create uncertainty, a singular focus on inflation can lead to suboptimal outcomes when other important economic factors are not taken into account. Some of these problems include: 1. Neglecting economic growth: By focusing solely on inflation, the ECB may fail to give adequate consideration to the importance of promoting economic growth and reducing unemployment. In situations where inflation is low but economic growth is slow or even negative, this one-dimensional focus on inflation can exacerbate economic stagnation. 2. Overlooking other causes of inflation: Focusing on controlling inflation could lead the ECB to overlook other factors that can contribute to inflation, such as supply side shocks (e.g., disruptions in oil or food prices) or inflation expectations. These factors may require different policy responses than a broad focus on lowering inflation would suggest. 3. Ignoring financial stability: In the pursuit of low inflation, the ECB may overlook the need to ensure financial stability. For example, it may set interest rates too low for too long, leading to excessive risk-taking and the buildup of asset price bubbles, which could ultimately result in financial crises. 4. Monetary policy transmission mechanism: By focusing exclusively on fighting inflation, the ECB may miss the varying effectiveness of its monetary policy across different euro area countries. This could lead to diverging economic growth and inflation rates among the Eurozone countries, potentially increasing inequality within the economic bloc. 5. Political consequences: A narrow focus on inflation can lead to public dissatisfaction with the ECB's policies, especially during times of economic hardship. If citizens feel that the ECB is more concerned with controlling inflation rather than promoting overall economic well-being, it can erode the institution's credibility and public support. In conclusion, while maintaining price stability is an essential aspect of the ECB's mandate, focusing solely on fighting inflation without concern for other issues can create problems. A more comprehensive approach to monetary policy, one that considers other factors such as economic growth, financial stability, and the broader well-being of the euro area, is needed to ensure a more sustainable and inclusive economic future for the Eurozone."},{"instruction":"IOC reportedly strips Armstrong of Olympic medal LONDON – The IOC has stripped Lance Armstrong of his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics because of his involvement in doping, officials familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Thursday. Two officials said the IOC sent a letter to Armstrong on Wednesday night asking him to return the medal. The move came after the International Olympic Committee was notified by cycling's governing body that Armstrong had not appealed the decision to disqualify him. The officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the decision hasn't been announced. The IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal. Now that the deadline has expired, the IOC decided to take the medal away. The letter to Armstrong also was sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee. The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs -- after years of denials -- is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The timing of the IOC move, however, was not related to the TV interview. Two months after winning his second Tour de France title in 2000, Armstrong took bronze in Sydney in the road time trial behind winner and U.S. Postal Service teammate Vyacheslav Ekimov of Russia and Jan Ullrich of Germany. The IOC opened a disciplinary case in November after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread doping by Armstrong and his teammates. The report called it the most sophisticated doping program in sports. The IOC will not reallocate Armstrong's bronze medal, just as the UCI decided not to declare any winners for the Tour titles once held by the Texan. Spanish rider Abraham Olano Manzano, who finished fourth in Sydney, will not be upgraded and the bronze medal placing will be left vacant in Olympic records. In August, the IOC stripped Tyler Hamilton, a former Armstrong teammate, of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Athens Olympics after he admitted to doping. In that case, Ekimov was upgraded to gold. The IOC also is investigating Levi Leipheimer, a former Armstrong teammate who won the time-trial bronze at the 2008 Beijing Games. The American confessed to doping as part of his testimony against Armstrong in the USADA case. The IOC is looking into the details of Leipheimer's admitted doping, including when the cheating took place, before moving to strip his medal. Finishing fourth behind Leipheimer in 2008 was Alberto Contador, the Spaniard who was stripped of the 2010 Tour de France title after testing positive for clenbuterol. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reportedly stripped Lance Armstrong of his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics due to his involvement in doping. Armstrong had not appealed the decision to disqualify him and was asked to return the medal.

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.

But late Friday afternoon, while talking about Karlijn Keijzer (pronounced Kar-line Kite-ser)–a former Indiana University rower who was killed on Malaysia Airlines Fight 17 on Thursday–Peterson reached his breaking point. She was 25. “One of my favorite memories that keeps popping into my head, and it makes me so sad to say this,” Peterson says, unable to continue his words. Between several pauses to let the tears pass, he explains why he can no longer hide his grief. It was such a small thing, really, but it meant so much. After every season, Peterson conducts exit interviews with his athletes. Keijzer was from the Netherlands, and under NCAA rules was eligible to row only one year while she pursued her graduate studies in chemistry. Keijzer was a key recruit for Peterson, who was looking to draw more international athletes, with more experience, to help keep Indiana competitive in the Big Ten. Keijzer was a terrific fit. She had competed in prestigious events, like the European Rowing Junior Championships and the World Rowing Junior Championships. She had Olympic aspirations. During that 2011 season, she helped transform the Indiana program, leading the Hoosiers to a 14-5 record. She rowed with the Varsity 8 – “the big cheese,” says Peterson – and sat in the “stroke” position. In rowing, the stroke sits closest to the coxswain, and is not unlike the boat’s quarterback. “The stroke sets the rhythm, the pace,” says Peterson. “The best rower sits in the stroke seat.” Peterson calls Keijzer one of the best rowers he’s ever coached, and he’s been at it for 30 years. But during that exit interview that Peterson can’t bear to describe, Keijzer didn’t want to talk about her own performance. “She was just encouraging me, telling me, “Your on the right path, keep doing what you’re doing,” says Peterson. Smitten with Bloomington, Keijzer wound up staying on the IU campus, ditching a potential rowing career for the school’s PhD program in chemistry. So this season, she saw Peterson’s team make it all the way to the NCAA championships for the first time in school history. Peterson traces this success directly back to Keijzer’s boat, which made IU nationally relevant and helped bolster recruiting. “After we finally made it, she says ‘I told you you can do it,’” says Peterson. “She was just so ridiculously supportive.” The Malaysia Flight 17 tragedy has already cost so much. In Keijzer, a senseless act cost of group of rowers a beloved teammate, her fellow chemistry students a popular colleague, and the world a scientist intent on fighting cancer and other diseases. David Giedroc, professor and chair of Indiana’s chemistry department, remembers Keijzer walking into his office as soon as she got on campus. She asked if he would advise him. “Here was this confident young lady, passionate about science and sports,” says Giedroc. “High level science and high level NCAA sports – that’s a fairly exotic combination for a graduate student.” During her first year at IU, when she was both rowing and studying, Keijzer would sometimes fall asleep in her lab chair. Still, she somehow managed to make the 6:00 am practices. “We’d be in the locker room at 5:30, it would be windy, rainy,” says Jaclyn Riedel, one of Keijzer’s teammates. “But she was kind of leading the charge, cheering everyone on. She was just infectious.”The Amsterdam girl took to Indiana, calling herself a “Dutch Hoosier.” To fit in, she came to one party dressed as an ear of corn. “She wore black spandex, a long yellow shirt with frayed edges, and her hair was green,” says Riedel. Her teammates would ask her for informal Dutch lessons, and when they found out the word for garden gnome – kabouter – a select few, including Keijzer and Riedel, started calling themselves “the kabouters.” They headed to Home Depot to pick up a few statuettes. The gnomes became good luck charms. Riedel would carry one in her backpack, “though it never went into the boat,” she says. After wrapping up her rowing career, Keijzer kept pursuing her doctorate. “As a computational chemist, she had enormous potential,” says Giedroc. This summer, Keijzer was working in the Netherlands, collaborating with researchers at VU University Amsterdam on simulations of anti-tumor drugs. At IU, she was working on developing a computer program that calculates how anti-cancer molecules interacted with partner proteins that might play a role in cancer or Alzheimer’s disease. “She was so passionate pharmacological chemistry, and helping people that way,” says Meghan McCormick, Keijzer’s lab mate for four years. “Cancer was just one obstacle she was tackling. She also took on a project seeking better HPV vaccines.” Keijzer and McCormick were co-authors on a study just published in the Journal of the American Chemistry Society, titled: “Understanding Intrinsically Irreversible, Non-Nernstian, Two-Electron Redox Processes: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study of the Electrochemical Activation of Platinum(IV) Antitumor Prodrugs.” McCormick offers the lay explanation: “Many second and third generation cancer drugs aren’t working as well as they could be. We think we can make better ones, based on the methodology and tools that we used.” “She was just a strong woman,” says McCormick. “As a woman in science, a woman in chemistry, she was a big inspiration. We always felt like we had to prove ourselves a little bit more, to fight through the biases. We fed off each other’s strengths.” McCormick starts tearing up. “It’s certainly going to take a very long time to walk into that lab, and not see her sitting next to me,” says McCormick. “I’m so used to seeing her smiling at me, drinking coffee, giving me encouragement.” Keijzer was on the Malaysia Airways flight with her boyfriend, bound for a summer vacation in Indonesia before she returned to Indiana. Kuala Lumpur was a layover. When Peterson, her old coach, got word from a former rower on Thursday that Keijzer was most likely on the plane, he was in a car with his family, on his way to visiting a friend in northern Ohio. He didn’t want to believe it. When he saw the confirmation on Keijzer’s Facebook page, the devastation set in. “She was such an optimist,” says Peterson. “Not just for herself, but for her team, and for everybody around her. She was always there, smiling, a best friend. That’s now all cut way too short. That’s what really makes me sad.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Karlijn Keijzer, a former Indiana University rower and chemistry graduate student, died at 25 in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tragedy. 2. Keijzer was a talented rower who played a key role in transforming Indiana University's rowing program and had a 14-5 record in the 2011 season. 3.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"The answer provided does not accurately address the question about versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell. Instead, the answer focuses on the integration of graphical interface-based management applications with Windows PowerShell. To accurately answer the question, you should provide information on the versions of Windows that do not include PowerShell by default. Here is a detailed answer: PowerShell was first introduced with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Before these versions, Windows systems used other scripting technologies and command tools, such as CMD.exe and VBScript, to manage various system tasks. The versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell by default include: 1. Windows XP: This version of Windows was released in 2001 and does not come with PowerShell pre-installed. However, you can manually install PowerShell 2.0 on Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3). 2. Windows Server 2003: Another version without PowerShell by default, Windows Server 2003, can also be updated to support PowerShell 2.0 with the installation of Service Pack 2 (SP2) and .NET Framework 2.0. 3. Windows 2000: This server and workstation edition was released in 2000, and it does not have PowerShell, nor can it be updated to support it. 4. Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows ME: These versions also do not support PowerShell as they predate the technology. In summary, versions of Windows prior to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista do not come with PowerShell by default. Some of these older versions, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, can be updated to support PowerShell 2.0 by manually installing it along with the necessary service packs and .NET Framework updates. However, earlier versions like Windows NT, 98, ME, and 2000 do not support PowerShell at all."},{"instruction":"This is a question with answer options.

The Winter Olympic Games are usually held two years before the Summer Olympic Games. The ancient Olympic Games began around the year 776 BC in Greece. Many of the sports were the same as they are now. Some of the games in which the young men competed were: running, jumping, and wrestling. Women were not allowed to take part in the games. After about the year 393 AD the Olympic Games stopped. For centuries there were no Olympic Games. But they were not forgotten. The first Olympic Games in modern times happened in 1896. They were held in Greece--the country in which the Games were born. in the Games there were 311 competitors from 13 countries. After that more and more countries joined in the Games.

Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare. - Lake Erie is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the thirteenth-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is deep. Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake. - Downtown Cleveland is the central business district of the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, United States. It is the economic and symbolic center of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area. As of 2000, 100,000 people worked in the district; as of 2012, it contained more than 16 million square feet of rentable office space. - The Lettermen is an American male pop vocal trio. The Lettermen's trademark is close-harmony pop songs with light arrangements. The group started in 1959. They have had two Top 10 singles (both #7), 16 Top 10 singles on the Adult Contemporary chart (including one #1), 32 consecutive Billboard Magazine chart albums, 11 gold records, and five Grammy nominations. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\". - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family. - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. - The O'Jays are an American R&B group from Canton , Ohio , formed in 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert ( born June 16 , 1942 ) , Walter Williams ( born August 25 , 1943 ) , William Powell ( January 20 , 1942 -- May 26 , 1977 ) , Bobby Massey and Bill Isles . The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with \`\` Lonely Drifter '' in 1963 , but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff , a team of producers and songwriters , signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972 . With Gamble & Huff , the O'Jays ( now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey ) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with \`\` Back Stabbers '' ( 1972 ) , and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with \`\` Love Train '' . Numerous other hits followed through the 1970s and into the 80s and 90s , and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 , and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 . - Philadelphia soul, sometimes called Philly soul, the Philadelphia sound or Sweet Philly, is a genre of soul music characterized by funk influences and lush instrumental arrangements, often featuring sweeping strings and piercing horns. The subtle sound of a vibraphone can often be heard in the background of Philly soul songs. The genre laid the groundwork for disco and what are now considered quiet storm and smooth jazz by fusing the R&B rhythm sections of the 1960s with the pop vocal tradition, and featuring a slightly more pronounced jazz influence in its melodic structures and arrangements. - Smooth jazz is a popular genre of music that grew out of jazz and is influenced by rhythm and blues, funk, rock and roll, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). Musicians such as Kenny G, Ramsey Lewis, Dave Koz, and Spyro Gyra have had hits with instrumental recordings, while singers such as Anita Baker, Sade, Sting and Norah Jones have found success with vocal releases. George Benson remains a popular Smooth Jazz artist as both a singer and guitar player. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Quiet storm is a radio format and a subgenre of contemporary R&B music that is characterized by understated, mellow dynamics, slow tempos, and relaxed rhythms. It was pioneered in the mid-1970s by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the radio station WHUR-FM in Washington, D.C.. This style of R&B music is named for Smokey Robinson's 1976 single \\"Quiet Storm\\". - Back Stabbers is a studio album by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays, released in August 1972 on Philadelphia International Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1972. - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) was organized to honor outstanding vocal groups throughout the world by Tony Butala, also the founder (and now only surviving original member) of The Lettermen. Headquartered in Sharon, Pennsylvania, United States, it includes a theater and a museum. - North Coast Harbor is a district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on the shore of Lake Erie. The district serves as the home of the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, FirstEnergy Stadium, the Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum, the USS \\"Cod\\", Burke Lakefront Airport, Voinovich Bicentennial Park, and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. It is served by the West 3rd and North Coast stations on RTA's light rail Waterfront Line. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Philadelphia International Records (PIR) is an American record label based in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1971 by the writer-producer duo, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, along with their long time collaborator Thom Bell. It was famous for showcasing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly soul) that was founded on the gospel, doo-wop, and soul music of the time. This Philly Soul sound later became a prominent and distinct era within R&B itself. During the 1970s the label released a string of worldwide hits which emphasized lavish orchestral instrumentation, heavy bass, and driving percussion. - \\"Love Train\\" is a hit single by The O'Jays, written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Released in 1972, it reached number one on both the R&B Singles and the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, in February and March 1973 respectively, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold by the RIAA. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Ahmet Ertegun (Turkish spelling: Ahmet Ertegün; ( December 14, 2006) was a Turkish-American businessman, songwriter and philanthropist. - Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes. What is the relationship between 'the o'jays' and 'rhythm and blues'? Answer:","output":"The O'Jays are an American R&B (Rhythm and Blues) group that originated from Canton, Ohio. Formed in 1958, they were primarily known for their contributions to the R&B genre, which combined elements of African-American gospel music, jazz, and rhythm and blues. The relationship between The O'Jays and Rhythm and Blues can be seen in their music style, which mainly features soulful melodies, emotive and powerful vocals, and strong rhythmic elements derived from gospel and blues. Their work became synonymous with the often danceable, groovy sounds of R&B, with songs that showcased deeply emotional themes or narrated impactful stories. The O'Jays' partnership with the songwriting and producing duo Gamble & Huff at the Philadelphia International Records transformed their music and took them to greater heights. Their breakthrough came with songs like \\"Back Stabbers\\" (1972) and \\"Love Train\\" (1973), which not only incorporated their R&B roots but also blended elements of Philadelphia soul. This musical fusion helped define their sound for years to come and secured their place as influential artists within the R&B genre. Throughout their career, The O'Jays have been recognized for their significant contributions to R&B by being inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Their enduring impact on rhythm and blues music solidifies their legacy as one of the genre's defining and influential groups."},{"instruction":"Отрасли - Воспитывать и посылать миссионеров за границу служить в других частях Восточной и Южной Азии, где живут люди, не слышавшие Евангелие.

The video has only added to the backlash. Thicke appears with a bloody face in some scenes and stares solemnly into the camera as text messages appear across the screen. Examples: “I wrote a whole album about you.” “I hate myself.” “You embarrassed me.” “You’re reckless.” There’s a lot that’s unclear about the video — why Thicke is bleeding, for one. Nor is there any context for the text messages, so we can only guess as to whether they’re being sent or received. In a particularly troubling moment, Thicke points a finger at his temple. The video ends with a text that reads — rather ominously, following the video’s imagery — “This is just the beginning.” Thicke is no stranger to controversy around his songs or music videos. (Ahem, “Blurred Lines.”) But if we’re buying – literally – into the idea that Thicke wants his wife back, the general consensus is that he’s going about it the wrong way. “What rhymes with desperate?” asked Jezebel. “This might be how you sell a few albums, but it’s certainly not how you reconcile with your estranged wife,” wrote Vulture. If Thicke’s “Paula” offers a look at how not to do a song about someone you love(d), it’s worth taking a look at what goes into making a great song (or even an entire album) about an ex — without it being creepy or anticlimactic. In-laws, am I right? In 2001, Outkast nailed the complexities of shared custody with “Ms. Jackson,” widely understood to be about Andre 3000′s relationship with Erykah Badu. Written as an apology to the mother of an ex, the song gives a detailed — and respectful — look at a relationship that started with good intentions on the part of two people in love. Do we know for sure that it’s about Badu? Of course not. Which brings us to… It’s been more than 40 years since Carly Simon released “You’re So Vain” and we still don’t know who paired a strategically placed hat with an apricot scarf. Simon whispered a clue in a 2009 re-recording of the song, but it didn’t give us the answer, just a qualifier. “You probably think this song is about you” — if your name is David. Alas, David is a very common name. Taylor Swift is arguably the queen of writing about her real-life relationships. Love or loathe her, she keeps it pretty consistent with her breakup-inspired hits. So consistent, in fact, that the liner notes of her most recent albums included coded clues for fans to over-analyze. Swift’s last album “Red,” had fans guessing which songs were about Jake Gyllenhaal. It’s a pretty safe bet that the well-reviewed ballad, “All Too Well” is Gyllenhaal-inspired. And it’s a classic Swift narrative – detailed, but relatable. Kanye West’s genre-eschewing 2008 album, “808s and Heartbreak,” was recorded on the heels of his mother’s death and his breakup with fiance Alexis Phifer. As a result, the album’s lyrics are raw and revealing. Not everyone loved the trip down misery lane, but it was a breakthrough for West, who has only gone on to take more artistic risks (see: “Yeezus“). It’s worth noting that in his review of “808s and Heartbreak,” Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards called it “an album so exquisite, so assured, it threatens to invent an entirely new strand of urban pop music.” Bethonie Butler is a producer and a reporter on The Post’s engagement team.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive. When would Donald Trump receive the Farm Bill - after the House approves it - not enough information - before Paul Ryan approves it - before the House approves it A:","output":"Donald Trump would receive the Farm Bill after the House of Representatives approves it. To provide more context, the Farm Bill's passage requires a majority vote in both the House and the Senate. Once the bill passes through both chambers of Congress, it will then move to the President's desk, where President Trump can either sign it into law or veto it. In the situation provided, the Farm Bill failed to pass the House by a 193-213 vote, largely due to disagreements on immigration and the Goodlatte Bill among Republican factions. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc, wanted to ensure an immigration bill would be brought up for a vote in exchange for their support on the Farm Bill. However, a deal could not be reached, and as a result, the Farm Bill failed to garner enough votes for approval. In order for President Trump to receive the Farm Bill, it must first be approved by the House of Representatives, followed by the Senate, and then sent to the President for his signature or veto. As of now, the bill has not made it past the House due to the ongoing disagreements and negotiations on immigration proposals. The future of the Farm Bill is contingent upon resolving these issues and garnering sufficient support in both chambers of Congress."},{"instruction":"How is \\"\\"In the history of our countries there has never been such a problem.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"In the history of our countries there has never been such a problem.\\" can be translated into Turkish as follows: \\"Ülkelerimizin tarihinde hiç böyle bir sorun yaşanmamıştır.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - In the history (tarihinde): The word \\"tarih\\" means history, and to say \\"in the history,\\" you can use the suffix \\"de\\" which has a similar meaning to \\"in\\" or \\"at.\\" Depending on the noun, there might be a slight change; for \\"tarih,\\" the suffix becomes \\"inde,\\" and thus you get \\"tarihinde.\\" This represents the English words \\"in the history.\\" - of our countries (ülkelerimizin): The main thing here is to express \\"our countries.\\" In Turkish, the word \\"ülke\\" means country.

Ground: This is one of the incorrect places to throw garbage. Throwing garbage on the ground leads to littering, which can cause land pollution, attract pests, and harm both humans and animals.

It could damage the appliance or cause accidents, and it still wouldn't be a proper waste disposal method. 4. Trashcan: This is the correct place to throw garbage. Trash cans are specifically designed to collect waste materials so that they can be disposed of properly, avoiding littering and pollution. 5. Floor: Throwing garbage on the floor is another incorrect option. Like the ground, this can lead to clutter and pollution, posing potential health hazards and creating an unsightly environment. Therefore, both \\"ground\\" and \\"floor\\" are incorrect places to throw garbage, and the proper place for disposal is in a trashcan."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who said Beat It was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece? from the following article ? Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Context: In March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by the Russian monarchist Piotr Shabelsky-Bork as he was trying to shield the real target, Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party-in-exile. This mistaken, violent death would echo again and again in Nabokov's fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (In Pale Fire, for example, one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet John Shade, when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague. Nabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the emigre community and published under the nom de plume V. Sirin (a reference to the fabulous bird of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons. Of his fifteen Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: \\"He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, the petty immigration officials at the police headquarters.\\" In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her. In May 1923, he met a Russian-Jewish woman, Vera Evseyevna Slonim, at a charity ball in Berlin and married her in April 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934. In 1936, Vera lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment; also in that year the assassin of Nabokov's father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian emigre group. In the same year, Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Russian emigree Irina Guadanini. Yet the family followed him to France, making enroute their last visit to Prague, then spent time in Cannes, Menton, Cap d'Antibes, and Frejus and finally settled together in Paris. In May 1940, the Nabokov family fled from the advancing German troops to the United States on board the SS Champlain, with the exception of Nabokov's brother Sergei, who died at the Neuengamme concentration camp on 9 January 1945. Question: Did Vera go with him. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Vera went with Vladimir Nabokov. They first met at a charity ball in Berlin, got married, and had a child named Dmitri. When they left Germany for France, Vera and Dmitri followed Vladimir. Later, when the family had to leave France because of the advancing German troops, they all moved to the United States together."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position.

The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Now, I have a new situation: Bill is working in a sound studio recording sound effects for a short film that he is working on. Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program. Answer this question please: Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds?

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

The deadline to sign up for insurance in order to have coverage by Jan. 1 was supposed to be Tuesday at midnight. But the administration has programmed its systems so that anyone who got in line Monday but takes until Tuesday night to enroll will still get covered by Jan 1. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tried to downplay the change. A spokeswoman continued to stress that the deadline is technically Monday, even while confirming it would be pushed back to Tuesday. \\"The deadline for signing up for coverage to start January 1 is today,\\" spokeswoman Julie Bataille said. \\"We recognize that many have chosen to make their final decisions on today's deadline and we are committed to making sure they can do so. Anticipating high demand and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones, we have taken steps to make sure that those who select a plan through tomorrow will get coverage for Jan 1.\\" CMS confirmed the change after The Washington Post first reported it. The acknowledgement came as applicants encountered site problems on Monday, with users being placed in a virtual waiting line when the system was overloaded. But the agency compared the tweak to Election Day, when people in line when the polls close would still get to vote. Still, the ObamaCare rollout has been marked by a series of delays, both minor and major. Another, letting those whose plans were canceled sign up for bare-bones coverage, was announced right before the holiday break. A Republican National Committee spokesman called the latest delay an \\"opaque move\\" from an administration that vowed to be transparent. In Ohio, Republican Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor called the deadline extension \\"a clear sign Healthcare.gov continues to struggle.\\" \\"Consumers are already confused and insurers are overwhelmed with the administration's last-minute changes, yet there seems to be no end in sight,\\" said Taylor, who heads Ohio's insurance department, said. The administration claimed that the site was running well Monday afternoon, saying Healthcare.gov received a record 850,000 visits, five times the number logged by the same time last Monday. Bataille said the system was handling the volume with error rates of less than 1 in 200 and response times of less than one second. Obama said on Friday that more than 1 million Americans had enrolled for coverage since Oct. 1. The administration's estimates call for 3.3 million to sign up by Dec. 31, and the target is 7 million by the end of March. After that, people who fail to buy coverage can face tax penalties. Minnesota, one of the states running their own insurance exchanges, extended its Monday deadline to Dec. 31 amid problems with its website and extra-long hold times to reach its help center. Maryland pushed back its cutoff date to Dec. 27. New York extended its deadline to midnight Tuesday. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"The Obama administration extended the deadline for Americans in 36 states to sign up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by 24 hours, giving them an additional opportunity to sign up for insurance and have coverage by January 1st. The original deadline was Tuesday at midnight, but the extension allowed those who started the process on Monday to enroll until Tuesday night. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) downplayed the change, with spokeswoman Julie Bataille stressing that the deadline was still technically Monday. However, the extension was put in place to account for higher demand and users in multiple time zones. The ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, faced several delays in its rollout, leading to criticisms from Republican representatives who accused the administration of being opaque in their decision-making."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you will be given a passage, a question and a list of single-word events identified from the passage.

He later died from heart failure in hospital as a result of heatstroke. The drug ecstasy was in his blood at the time of his death at Lucknow Barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire, on 3 July 2006, the inquest in Salisbury was told.

Which radiation have shorter wavelengths, rad A or rad B? Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Hint: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. The answer is:","output":"Rad A has shorter wavelengths than rad B. In the given paragraph, Mark studied the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth, and he labeled Sun's radiation as rad A. Solar radiation (sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun, and Earth also emits radiation back into space. This emitted radiation from Earth is labeled as rad B. It is mentioned that longer wavelength radiations produce heat. Since Earth's radiation (rad B) has longer wavelengths, it means that the radiation Earth receives from the Sun, rad A, has shorter wavelengths. Additionally, we can infer that rad A, being solar radiation, contains more energy than rad B, as shorter wavelength radiations typically have higher energy levels than those with longer wavelengths. Earth emits the absorbed energy back into space at longer wavelengths, which we cannot see, further confirming the difference between the two types of radiation. Moreover, part of the incoming and emitted radiation can be absorbed or reflected by the Earth's atmosphere. The glints of light seen from an orbiting satellite confirm that some of the radiation is reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. In this case, we can also understand that solar radiation (rad A) is more likely to be reflected due to its shorter wavelengths, while Earth's radiation (rad B) is more likely to be absorbed due to its longer wavelengths."},{"instruction":"Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The 16-year-old won bronze at the European Championships to become Britain's first female gymnast to win an individual all-around medal.

It clarifies that the trees encircle the lake and, consequently, provides information on the spatial arrangement of these elements. The word \\"around\\" helps to emphasize the proximity of the trees to the lake and creates an image of their interconnectedness. 4. \\"Edge\\": The word \\"edge\\" focuses on a specific part of the lake, signifying a boundary or a transition between the lake's surface and the surrounding land. By defining the location of the trees, it enables the reader to better form the complete scene in their mind. The \\"edge\\" may also hint at a shoreline or bank, helping to shape the features of the landscape visually. These four words are crucial for creating a vivid mental image of the depicted scene. Together, they allow the reader to understand the relationship between the lake and the trees, offering a glimpse into the location's appearance and atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Bob is an astrophysicist. He was pondering about the beginning of our universe. He pinpointed the time when the universe just began to exist. He labeled it as point A. To compare it with present situation of the universe he labeled the present time as point B. In which time the redshift was greater, point A or point B?","output":"The redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched as the universe expands. When the universe was younger, it was denser and smaller, and as it expanded, the wavelength of light was stretched, causing a redshift. In the context of the scenario described, comparing point A (the beginning of the universe) and point B (the present time), the redshift was greater at point A. At point A, the universe was in its early stages, and the matter and radiation were much denser. As a result, the photons of light had to travel through this dense environment, which caused them to interact more with charged particles. The process of interactions and stretching of the wavelength of light is what causes the redshift. Over time, the universe expanded and evolved into the state it is in now, which is point B. The size of the universe increased, and the radiation and matter became less dense and the interaction of light with the charged particles reduced. This allowed the photons to travel more freely, causing a smaller redshift at point B. So, between point A and point B, the redshift was greater at point A, near the beginning of the universe. This greater redshift signifies the smaller size and denser conditions of the universe at its early stages compared to its present state at point B."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits...

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Despite a vociferous campaign by workers MG Rover failed to survive. As the U.S. authorities contemplate how to respond to pleas for help from the \\"Big Three\\" -- GM, Ford and Chrysler-- they might pause to reflect on the experiences of past British governments when they tried to help the troubled British Leyland group in its various historical forms. The proverb's essence can be adapted to the auto industry, shedding light on one of the primary concerns with bailouts: the dependency on government assistance and the difficulty of breaking free from it. Bailing out companies may provide a short-term solution for immediate financial crises but can lead to long-term consequences in terms of fostering dependency and stifling the self-reliance necessary for long-term success. Looking at the case of British Leyland, a more extensive review serves to reinforce this cautionary tale. Initially supported by the UK government in the 1970s, the company continued to face financial difficulties despite the significant assistance it received, resulting in further funding requests. The consistent reliance on government aid ultimately deterred British Leyland from making major structural changes, investing in innovation, and focusing on its competitive strengths vital for survival within the auto industry marketplace. As the U.S. authorities consider the pleas from GM, Ford, and Chrysler, they must take into account the potential pitfalls and challenges posed by previous instances, avoiding the same mistakes made with British Leyland. Instead of merely providing monetary support, alternative strategies should be explored. This could include providing direct investment in long-term sustainable projects such as research and development or facilitating partnerships between the auto companies and other industries, encouraging innovation and growth. Conditional bailouts could also be considered, where the \\"Big Three\\" are required to meet certain strict criteria before receiving aid in order to avoid the creation of an unhealthy dependency. These criteria may include commitments to increased efficiency, cost-saving measures, and the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies that favour the companies in the future. Furthermore, authorities should consider the wider implications of bailouts, such as the potential distortion of market dynamics and the risk of moral hazard. When large corporations perceive that they can rely on government bailouts, they may engage in riskier business practices and consequently undermine the stability of their respective industries. To prevent this, the government should ensure that any aid provided is balanced with measures to enhance market discipline and prudent risk management. In conclusion, while the experiences of British Leyland and the proverb, \\"Once you have paid the Dane-geld, you'll never get rid of the Dane,\\" serve as warnings to governments considering company bailouts, it is vital that careful analysis and alternate solutions are explored. Although financial assistance may appear as a simple solution, the potential long-term consequences of creating dependency, distorting market dynamics, and exposing companies to moral hazard risk should not be overlooked. Instead, authorities should focus on fostering and supporting sustainable solutions that aim to strengthen the \\"Big Three\\" and promote innovation in the auto industry. Through careful consideration of the past and by implementing alternative strategies, governments can navigate this challenging landscape without repeating the errors of their predecessors."},{"instruction":"Che Cartwright was born on 14 March , 1981 in Erdington , West Midlands .

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be? Available choices: (a). description. (b). entity. (c). abbreviation. (d). human. (e). numeric. (f). location. A:","output":"The answer to the given question is a description. So, the correct option is (a). Let me provide you with the explanation. Marl is a calcium carbonate-rich sedimentary rock that forms when calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitates from water, often in shallow marine environments. The formation of marl involves the following steps: 1. Accumulation of organic matter: As aquatic organisms like algae and small marine animals die, their remains accumulate on the seafloor. These organisms are composed of calcium carbonate, a major component of their shells and body structures. 2. Dissolution of calcium carbonate: Over time, the water's chemistry, temperature, and pressure can cause the calcium carbonate in the deposited organic matter to dissolve. This dissolved calcium carbonate contributes to the formation of marl. 3. Precipitation of calcium carbonate: When the water becomes saturated with calcium carbonate, it starts to precipitate, forming solid calcium carbonate crystals. 4. Accumulation of precipitated calcium carbonate: The precipitated calcium carbonate accumulates and mixes with other sediments such as clay, silt, and sand. This mixture creates layers over time, eventually forming marl. 5. Compaction and cementation: Over time, the weight of the overlying sediments causes compaction and cementation of the marl layers. The compaction squeezes out the water and the cementation binds the particles together, solidifying the marl. The primary mineral present in marl is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), often in the form of calcite or aragonite. Additionally, marl rocks may also contain other minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, fill out the missing word with a 'no' or a number (between zero and ten).

Yes or no? Answer: An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Question: what kind of earthquake was haiti Answer:","output":"The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010, along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system, which is a major fault line running through Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic. This type of earthquake is known as a strike-slip earthquake. A strike-slip earthquake occurs when two tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally along a fault line. In the case of the Haiti earthquake, the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate interact along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system. The relative motion of these two plates generates stress, which is released as earthquakes when the fault slips suddenly. Consequently, this type of earthquake can cause devastating damage, as it did in Haiti in 2010. The Haiti earthquake's epicenter was located approximately 16 miles (25 kilometers) west of the capital city, Port-au-Prince. The disaster was particularly severe due to several factors. Firstly, the earthquake's shallow depth of approximately 8 miles (13 kilometers) meant that the seismic energy was released close to the Earth's surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking. Secondly, Port-au-Prince and its surrounding areas have a high population density, and many of the buildings were not constructed to withstand such a strong earthquake. As a result, there was widespread devastation, with an estimated 230,000 to 316,000 fatalities, 300,000 injured and around 2 million people displaced. Rescue and relief efforts faced immense challenges due to the scale of the disaster. This mission was further complicated by the fact that the country's already weak infrastructure, including roads, communication networks, hospitals, and other essential services, suffered extensive damage in the quake. The international community mobilized rapidly to provide aid, and various organizations and countries participated in the relief and reconstruction efforts. However, the sheer magnitude of the catastrophe meant that progress has been slow, with many people still living in temporary shelters even years after the event. In conclusion, the 2010 Haiti earthquake was a devastating strike-slip earthquake that affected an estimated 3 million people, with catastrophic consequences for the nation and its people. The disaster highlighted the importance of improving building standards in seismically active regions, and the need for coordinated international efforts to respond to large-scale natural disasters."},{"instruction":"If \\"A couple workers carry orange paint by a man in a white hard hat.\\", can we conclude \\"The workers are going to paint a house orange.\\"?","output":"Based on the given statement, \\"A couple workers carry orange paint by a man in a white hard hat,\\" it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"The workers are going to paint a house orange.\\" There are several reasons why this conclusion may not be accurate, and it is important to consider various aspects of the information provided before jumping to any conclusions. 1. Limited information: The statement provides limited information about the workers' intentions or the purpose of carrying the orange paint. It merely describes an observation without providing any context or clear goal. 2. Alternative purposes: There could be alternative purposes for carrying the orange paint. The workers might be using the paint for a different type of construction project, artistic work, or for marking specific areas that need attention within a site. Without additional context, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact purpose of the orange paint. 3. Color combinations: Even if we assume that the workers are indeed going to paint a house, there is no clear indication that the entire house will be painted orange. The orange paint might be used as an accent color, combined with other colors, or serve a specific function, such as to highlight specific features of the house. 4. Multiple tasks: The workers carrying the orange paint might be involved in multiple tasks, and it could be coincidental that they are passing by a man in a white hard hat. They could also be on their way to paint a portion of a larger structure, like an apartment complex, office building, or even a mural. 5. Paint disposal or pick up: The workers might be carrying the orange paint for the purpose of disposal, or they might be transporting the paint from one location to another, without necessarily intending to use it on a specific project. In conclusion, while it is a possibility that the workers are going to paint a house orange based on the statement, it is not certain, and we cannot definitively conclude that this is the case.

Let's say we want to convert the binary number 100110112 to decimal. First, write it down. Then, write down the powers of two from right to left. Start at 20, evaluating it as \\"1\\". Increment the exponent by one for each power. Stop when the amount of elements in the list is equal to the amount of digits in the binary number. The example number, 10011011, has eight digits, so the list, with eight elements, would look like this: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 Now, just write 10011011 below the numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 so that each binary digit corresponds with its power of two. The \\"1\\" to the right of the binary number should correspond with the \\"1\\" on the right of the listed powers of two, and so on. You can also write the binary digits above the powers of two, if you prefer it that way. What's important is that they match up. Draw lines, starting from the right, connecting each consecutive digit of the binary number to the power of two that is next in the list above it. Begin by drawing a line from the first digit of the binary number to the first power of two in the list above it. Then, draw a line from the second digit of the binary number to the second power of two in the list. Continue connecting each digit with its corresponding power of two. This will help you visually see the relationship between the two sets of numbers. Move through each digit of the binary number. If the digit is a 1, write its corresponding power of two below the line, under the digit. If the digit is a 0, write a 0 below the line, under the digit. Since \\"1\\" corresponds with \\"1\\", it becomes a \\"1.\\" Since \\"2\\" corresponds with \\"1,\\" it becomes a \\"2.\\" Since \\"4\\" corresponds with \\"0,\\" it becomes \\"0.\\" Since \\"8\\" corresponds with \\"1\\", it becomes \\"8,\\" and since \\"16\\" corresponds with \\"1\\" it becomes \\"16.\\" \\"32\\" corresponds with \\"0\\" and becomes \\"0\\" and \\"64\\" corresponds with \\"0\\" and therefore becomes \\"0\\" while \\"128\\" corresponds with \\"1\\" and becomes 128. Now, add up the numbers written below the line. Here's what you do: 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 155. This is the decimal equivalent of the binary number 10011011. Now, all you have to do is write 15510, to show that you are working with a decimal answer, which must be operating in powers of 10. The more you get used to converting from binary to decimal, the more easy it will be for you to memorize the powers of two, and you'll be able to complete the task more quickly. You can use this method even when you want to covert a binary number such as 1.12 to decimal. All you have to do is know that the number on the left side of the decimal is in the units position, like normal, while the number on the right side of the decimal is in the \\"halves\\" position, or 1 x (1/2). The \\"1\\" to the left of the decimal point is equal to 20, or 1. The 1 to the right of the decimal is equal to 2-1, or .5. Add up 1 and .5 and you get 1.5, which is 1.12 in decimal notation.","output":"The article explains in detail the process of converting a binary number to its decimal equivalent by illustrating the steps using the example of the binary number \\"10011011\\" which translates to the decimal number \\"155\\"."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Baby girls make their way directly for dolls as soon as they can crawl, while boys will head for cars, a study has shown. The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \\"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\\" Question: What conclusion did Dr. Brenda Todd draw from the results of the study? Options: A: Adults purposely influence their babies' preference. B: Babies' preference isn't affected by social surroundings. C: Baby boys preferring to moving toys will be good at hunting. D: Baby girls preferring warmer colors will be warm-hearted. A:","output":"Dr. Brenda Todd drew the conclusion that there could be a biological basis for babies' choices in toys, with boys preferring moving objects possibly due to hunting instincts, while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink. This suggests that their preferences aren't solely affected by social surroundings, though socialization may still play a role in shaping these preferences. So, the best answer would be option B: Babies' preference isn't affected by social surroundings only, as there might be a biological basis for their choices as well."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"What happened in the 19th century?\\" Context: \\"In 1899, the university opened a national design contest for the new campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"During the 19th century, significant social, political, economic, and technological changes occurred across the world, shaping the course of history and laying the foundation for the modern era. However, in the context given, we can focus specifically on the developments in education and architecture that led to the establishment of the university and its campus mentioned in the passage. In the early 19th century, tertiary education gained importance throughout the United States and Europe. The establishment and growth of universities aimed at providing higher education, advancing scientific research, and promoting cultural and scholarly enrichment. The 19th century witnessed a proliferation of universities, providing opportunities for students from various social backgrounds to access higher education and contribute to the development of society. In this context, the university mentioned in the passage initiated a design contest in 1899 to plan their new campus. The architectural competition attracted distinguished participants, and the top design proposal came from the respected Philadelphia firm, Cope & Stewardson. Their design incorporated the Collegiate Gothic architectural style, inspired by the prestigious universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. Collegiate Gothic architecture was popular among university campuses in the 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by its ornate and decorative elements, extensive use of stone, and grand, historic ambiance. The construction of the campus began in 1900 with the cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall. Subsequently, other key structures such as Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples were built. In anticipation of the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics, the university deferred occupying these buildings until 1905. This postponement allowed for the construction of ten buildings in total instead of the initially planned seven. The 19th century World's Fair was a significant global event, showcasing advancements in various fields, such as technology, science, and culture. By hosting the World's Fair and Olympics, the university demonstrated its commitment to providing a top-tier education for its students, aligning itself with the latest innovations and global standards of excellence. The 19th century brought forth ideas and advancements that greatly influenced the architectural design and construction of this university campus. Cope & Stewardson's vision for a series of Gothic quadrangles set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus, shaping its growth and development in years to come. The choice of building materials and adherence to the Collegiate Gothic style became guiding principles for the construction and expansion of the campus. Ultimately, these 19th-century influences contributed to the prestigious reputation and distinctive aesthetic of the university in question."},{"instruction":"Last from us, Please share this article, Clash Royale Hack Online, if this tool is working Please remove spaces between words.","output":"As an AI language model, I regret that I cannot share, promote, or endorse any hacking tools or any form of cheating in games.

In February 2013 the school opened a pastoral dining area and new offices , in May 2013 followed a new auditorium and library . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"The two sentences convey similar information, but there are slight differences in meaning and structure. Let's break down each of them to understand the similarities and differences. Sentence 1: \\"In February 2013, the school opened a new dining area and pastoral offices, followed by a new assembly hall and library in May 2013.\\" This sentence is structured in chronological order, stating the events as they happened. It informs us that in February 2013, the school opened a new dining area and pastoral offices. Then, in May 2013, a new assembly hall and library were opened. The use of \\"followed by\\" here implies a sequential order of events. Sentence 2: \\"In February 2013 the school opened a pastoral dining area and new offices, in May 2013 followed a new auditorium and library.\\" This sentence is structured less clearly, but it tries to convey the same information as the first sentence. However, there are differences in the description of the facilities. The first sentence refers to a \\"dining area\\" and specifies the offices as \\"pastoral offices\\". In contrast, the second sentence refers to a \\"pastoral dining area\\", which implies that the dining area is associated with pastoral care, and it only mentions \\"new offices\\" without specifying their purpose. Additionally, the second sentence uses the term \\"auditorium\\" instead of \\"assembly hall\\", which could imply a more expansive or multipurpose facility. Another notable difference is that the second sentence incorrectly uses \\"followed\\" - it should be \\"followed by\\" to connect the events in the same way as the first sentence. To conclude, while both sentences convey the message that the school opened new facilities in February and May 2013, there are differences in their structure and descriptions. The first sentence is clearer and provides more accurate details about the events and facilities, whereas the second sentence contains some discrepancies and lacks clarity in its presentation of the events."},{"instruction":"AFP - Utah Jazz point guard Raul Lopez, a Spaniard who has missed the past two months while battling torn right knee ligaments, was activated by the National Basketball Association club.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the described process is: \\"Open the dishwasher door.\\" This step is essential before any other steps can be carried out. Here is the complete process with the missing step added: 1. Open the dishwasher door: Ensure the dishwasher door is unlatched and gently pull it open, usually by grasping a handle or recessed area at the top or side of the door. This will provide access to the internal racks and compartments of the dishwasher. 2. Slide out the bottom rack: Grasp the bottom rack, usually designed to hold larger items such as plates, pots, and pans, and gently slide it out towards you. This will expose the sections of the rack specifically designed to hold these items securely during the dishwasher cycle. 3. Take a dirty plate: Retrieve a dirty plate from a nearby countertop or collection area, preparing it for rinsing and placement into the dishwasher. 4. Rinse the plate: Hold the dirty plate under a running tap with warm water, using your hand or a non-abrasive scrubbing tool to remove any large food particles or debris. This pre-rinsing helps ensure that the dishwasher can properly clean and sanitize the dish during its cycle. 5. Place the dish in the rack: Once rinsed, insert the plate into the corresponding slot in the dishwasher's bottom rack, ensuring it is securely positioned and adequately spaced from any surrounding items. 6. Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items: Continue this process for your remaining dirty dishes, always making sure to leave enough space between each item to promote efficient water circulation and thorough cleaning. Overloading the dishwasher or placing items too close together can reduce its effectiveness and result in unclean dishes. 7. Fill the soap cup: Locate the dishwasher's detergent dispenser, which is typically a small compartment with a door or cover. Open the compartment and measure out the appropriate amount of dishwasher detergent according to your appliance's instructions, adding the detergent to the soap cup. 8. Turn on the dishwasher: After the dishes are properly loaded and the detergent is in place, close the dishwasher door firmly, ensuring it latches securely.

The focus is on the game itself and the actions of the players within that game. In this situation, the adults are not only present but are also actively participating in the game. They pursue the ball, strategize, and compete against one another, just as any player would during a live soccer match. The term \\"adult soccer game\\" signifies that it is a game involving and designed for adult participants, but it does not provide information about the audience or the fact if there are any children watching the game or not. 2.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a creature named The Once-ler, a being who is never seen, except for his long green arms. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans.

The story revolves around the Once-ler, who initially comes to the area and is mesmerized by the beauty and uniqueness of the truffula trees. He decides to establish a business by cutting down the trees and using their tufts to create a multipurpose item called Thneed. As the demand for Thneeds grows, the Once-ler's business expands, harming the environment and causing devastating consequences for the local ecosystem. The Lorax, who claims to speak for the trees, tries to warn the Once-ler of the damage he's causing. He points out the consequences, such as the Bar-ba-Loots running out of truffula fruits to eat, the Swomee Swans being unable to sing due to the smog from the factories, and the pollution in the Humming Fish's pond.

Hypothesis: A man is taking a break for work. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis, we will examine the premise and look for supporting evidence. Step 1: Identify the given information in the premise - There is a man. - He is wearing a coat. - He is leaning against a building. Step 2: Analyze the details in the premise to see if they support the hypothesis - A man is taking a break for work. - While a man leaning against a building could suggest that he is taking a break, there is no information directly supporting the hypothesis that the break is work-related. Step 3: Consider alternative explanations - The man could be waiting for someone. - He could be taking a break from a non-work activity or event, such as a leisurely walk. - He might simply be resting his feet. Conclusion: While it is possible that the man is taking a break from work, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The man could be taking a break for various reasons, and additional information or context is necessary to confirm or deny the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"What is the solution? Solve 0 = -14*o + 4*o - 40 for o.","output":"In order to solve the given equation for 'o', one should follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left-hand side The equation right now is 0 = -14*o + 4*o - 40. The like terms are -14*o and 4*o. Subtract 4o from -14o to yield -10o. Thus, the simplified equation becomes 0 = -10*o - 40. Step 2: Re-arrange the equation This gets all the 'o' terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Adding 10*o to both sides gives 10*o = - 40. Step 3: Divide by coefficient of o In this equation, the coefficient of 'o' is 10. So you divide by 10 on both sides. Hence, the solution of the equation is o = -40 / 10. Step 4: Compute the result By doing the division, the solution for 'o' becomes o = -4. So, the solution for the equation 0 = -14*o + 4*o - 40 is o = -4."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.

Advantage will be taken of his offer.","output":"The sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable, though it may sound somewhat formal and less common in everyday conversation. It is a passive construction, meaning the action is emphasized rather than the person or entity performing the action. It is also a future construction, indicating that the action of taking advantage of the offer has not yet occurred. Let's break down the sentence structure and components to better understand its linguistic acceptability: 1. Subject: In this passive construction, the subject is \\"advantage,\\" which serves as the entity that the action is applied to or affected by. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"will\\" is used to indicate the future tense in English and implies that the action has not yet taken place, but is expected to at a later point in time. 3. Main verb: \\"be taken\\" is the passive form of the verb \\"take\\"; it is conjugated in the passive voice to place emphasis on the action (taking advantage) rather than on the person or entity performing the action. In this case, it is not specified who will be taking advantage of the offer. 4. Prepositional phrase: \\"of his offer\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides specific information about the source or object related to the taking of advantage in this sentence. Although linguistically acceptable, this sentence might sound quite formal and may not be the most common way people would express the same idea in everyday spoken English. An alternative and more common way to phrase the same meaning would be: \\"We will take advantage of his offer.\\" This revised sentence is more direct, as it is in the active voice and clearly identifies the person or entity doing the action. However, both sentences convey the same essential meaning. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable as it follows the rules of grammar and syntax within the English language, though it may not be the most common way to express the idea in everyday conversation."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: the militant jamaa islamiyya issued a death threat against the editor - in-chief of an egyptian opposition newspaper on monday for slandering and declaring war on islam .","output":"Militant group Jamaa Islamiyya threatened Egyptian newspaper editor for slandering and attacking Islam.

His doctor said his diet should include vegetables and not donuts because the Select from the following. +vegetables are beneficial.. +donuts are beneficial..","output":"His doctor said his diet should include vegetables and not donuts because the vegetables are beneficial. Vegetables are a crucial aspect of any balanced and healthy diet due to numerous reasons. Firstly, they are packed with vitamins and minerals required by the body to function properly. Essential vitamins such as vitamin A, B, C, and K, along with minerals like potassium, magnesium, and calcium, can be found in a variety of vegetables. These nutrients play a vital role in maintaining the immune system, bone health, and muscle function, as well as supporting overall growth and development. Secondly, vegetables are abundant in dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and gut health. Fiber helps maintain regular bowel movements, prevents constipation, and lowers the risk of developing gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Crohn's disease. Furthermore, increased fiber intake is associated with a lower risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Thirdly, vegetables offer various antioxidants and phytonutrients that help neutralize free radicals and protect the body from oxidative stress. This reduces cell damage, inflammation, and the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and premature aging. In addition, some vegetables, such as cruciferous ones (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), contain compounds that have been shown to exhibit anticancer properties. Lastly, consuming vegetables can help with weight management. They are low in calories and fat but high in water content and fiber, which adds bulk to meals, helps you feel fuller for longer, and discourages overeating. Replacing high-calorie, processed foods, such as donuts, with nutrient-dense, low-calorie vegetables is a practical strategy for managing weight. On the other hand, donuts are generally considered detrimental to one's health, particularly when consumed in excess. They are typically high in calories, unhealthy fats (such as trans fats), and added sugars, which can lead to weight gain, increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and poor heart health. Furthermore, donuts lack the essential nutrients, fiber, and health-promoting compounds found in vegetables. In conclusion, the doctor's recommendation to include vegetables in the patient's diet instead of donuts is based on the understanding that vegetables provide essential nutrients, fiber, and health-enhancing compounds, which promote overall well-being and disease prevention. Donuts, conversely, contribute to unhealthy weight gain and offer little to no nutritional benefits. Therefore, the sentence ends with \\"vegetables are beneficial.\\""},{"instruction":"SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION 2nd meeting Translate to French","output":"Session spéciale numéro sept, deuxième réunion.

This was done in coordination with faculty members who determined that the specimens had been in poor condition when the university received them in the 1980s and were not suitable for research or teaching. Faculty members then maintained possession of other brain specimens in the collection that the university continues to own. This occurred prior to the renovation of the Animal Resources Center, where the specimens had been stored in a secure location. We believe the workers disposed of between 40 and 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains, and worked with a biological waste contractor to do so safely. We are continuing to investigate reports that additional brain specimens were separately sent to other universities or health institutions. Thus far, we have not found any records or documentation to corroborate accounts that some specimens were shared with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio in the 1990s. We have no evidence at this time that any of the brain specimens came from Charles Whitman, though we will continue to investigate those reports. The university will also investigate how the decision was made to dispose of some of these specimens and how all brain specimens have been handled since the university received its collection from the Austin State Hospital in the 1980s. University officials will appoint a broader investigative committee to examine these issues. As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously. University statement from earlier in the day on Dec. 3, 2014: As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously. We are committed to treating the brain specimens with respect and are disheartened to learn that some of them may be unaccounted for. The university plans to investigate the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago. The brains that are now on campus are actively used as a teaching tool and are carefully curated by faculty. As our investigation proceeds, we will seek to confirm whether the specific details that have been reported about the other specimens are accurate.

Related Content ||||| Earlier on Wednesday, a professor at the Austin school told reporters that the brains had been sent to the University of Texas in San Antonio. Hours later, that school denied receiving them, suggesting the brains might have gone to another, separate facility, the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. A spokesman there said they were investigating. ||||| The University of Texas statement said the health and safety officials were thought to have disposed of 40 to 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains. Photo “As far as we know, that accounts for all of them,” said Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the university. “But we’re continuing our investigation to make sure that none went to other institutions.” Mr. Hannaford said he was skeptical of the university’s conclusion that the 100 brains had all been disposed of.

According to the statement, the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection. Last year in Indianapolis, David Charles, 21, was charged with stealing 60 human brains from the Indiana Medical History Museum. The police were tipped off by Brian Kubasco of San Diego, who had bought six of the brains on eBay for 600, and suspected they were stolen. About 48 of the brains were returned to the museum, which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital. All of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a half-century through the 1940s. “These brain collections go back to the mid-1800s, and it’s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear,” said Brian Burrell, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor and author of “Postcards From the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds.” Disposing of such a collection can be awkward, he said, since it may not be possible to give away the brains. Sometimes, he said, an institution does not even know it has them. EBay policy prohibits the sale of human remains, with the exception of hair and skulls, as well as skeletons sold for medical use. But enforcement is not air tight, as evidenced by the Indiana case. While a federal law protecting the burial sites of Native Americans prohibits trade in Indian funeral objects and human remains, it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains. Some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished. “There was one collection of 600 brains, by a Philadelphia anatomist, and no one knows where they are,” Mr. Burrell said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about a university in Texas that had some human brain specimens.

He checked out of his hotel Monday but remains in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, said Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian's Washington bureau chief. \\"The oversight of this process is done in secret.

Sunflowers are ready to harvest once the heads become brown. If you have a particularly wet season however, they can go mouldy [if this is the case you will need to cut off the head once the back of it is yellowing and allow the drying process to continue in a greenhouse or shed]. You should prepare them for the drying process once the back of the head begins to turn yellow to yellow-brown. In order to harvest the seeds, the sunflower head must be completely dry. Otherwise, the flower will not surrender the seeds. A sunflower will reach this state naturally after a few days of beginning to wilt. It is easier to dry sunflowers on the stem if you have dry, sunny weather. If you live in a moist climate, you may want to consider drying them off the stem, instead. At least half of the yellow petals should have dropped before you start preparing the sunflower for harvest. The head of the flower should also begin to droop. It may look dead, but if it still has its seeds, then the sunflower is drying out in a healthy manner. Examine the seeds. Even if they are still stuck on the flower head, they should begin to plump up. The seeds should also be hard and may have their trademark black-and-white striped shell, or purely black, depending on the type of sunflower. Cover the head of the flower with a paper bag, tying the bag on loosely with twine or yarn to prevent it from being knocked off. You could also use cheesecloth or similarly breathable fabric, but you should never use a plastic bag. Plastic will restrict the air flow, causing moisture to build up on the seeds. If too much moisture builds up, the seeds may turn rotted or moldy. Tying a bag over the head prevents birds, squirrels, and most other wildlife from sneaking in and \\"harvesting\\" your sunflower seeds before you do. It also prevents the seeds from dropping to the ground and being lost. If the bag gets wet or torn, carefully remove it and replace it with a fresh, intact paper bag. You may be able to prevent the bag from getting wet during a rainstorm by temporarily placing a plastic bag over it. Do not tie the plastic bag onto the flower head, though, and remove it as soon as the rain lets up to prevent mold from setting in. Change the paper bag as soon as it gets wet. A wet paper bag is more likely to be torn, and mold may even develop on the seeds if they sit in a wet bag for an extended period of time. Collect any seeds that may have dropped off into the old bag when changing it out. Examine the seeds for signs of possible damage, and if they are in good shape, store them in airtight containers until you are ready to harvest the remaining seeds. Once the back of the flower heads turn brown, cut them off and prepare to harvest the seeds. Leave roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) of stem attached to the flower head. Make sure that the paper bag is still securely tied onto the flower head. If it slips off as you remove and transport the sunflower head, you may lose a significant number of seeds.

Sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest of it!!

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

By the time he entered Livermore High School, he was a star in baseball and basketball. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a perfect game in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. Johnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in 1997 with a 20-4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53-9, including a 16-0 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8. Another colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the 1997 edition involving former Expos teammate Larry Walker, at that point with the Colorado Rockies. When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that \\"I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me.\\" In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters' box to stand right-handed for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and, of course, comparisons to the at bat with Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game. In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199. When the 1998 season began, Johnson was upset the Mariners would not offer him a contract extension, given his contract was expiring after the season. Though the Mariners initially wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they fell out of contention, going 8-20 in June. Minutes before the non-waiver trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers, Freddy Garcia, Carlos Guillen, and John Halama.

The inclusion of the paid-for Beats service in an iOS software update, which would instantly make it available on millions of iPhones and iPads, could happen as early as March. The service, which is likely to be rebranded under the iTunes label, will compete with music streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and Soundcloud. Scroll down for video The move will pit Apple against Spotify, which has suffered setbacks following a spat with Taylor Swift and other artists who remain sceptical about the economics of streaming With revenue coming largely from advertising and subscriptions,","output":"music streaming platforms have been seeking ways to differentiate themselves and attract more users in an increasingly saturated market. Apple's integration of the Beats service into their iOS operating system is an attempt to capitalize on its vast user base and leverage the popularity and familiarity of the iTunes brand. By providing users with a native music streaming service, Apple aims to deliver a seamless listening experience that complements its existing ecosystem of products and services. As competition intensifies, Apple's entry into the music streaming space could potentially shake up the industry dynamics, forcing rivals like Spotify, Pandora, and Soundcloud to rethink their strategies and develop new features to retain and grow their user bases. For Apple, this is an opportunity to reinforce its dominant position in the digital music industry, which it pioneered with the introduction of iTunes back in 2001. While revenue from streaming services, which primarily comes from advertisements and user subscriptions, has surpassed sales from digital downloads, many artists still remain skeptical about the financial viability of these platforms. The famous dispute between Spotify and Taylor Swift, wherein the artist removed her entire music catalog from the platform, highlights the ongoing tension between artists and streaming services in terms of fair compensation and value generation. In integrating the Beats service within the iOS operating system, Apple will likely face challenges in striking a balance between maximizing profitability and addressing concerns from artists and industry stakeholders. To succeed in this endeavor, Apple will need to carefully consider its pricing strategy, content acquisition tactics, and find ways to ensure a win-win relationship between the platform and its content creators. Moreover, as users continue to embrace music streaming, Apple's entry could also signal a change in consumer preferences, with more people opting for access to a vast library of songs over owning individual tracks or albums. As a result, Apple's foray into music streaming could further accelerate the decline of digital downloads, leading to a transformation in the way music is consumed, distributed, and monetized in the digital age. In conclusion, Apple's integration of the Beats music service into its iOS operating system is a strategic maneuver designed to capture a portion of the rapidly growing music streaming market and position the company as a major player in the space. The move is expected to push competitors to innovate and adapt, while also spurring ongoing debates around the financial sustainability and value proposition of streaming platforms for artists and content creators. Ultimately, the success of Apple's venture into music streaming will depend on its ability to create a compelling product offering and effectively navigate the complex dynamics of the industry."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

Work on your legs early in the week to allow them ample time to recover.","output":"Incorporate a variety of leg exercises in your routine. When planning your leg workout, aim to include a mix of exercises that target different muscles within the legs, such as quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. This well-rounded approach will not only help you develop a strong and balanced lower body, but also reduce the risk of injury and boredom by preventing muscle imbalances and overuse. Start your workout with compound exercises like squats, lunges, and deadlifts, which engage multiple muscle groups at once and provide the most bang for your buck in terms of strength development. These movements will also help improve your core stability and overall functionality in daily activities. Next, focus on isolation exercises that specifically target your individual leg muscles. Leg curls and leg extensions are excellent options for training your hamstrings and quadriceps, while calf raises can effectively target the calf muscles. Likewise, incorporate exercises that hit the inner and outer thigh muscles, such as side lunges or sumo squats, as well as exercises that target the glutes, like glute bridges and step-ups. To ensure continuous growth and challenge, it is essential to employ a mix of training techniques and equipment. Use various rep ranges and weights to ensure a blend of strength, endurance, and hypertrophy (muscle size) training. Additionally, consider alternating between free weights, bodyweight exercises, and machines to further diversify your workout and engage different muscles in unique ways. Lastly, don't forget to include cardiovascular training in your weekly routine. Cardio exercises like running, biking, or swimming can all help improve the muscular endurance of your leg muscles and overall fitness, as well as promote a healthy cardiovascular system. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardiovascular exercise per week.

They go ahead and run my card, and the bill includes a \\"tip ____\\", which I have proceeded to add, despite the annoyed look I get from the receptionist, as well as the \\"this is the last time miss, we are no longer accepting tips like this\\" statement. So, bring cash to tip your stylist, and if you can, choose either Nena or Mai, they are both nice and good at what they do.","output":"The following review can be considered a mixed one, with aspects of both positive and negative feedback regarding the salon experience. Positive aspects: 1. The reviewer was pleasantly surprised by the salon. 2. The salon's close proximity to the reviewer's home was convenient. 3. Nena, the stylist who the reviewer usually gets, is described as very nice, not too talkative, and assertive. 4. Nena has a good understanding of how to trim bangs for 20-somethings and does not make them look lame or \\"emo.\\" 5. The pricing for trims is reasonable, at around 15 for a 15-minute service. 6. The reviewer is satisfied with the pedicures they received at the salon. 7. Nena and Mai are mentioned as good choices for stylists due to their pleasant demeanor and skill. Negative aspects: 1. The reviewer feels that the pedicures offered at the salon could also be found elsewhere for about 5 less. 2. The salon's recent policy of not accepting tips with credit card payments is seen as inconvenient and makes the client feel uncomfortable. 3. This change of policy may be due to cutting back on expenses, such as bank fees, which the reviewer finds inconsiderate towards clients. 4. The reviewer has encountered an annoyed receptionist and a warning statement regarding the new tipping policy, which may cause further discomfort for clients. In summary, while the reviewer has had overall positive experiences with the salon's services and stylists, there are concerns regarding tipping policies and the value of specific services, such as pedicures. This results in a review with mixed feedback, highlighting both the salon's strengths and areas that could be improved."},{"instruction":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\\"the surroundings\\").[note 3] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive?","output":"Some organisms and systems that are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive include: 1. Photosynthetic bacteria and algae: These microorganisms can convert light energy into chemical energy with relatively high efficiency, often higher than plants. 2. Electric cars: Electric vehicles are known to be more energy efficient than internal combustion engine cars, as they convert a larger percentage of the energy stored in the batteries into mechanical energy for driving. 3. Hydroelectric power plants: Hydroelectric power plants convert the kinetic energy of water in motion into electrical energy, with efficiency levels reaching up to 90% in some cases. 4. Combined heat and power (CHP) systems: These systems are designed to capture and utilize the waste heat generated during the production of electricity from fuels like natural gas and biomass. This can significantly increase the overall efficiency of the energy conversion process. 5. Carnivorous plants: These plants, such as Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, efficiently capture and digest insects to obtain their energy and nutrients, making them highly efficient in their utilization of available resources. 6. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, are known for their impressive metabolic efficiency and ability to extract energy from nectar to power their high-energy flight and hovering behaviors. While these examples represent a range of efficient energy use, it's worth noting that efficiency can be context-dependent and may vary based on the specific conditions or environment in which the organism or system operates."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given an input list A.

Neil had to go to night classes unlike Samuel, because","output":"Neil had a day job that he could not afford to give up. Samuel, on the other hand, had the luxury of attending college full-time because of the scholarship he received. The friends had grown up together and dreamt of pursuing similar careers in the field of computer programming. They each had their unique strengths: Neil took on practical projects to learn on the job, while Samuel would dive into the depths of theory and experiment with intricate algorithms. They made a spectacular team, often working on assigning freelance tasks to each other whenever they had free time. Every evening, as the sun set and the shadow of twilight danced across the city's buildings, Neil would hop onto his old but trusty bicycle and pedal his way to the community college. The autumn air was growing cooler – a signal of the upcoming winter – but nothing would deter Neil from attending his classes. He knew their shared passion would ultimately lead them to their dream careers side by side. The ride to the college would typically take Neil about thirty minutes, giving him ample time to reminisce on past memories with Samuel and muse about the future they both aspired to. There were always a few moments of sadness, as he couldn't help but feel envious of Samuel's privileged position. But Neil was determined and optimistic, knowing that hard work, grit, and sheer determination would eventually pay off. As he rode through the dimly lit streets, the city came to life with the hustle and bustle of nocturnal activities. Street vendors and food trucks lined the edges, tempting him with their delicious aromas. Musicians played their hearts out in small, poorly lit venues, their creativity spilling out into the streets for all to enjoy. And amongst the chaos, Neil found solace and motivation. The night classes were tough, pushing Neil to his limits as he tried to balance his day job and learning of new coding languages. His classmates were a mixed bunch – people from different walks of life, who had come together under the same roof for the same purpose, each with their story to share. Neil found inspiration in their stories and made new friends who understood the unique struggles of balancing work and education. One evening, midway through the semester, Neil was working on a group project tasked with designing a software that could help optimize the city's waste management system. His group was comprised of Gavin, a middle-aged man who had been laid off from his factory job; Emily, a young mother eager to return to the workforce to support her family; and Jess, a young whiz-kid with no formal education but had a remarkably intuitive grasp of coding. The group was incredibly supportive of each other as they worked long, caffeine-fueled nights trying to perfect their prototype. It wasn't long before Neil began to notice the uniqueness of their individual talents and perspectives blending to create something truly spectacular. They had their fair share of disagreements, but in the end, they always managed to find common ground. Towards the end of semester, their software was submitted for grading and eventually chosen to be presented at a tech conference - an opportunity for funding and potential market entry. The excitement reverberated among the group members as they prepared their presentation. Neil knew that this project was something special, and the chance to showcase their hard work was a taste of what he and Samuel had always dreamt about. Neil's hard work finally paid off when their project received massive applause at the conference, won the admiration of their professors, and attracted the interest of venture capitalists willing to put forward funding to turn their prototype into a full-fledged product. As Neil stared into the auditorium filled with applause, his thoughts drifted towards Samuel. He knew that Samuel would be proud of him, but there remained the lingering fear that their divergent journeys might eventually drive them apart. Neil decided then and there that their friendship was of utmost importance. He vowed to ensure that despite their different paths, they would never forget their shared dreams and the moments they spent working together. In the years that followed, Neil and Samuel pursued their separate ways, occasionally collaborating on joint projects and always encouraging one another. Eventually, their unwavering friendship and determination would lead them to cofound a successful start-up, achieving the very dream they had envisioned during their childhood. Their days of night classes and scholarships, of jealousy and envy, would just be anecdotes to recount during late-night programming sessions and company-wide team-building events. And that is how Neil's journey through night classes, a result of his determination and resilience, catalyzed not only his success but also the transformation of his friendship with Samuel and many others. His story will live on as a testament to the power of hard work, friendship, and the human spirit."},{"instruction":"Claim: \\"One can visit the Berlin University of the Arts by travelling to Germany if one is not already in Germany.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?

The 25-year-old scored his first goals of the campaign on Sunday as his brace helped the Hammers record a 3-1 win over 10-man Swansea City and move up to third in the table for more than 24 hours, before Manchester United leapfrogged them. Sam Allardyce's side remain in the top four after 15 games, having won eight of their opening fixtures, as Carroll struck twice and Diafra Sakho scored late to see off the Swans, who had taken the lead through Wilfried Bony. The West Ham boss said his decision would prove right over time, despite the fact","output":"the club had not been considered strong title contenders before the season started. However, with their impressive form, and the team clicking under Allardyce, Carroll believes the club can maintain their position in the upper echelons of the Premier League and potentially make a push for the title. Carroll's confidence in West Ham's ability to challenge for the title is rooted in the squad's depth and quality, as well as the attractive and effective style of play implemented by manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce has been praised for his tactical acumen and adaptability, which have enabled West Ham to become one of the most solid and consistent sides in the league. This has contributed to their remarkable rise to the top four after being mere mid-table finishers in previous seasons. One of the key factors in West Ham's success so far has been the recruitment of quality players during the transfer window. The signing of Diafra Sakho, who has already scored several crucial goals, proved to be an inspired decision by Allardyce, as the Senegalese striker's partnership with Carroll has flourished. The acquisition of Alex Song on loan from Barcelona has added experience and quality to the midfield, while the likes of Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, and Aaron Cresswell have also made significant contributions. Additionally, West Ham's ability to grind out results, even when they are not playing at their best, has been a vital factor in accumulating points in the Premier League. The Hammers have demonstrated resilience and determination in holding onto leads and coming back from losing situations, attributes that are crucial in ensuring long-term success in a competitive league like the Premier League. The club's excellent home form is another reason for their confidence in challenging for the title. West Ham's passionate fan base and the intimidating atmosphere at the London Stadium have played a key role in making the venue a fortress, with several high-profile teams having already dropped points there. This has allowed the team to build momentum, with the players feeding off the supporters' energy and belief. Moreover, the nature of the Premier League itself, known for its unpredictability and upsets, works in West Ham's favor as they attempt to defy the odds and challenge for the title. The competition has become even more open in recent seasons, with traditional powerhouses such as Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea experiencing periods of inconsistency and transition. This unpredictable landscape has created opportunities for less-fancied sides like West Ham to stake their claim for glory. While some may still view West Ham's title challenge as a long shot, Andy Carroll's belief that the Hammers can make an impact at the top end of the Premier League is backed by the evidence of their performances so far, as well as the quality and depth of the squad. With Sam Allardyce at the helm, the club's rise from relegation candidates to potential title contenders is not a mere flash in the pan, but rather an indication of the progress being made at the London Stadium. As the season continues, West Ham United will face numerous challenges, both on and off the pitch. However, if the players maintain their current form, and the management continues to make astute tactical and personnel decisions, there is indeed nothing to stop the Hammers from being genuine contenders for the Barclays Premier League title."},{"instruction":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

Movie title: Green Lantern Movie plot: Millions of years before the Earth was formed, a group of beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower to create an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They split the universe into 3,600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) of Sector 2814, defeated the fear-essence being Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown) and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the ruined planet Ryut. However, in the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison. Six months later, after killing four Green Lanterns and destroying two planets, Parallax attacks Sector 2814 and mortally wounds Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth. The dying Abin Sur commands his ring to find a worthy successor on the planet.Ferris Aircraft test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, by telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath.

After he's attacked while leaving a bar Jordan swings to punch one of his attackers, letting out a huge fist of green energy. Afterward, Jordan is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with Tomar-Re (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) and Kilowog (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan). He encounters Corps leader Sinestro (Mark Strong), who is not pleased that a human which is primitive compared to other species has become a Green Lantern.

El embajador Valero argumentó que la gobernanza democrática \\"debe tener como fundamento la justicia y sociedades más inclusivas\\". En esta declaración, el embajador Valero resalta la importancia de abordar y combatir los problemas de pobreza y exclusión en un país con un sistema democrático. Para que una democracia funcione efectivamente, es crucial que todos los ciudadanos sean incluidos en el proceso y tengan acceso a una vida digna y justa. Por lo tanto, la justicia y la inclusión social deben ser elementos fundamentales en cualquier democracia. Para lograr una democracia más justa e inclusiva, los gobiernos y las instituciones democráticas deben abordar diversos aspectos de la sociedad, como reducir la pobreza, mejorar la calidad de vida, promover la igualdad de oportunidades y proteger los derechos de las minorías. Estas acciones asegurarán que todas las personas puedan desempeñar un papel activo en la toma de decisiones y disfrutar de los beneficios y oportunidades que ofrece un sistema democrático. Además, es importante reconocer que incluso las democracias consideradas \\"exitosas\\" pueden enfrentar desafíos relacionados con la exclusión y la injusticia.

The 83 year-old actor, who usually drives a 2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, will ride from Chicago to Los Angeles this summer on the Rivet, a custom made tricycle he helped design. Scroll down for video. The finished trike will be a two seater powered by a V8 engine, and will transport Shatner across America this summer. Shatner helped design the trike, which will go on sale later this year. Shatner says the design is inspired by an aircraft wing from the B-17 bomber. 'The finest line I can ever remember seeing was on a wing,' he said. 'Bombardier had lend me an aeroplane, and I remember the sweeping stainless steel part of the wing. 'If design can move you emotionally, that did - and I want to see that in the bike' To make the trike a reality, Shatner is working with Illinois company American Wrench, a motorcycle fabrication firm that's provided frames to Orange County Choppers among others. He has worked with the firm on the design, requesting many of the features - and rejecting a few others. 'To me, flame throwers are a little excessive,' he tells them in one meeting. The two seater trike will have a canopy to protect riders, and, crucially for shatner, will also be able to wheelie. 'This will do a wheelie in 4th gear,' he says. 'I've been across this country in sport cars, in trucks, with a dog, with a my family, and I want to do it on a motorcycle - and I'm going to do it on the rivet.' The bike is covered in rivets to keep with the aircraft wing design. Although thse mockups show a one seater, the finished trike will have two. The firm says: 'Rivet is a type of vehicle we call 'Landjet'. Designed from the ground up as a 3 wheeled vehicle, with its exposed cockpit and command centre, seating fit only for a captain and the harmonious roar of its brute V8, piloting it gives you the feeling of flying on the open road. Rivet's intent is not only to draw attention to the pilot or the vehicle itself, but to the art and craft of hand built machines, done in the spirit of keeping America's 'routes' alive. The B-17 was primarily employed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets.

Hairs grow out of follicles, pass through the epidermis, and exit at the surface of the skin. Q: What is the middle layer that hair pass through before exiting at the surface of the skin? Choices: - epithelial tissue - cuticle - dermis - epidermis A: Answer:","output":"The middle layer that hair passes through before exiting at the surface of the skin is the epidermis. To better understand this, let us delve deeper into the structure of the skin and the growth of hair. The skin is the largest organ of the human body, and it consists of three primary layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis (subcutaneous layer). 1. Epidermis: The outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis is primarily composed of epithelial cells called keratinocytes. This layer consists of several sub-layers, including the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The epidermis plays a vital role in protecting the body from external factors and contributes to the process of hair growth. 2. Dermis: Situated just beneath the epidermis, the dermis is a thicker, more robust layer of connective tissue. It contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, and other structures that support the skin's functions. Collagen and elastin fibers provide the dermis with strength and flexibility. 3. Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Layer): The innermost layer of the skin, the hypodermis, is composed mainly of adipose tissue (fat cells). It helps to insulate the body, store energy, and protect the internal organs. Hair follicles, as mentioned in the paragraph, are the structures from which hairs originate. Hair growth occurs in three stages: anagen (active growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). During the anagen phase, hair cells actively divide and push the hair shaft upward through the hair follicle. As hair grows out of the follicle, it passes through the epidermis, which acts as the middle layer. The hair shaft comprises three layers: the cuticle (outermost layer), the cortex (middle layer), and the medulla (innermost layer). While the cuticle is part of the hair structure itself, it is not the middle layer through which hair passes before exiting at the skin's surface, as indicated in the choices provided. In conclusion, the epidermis serves as the middle layer through which hair passes before emerging at the skin's surface, as it constitutes a key component of the skin and plays an essential role in the process of hair growth."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Fertilization of gametes produces something that becomes an embryo, and ask you the question \\"fertilization of gametes products something that becomes what?\\", is the correct answer \\"flowers\\"?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When people talk about classical music enhancing cognitive abilities and productivity, they are usually referring to the so-called \\"Mozart Effect.\\" This term was coined after a study in 1993, which found that participants who listened to Mozart's music experienced a temporary increase in their spatial-temporal abilities. Since then, numerous studies have explored the relationship between classical music and brain function. It's true that some of these studies have suggested that listening to classical music can lead to improvements in concentration, memory, and problem-solving. However, other studies have failed to replicate these findings or have even suggested that any benefits observed may be due to an overall increase in arousal or attention, rather than specifically to classical music. Despite the conflicting evidence, many people still believe that there is a strong association between classical music and cognitive enhancement. In conclusion, the answer to your question is yes, listening to classical music can indeed improve cognitive function and increase productivity for some individuals. However, it's important to note that the efficacy of this practice may vary depending on personal preference, type of task being performed, and other factors."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Hundreds of hotels have sprung up along the sandy beaches, and these have been followed by restaurants, bars, and shops, making today's Sharm El-Sheikh not just a diving destination but a true tourist resort.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Sharm El-Sheikh has transformed from just a diving destination to a real tourist resort.\\"?","output":"If the premise is true, it means that many hotels, restaurants, bars, and shops have been built near the beaches of Sharm El-Sheikh.

Movie plot: CONTIENE SPOILERS La película trata la historia de dos atracadores y ladrones de coches (el Mini y el Meca), que conocen a una chica (Ángela). Planean nuevos atracos para los que necesitan otro miembro en su pequeña banda, así que introducen en el grupo a un conocido de ellos (el Sebas). También se relacionan con una amiga de Ángela, María, pero que no participa en los atracos. En los atracos, Ángela participa disfrazada de varón. La película retrata el modus vivendi de los delincuentes, el consumo de drogas, su relación con la policía (como cuando pasean por el Cerro de los Ángeles en Getafe y les piden la documentación y se tienen que deshacer de la droga que llevan encima). De día duermen, cometen algún atraco con el que vivir y comprar droga, y por la noche, van a la discoteca a bailar y drogarse. No tienen responsabilidades, así que si en medio de un colocón de droga les apetece coger el coche y recorrer 500 Km para ir a la playa, lo hacen. Tampoco les importa conducir drogados o mientras fuman porros. El coche no es suyo, ya que es robado, el dinero que se gastan también es robado. Y si se les acaba, siempre pueden robar de nuevo. Cuando no están drogados y tienen dinero, pueden parecer unos chicos normales que sólo quieren divertirse. Por ejemplo, salen a dar un paseo montados a caballo por el barrio de Villaverde Alto (de donde son originarios los actores en la vida real). Les advierten de que tengan cuidado con los caballos y de que no crucen la carretera con ellos. Y eso prometen, pero en cuanto están drogados, nada les importa, ni siquiera que se les escapen los caballos que les han prestado.

Translate to English.","output":"In most provinces, it is considered that landfill sites are unacceptable. In the majority of provinces, the concept of landfill sites is deemed unacceptable. Landfill sites, also known as dumps, are facilities designated for the disposal of waste materials. They are commonly used around the world to manage municipal solid waste, which includes household waste, construction debris, and commercial waste products. Many jurisdictions have implemented waste management standards and regulations to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of these sites. There are several reasons that landfill sites might be considered unacceptable. These include concerns about pollution, negative impacts on local ecosystems, and effects on human health. These issues stem from the degradation of waste materials in landfill sites, which can produce toxic substances and greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide. Groundwater contamination is another potential issue, as toxic substances can leach into the soil and water sources over time. Landfill sites also produce unpleasant odors and can attract pests such as flies, rodents, and scavenger birds, potentially harming the balance of the local ecosystem. In addition to the environmental impacts, landfills can also pose significant health risks to nearby communities through toxic waste, air quality degradation, and water pollution. As a result, many provinces have started implementing more sustainable waste management practices, including recycling and composting programs to reduce the dependence on landfill sites. Consequently, the growing awareness of the negative effects of landfill sites has led many provincial governments and municipalities to search for more environmentally friendly alternatives. These alternatives can comprise waste reduction programs, recycling initiatives, and waste-to-energy conversion projects. Emphasis is placed on adhering to the principles of the waste management hierarchy, which prioritizes waste prevention, waste reuse, recycling, and recovery, with landfill disposal as a last resort. In conclusion, the sentiment that landfill sites are unacceptable in most provinces stems from concerns about the harmful environmental and health effects associated with these waste disposal facilities. As a result, efforts are being made to explore and implement alternative waste management methods that have a lesser impact on the environment while still addressing the issue of waste disposal effectively."},{"instruction":"Renewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work.

From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Germanic states based their money on silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"2 young people standing on a highway.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The young people are standing outside.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the given information and analyze the hypothesis. Premise: \\"2 young people standing on a highway.\\" This premise provides us with the following information: 1. There are two young people. 2. They are standing on a highway. Hypothesis: \\"The young people are standing outside.\\" The hypothesis states that the young people are standing outside. Now, let's evaluate if this can be logically derived from the premise. Highways are typically outdoor structures, as they are large roads designed for fast-moving traffic. They are built outside, unlike tunnels or indoor pathways. Therefore, if the young people are standing on a highway, it is reasonable to assume that they are standing outside. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it is a logical inference that if the young people are standing on a highway, they are standing outside."},{"instruction":"Write a question you would see in a school textbook.","output":"Step 1: Choose a subject I will choose the subject of mathematics because it is a fundamental discipline taught in schools.

If there are 8 slices in a large pizza, how many slices will remain if Mary orders 2 large pizzas and eats 7 slices?","output":"Step 1: Determine the total number of slices in 2 large pizzas. Since there are 8 slices in a large pizza, we multiply the number of large pizzas by the number of slices per pizza. Total slices = 2 large pizzas × 8 slices per pizza Step 2: Calculate the remaining slices after Mary eats 7 slices. We subtract the number of slices Mary eats from the total number of slices calculated in Step 1. Remaining slices = Total slices - Mary's eaten slices Now, let's calculate the final answer: Step 1: Total slices = 2 large pizzas × 8 slices per pizza = 16 slices Step 2: Remaining slices = 16 slices - 7 slices = 9 slices The final answer is that there will be 9 slices remaining after Mary eats 7 slices."},{"instruction":"- Traitent les dossiers; Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Step 1: Identify the language of the given text.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin.

I was six when my grandfather died. A few months before he died, he gave me a beautiful blue and white blanket . I loved the blanket very much because it made me think of my grandfather. But after a few years, the blanket didn't look very good. It had holes and was dirty. I didn't want to throw the blanket away, so my mother made the blanket into a book bag.

This dough does not work easily. Work the raisins into the dough. Pick your answer from: a. different meanings; b. the same meaning;","output":"a. different meanings In these two sentences, the word \\"work\\" is used to convey different meanings. Let's break down the sentences to understand this better. 1. This dough does not work easily: In this sentence, \\"work\\" is used to denote the ease with which the dough can be manipulated or handled. When we say, \\"the dough does not work easily,\\" it implies that the dough is difficult to shape or mold. The word \\"work\\" here refers to the dough's ability to perform well or cooperate smoothly in the given context - dough preparation or handling. 2. Work the raisins into the dough: In the second sentence, \\"work\\" acts as a verb, instructing the person to incorporate the raisins into the dough. The meaning of \\"work\\" here is to physically mix, manipulate, or knead the raisins into the dough to ensure they are evenly distributed. The focus in this context is on the action to be performed, not the ease or difficulty of the task.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art., what would be the answer ?

A television set filled with 8 lb. of TNT had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 were missing and presumed dead. Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man called Redendo Cain Dellosa admitted to planting the bomb for Abu Sayyaf. Six suspects were arrested in connection with the bombing while the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were killed. Question: How many people survived the terrorist attack on the Superferry 14?

Both were too large to fit standard router bits when the compression nut was in place. I had grind the hardened steel collets on a lathe ( to avoid unbalancing the rapidly turning bits) to fit. The second problem I found was that the system that controls the depth of bits is sprung to high. This makes it difficult to extend the bits without using excessive force to compress the springs. The adjustment knob, usefull for fine adjustments, also requires excessive force to turn when the springs are near full compression. Because the knob compresses only one side it will jam pulling the router out of alignment. This makes it difficult to use in a table. The final major complaint is the collet doesnot extend far enough for some short router bits. In summary inexpesive but beware of its limitations.

On the other hand, the hypothesis implies that the rule does not have any genuine impact, with no significant variations or exceptions. To analyze this contradiction further, we can break down both statements and compare their implications: Premise: The impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution. - There are different types of businesses, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and service providers. - The production and distribution chain can be understood as a sequence of stages, from producing a good or service to distributing and selling it to the end customer. - The rule in question, according to this premise, has differing effects on businesses depending on their type and position within this chain. - This implies that there are varying degrees of impact (e.g., high impact on manufacturers but low impact on retailers) or different consequences (e.g., the rule might affect pricing strategies for wholesalers but labor practices for manufacturers). Hypothesis: This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances. - The impact of the rule is minimal or nonexistent, suggesting that it does not significantly affect the way businesses in the chain of production and distribution operate. - There are no real exceptions or variances, meaning that the rule consistently has little to no effect across all types of businesses and their positions within the production and distribution chain. - This implies that the rule does not play a meaningful role in influencing business operations, strategies, or overall outcomes for any organization. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the premise and the hypothesis present opposing perspectives on the impact of the rule. If the premise is assumed to be true, it would indicate that the rule has a range of effects on businesses depending on their type and place in the production and distribution process. In contrast, the hypothesis claims the rule has minimal to no impact across the board, with no significant variations. Consequently, since both statements cannot be accurate simultaneously, the truth of the premise would negate the validity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Background: Feeder are a Welsh rock band formed in Newport, Wales. They have released ten studio albums, twelve compilations, four EPs, and 40 singles. They have spent a total of 182 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2017, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. At their peak of commercial success, Feeder won two Kerrang! Context: For 1999's Yesterday Went Too Soon, the band decided to self-produce the album, brought in Matt Sime for engineering duties and had the album mixed in New York by Andy Wallace. \\"Dry\\" was re-recorded as a full band version after the original acoustic version appeared on \\"Suffocate\\" as a b-side. That single's b-sides featured tracks from the sessions for that album, therefore revealing what sort of direction it would take on. The working title for the album was originally A Life Through Headphones, and was originally set to be a double album. The name change was due to former Take That singer Robbie Williams releasing his solo debut album Life Thru a Lens, with the band not wanting to be compared to him. When the album was released, the band's reputation was on the rise and it entered the UK albums chart at number eight, which was at the time an unexpected chart position for the band. Before that, the band had released the album's first single, \\"Day In Day Out\\", in March 1999 which charted at #31 followed by \\"Insomnia\\" at #22, resulting in their first appearance on Top of the Pops. A week before the album's release, the band played the main stage of the Reading and Leeds festivals, while the title track from the album was at #20 in the singles chart. The album was then released on 30 August 1999. Only one single was lifted from the album after its release, in which a re-recorded version of \\"Paperfaces\\" charted at #41. Some of the album's lyrical themes were derived from Grant's personal perspective of working in a menial supermarket job on a daily basis (\\"Day in Day Out\\"), his experiences after gigs on their US tour (\\"Insomnia\\" and \\"You're My Evergreen\\"), past relationships (the title track and \\"Dry\\"), the music industry (\\"Hole in My Head\\") and \\"fear of commitment in relationships\\" (\\"Anaesthetic\\") amongst others. Musically, the album employed an indie rock feel to it, which also featured extended appearances of an acoustic guitar on some of its tracks. The album was due for release in June, but this was delayed until August to include material written after its completion which the band felt was too good to leave off. Upon its release, the UK music press immediately warmed to the album, which also received Melody Maker 's Album of the Week accolade. The year ended with the band providing support for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena and Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium. As of March 2003, the album has been certified gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK, with total counter sales standing at 110,000 as of February 2005. The album was Melody Maker's #24 album of 1999, while Metal Hammer placed the album in at #6 and Kerrang! ranked it at #16. Question: Who produced the album?.

The key elements of the claim are \\"The Dead Sea\\" and \\"Moses.\\" Step 2: Assess the plausibility of the claim. The Dead Sea is a famous body of water located between Jordan and Israel. Moses is a major figure in biblical history, specifically the Old Testament, and he is associated with leading the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their journey through the desert. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the key elements within the context. During the Israelites' journey, they are said to have passed through several locations around the Dead Sea, including the Plains of Moab and the area of Mount Nebo, which offers a view of the Promised Land. Moses, as the leader of the Israelites, would have been among the people who passed by the Dead Sea in those accounts. Step 4: Determine if the claim can be verified by human common sense without a web search. The claim appears to be based on biblical accounts, which are a primary source of information about Moses and the Israelites' journey. Although the historical accuracy of these accounts can be debated, they provide a basis for the claim that Moses was among the \\"many passers\\" of the Dead Sea.

This will help get off some of the dampness and will keep him from feeling like you're trapping him in a wet enclosure. Just gently blotting his face, body, and fur can make your kitty feel a bit more relaxed before you place him in a towel. Some people even use hair dryers on the lowest setting to help dry their kittens. You have to do what works best for your cat. Some are fascinated by the dryer and some are are terrified of it. If your kitty is okay with the hairdryer, then place it on the lowest heat setting and gently dry his fur just as you would with your hair, only taking a bit more care not to scare your kitty or harm him. Once you manage this, you should quickly dry the cat to get most of the dampness off. Be aware that small animals can lose a great deal of body temperature through damp fur so dry the kitten as much as possible, before providing a heat source for him/her to dry in front of. The towel may make the kitty feel a little claustrophobic and he may panic a little, but it's important to dry him off as much as you can. Your kitty will likely also shake the water off himself, like a dog. If you have a long-haired kitty, then you should brush his fur after the bath to get rid of any tangles that maybe have been caused by the bath. Afterwards, offer treats, cuddles, hugs, and kisses. Your poor baby has just experienced one of the worst things it can. Most cats hate water! (However, two exceptions are the Turkish Van, and Bengal breeds.) Even if your kitty will get used to the baths, the initial experience is likely to have been a bit upsetting, and you should acknowledge that.

I'll explain how to use shaving cream in a simple way, like a fun little story. So, here we go: Using shaving cream is like making a fluffy cloud on your face to help a razor slide smoothly, like a car on a slippery road, and cut off the tiny hairs. To use shaving cream, follow these easy steps: 1. First, make your face all wet and warm like after taking a bath. This helps to soften the hairs, making them easy for shaving. You can do this by splashing warm water on your face. 2. Now, it's time to make that fluffy cloud! Shake the can of shaving cream and press the nozzle. You'll see a little blob of shaving cream come out, just like whipped cream! Make sure to get enough, like the size of a golf ball, on your hand. 3. Rub your hands together and spread the shaving cream all over the place you want to shave, like your cheeks, chin, and neck if you are an adult getting rid of facial hairs. It should look like you have a soft, fluffy beard made of clouds. 4. Once you've got that cloud beard, you can grab your razor and start gently sliding it over your face, going along the direction of how hairs grow. The shaving cream makes the ride smooth, so the razor won't hurt your skin when it's cutting the hairs. 5. After you've carefully shaved all the areas, you can wash off the shaving cream with water. And just like that, you'll have a fresh and clean face, ready for the day! Remember, when you grow up and need to shave, always be cautious and ask for help from an adult if you're not sure. Shaving can be easy with the right steps and some practice!"},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Thursday the agency paid more to get into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters than he will make in the remaining seven years and four months he has in his job. The Apple logo is pictured at its flagship retail store in San Francisco, California January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith According to figures from the FBI and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Comey’s annual salary as of January 2015 was 183,300. Without a raise or bonus, Comey will make 1.34 million over the remainder of his job. That suggests the FBI paid the largest ever publicized fee for a hacking job, easily surpassing the 1 million paid by U.S. information security company Zerodium to break into phones. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in London, Comey was asked by a moderator how much the FBI paid for the software that eventually broke into the iPhone. “A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure,” Comey said. “But it was, in my view, worth it.” The Justice Department said in March it had unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone with the help of an unidentified third party and dropped its case against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), ending a high-stakes legal clash but leaving the broader fight over encryption unresolved. Comey said the FBI will be able to use software used on the San Bernardino phone on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software. There are about 10 million 5C iPhones in use in the United States, according to estimates from research firm IHS Technology. Eighty-four percent of iOS devices overall are running iOS 9 software, according to Apple. The FBI gained access to the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 2. The case raised the debate over whether technology companies’ encryption technologies protect privacy or endanger the public by blocking law enforcement access to information. (This version was officially corrected to change active U.S. 5C iPhone estimates to 10 million from 16 million in paragraph 8 after analyst IHS corrects figure.) ||||| FBI Director James Comey suggested Thursday that the bureau paid more than 1 million to access an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, the first time the agency has offered a possible price tag in the high-profile case. While speaking at a security forum in London hosted by the Aspen Institute, Comey would not offer a precise dollar figure, saying only that it cost “a lot” to get into the phone. He said the cost of the tool was “more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.” As he made his remark, Comey, a former federal prosecutor who speaks precisely in public settings, paused as if to consider the math he was performing in his head. The FBI director serves a 10-year term, though Comey’s predecessor, Robert S. Mueller III, served for 12 years after Congress approved a request from President Obama to extend his tenure. Comey was confirmed July 2013 and took office in September of that year, so he has more than seven years left in his term. According to the federal statute detailing his salary, Comey is paid the rate set for Level II of the executive salary schedule. That means he makes 185,100 a year, under the pay schedules that went into effect this year. As a result, Comey’s remarks strongly implied that the bureau paid at least 1.3 million to get onto the phone, which had belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, killed 14 people during the Dec. 2 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. “But it was, in my view, worth it,” the FBI director said of what it cost to access the phone’s data. [The San Bernardino case is already changing Apple’s arguments over another locked iPhone] An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on Comey’s remarks. Federal authorities have not publicly revealed who helped the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, which was at the center of an extended fight between the government and Apple. The Justice Department had maintained that only Apple could help it access the phone without erasing all of its data before abruptly saying it had gotten help from an outside party and no longer needed Apple’s assistance. According to people familiar with the issue, the FBI cracked the phone with the help of professional hackers who were paid a one-time flat fee. Law enforcement officials have said recently that the FBI has found no links to foreign terrorists on the phone, though they are still hoping that geolocation data on the device could help reveal what the attackers did during an 18-minute period after the shooting. Earlier this month, Comey had said that the government was considering telling Apple how it accessed the phone, though he acknowledged that if that happened, the technology giant would fix the flaw and close off that avenue. But he said the tool would only work on a “narrow slice” of devices, saying he was “pretty confident” it would not work on newer models. Comey conceded Thursday that the tool would work only on an iPhone 5c running iOS 9. In part because of the price tag, Comey said he hoped the government could figure out a solution to access other, more current phones without having to make mass appeals to the tech industry for some kind of hack. He noted that there were 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that might want to access phones and could not afford what the FBI paid to access the San Bernardino phone. The FBI’s total budget for fiscal year 2016 was more than 8.7 billion, and the bureau requested more than 9.5 billion for fiscal year 2017. “I’m hoping that we can somehow get to a place where we have a sensible solution, or set of solutions, that doesn’t involve hacking, it doesn’t involve spending tons of money in a way that’s un-scaleable,” Comey said. Further reading: Justice Dept. still wants to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case The FBI has weighed whether the San Bernardino tool can help state and local law enforcement The Justice Department said tech companies have accessed phones for it before. So the ACLU tried to find all the cases. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named James Comey is in charge of the FBI. The FBI needed help to get information from a locked iPhone that belonged to a man who did something very bad. The FBI paid a lot of money to people who know how to unlock iPhones. They paid so much money that it was more than what James Comey earns in more than seven years. Eventually, the iPhone was unlocked and they got the information they needed. This was important, but it cost a lot of money. So now, they are looking for a better way to unlock iPhones in the future without spending so much."},{"instruction":"Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections.

Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you access the ocean from the great lakes?","output":"Yes, you can access the ocean from the Great Lakes. The waterway mentioned connects the inland port of Duluth on Lake Superior, which is part of the Great Lakes system, to the Atlantic Ocean. The total distance of this waterway is 2,340 miles (3,770 km), allowing the passage of ships between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, the waterway also extends to Chicago on Lake Michigan, with a distance of 2,250 miles (3,620 km). This connection is made possible by a network of canals, locks, and channels that have been constructed to facilitate shipping between the Great Lakes Basin and the Atlantic Ocean. Key components of this network include the Welland Canal, which bypasses the Niagara Falls between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is a series of canals and locks that enable navigation between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Ocean. The St. Lawrence Seaway, in particular, plays a crucial role in connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. Inaugurated in 1959, the seaway is jointly managed by Canada and the United States, and it has facilitated the movement of millions of tons of cargo between the lake ports and global markets. In summary, the waterway system connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean allows for navigation and access between these two major water bodies.

Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles. - Clothing (also called clothes and attire) is fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of nearly all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing types can be gender-specific. - The term living statue refers to a street artist who poses like a statue or mannequin , usually with realistic statue - like makeup , sometimes for hours at a time . Living statue performers can fool passersby and a number of hidden camera shows on television have used living statues to startle people . As with all performing arts , living statue performers may perform as buskers . - A craft is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly as pertinent to the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. The traditional terms \\"craftsman\\" and \\"craftswoman\\" are nowadays often replaced by \\"artisan\\" and rarely by \\"craftsperson\\" (craftspeople). - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast. - A statue is a sculpture representing one or more people or animals (including abstract concepts allegorically represented as people or animals), normally full-length, as opposed to a bust, and at least close to life-size, or larger. A small statue, usually small enough to be picked up, is called a statuette or figurine, while one that is more than twice life-size is called a colossal statue. - A figurine (a diminutive form of the word \\"figure\\") or statuette is a small statue that represents a human, deity or animal, or in practice a pair or small group of them. Figurines have been made in many media, with pottery, metal, wood, glass, and today plastic or resin the most significant. Ceramic figurines not made of porcelain are called terracottas in historical contexts. - First aid is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and/or promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing CPR while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut. First aid is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health. - Computer simulations reproduce the behavior of a system using a model. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions. - Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time. - Tracheal intubation, usually simply referred to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction. - A street artist is a person who creates their art or craft in public, most usually on streets, for monetary reward. Some artists also sell their art or craft. Artists include portrait artists, caricaturists, artists who replicate famous paintings on the street itself or on large canvases, hair braiders, friendship bracelet makers and many others. - A mannequin (also called a manikin, dummy, lay figure or dress form) is an often articulated doll used by artists, tailors, dressmakers, windowdressers and others especially to display or fit clothing. The term is also used for life-sized dolls with simulated airways used in the teaching of first aid, CPR, and advanced airway management skills such as tracheal intubation and for human figures used in computer simulation to model the behavior of the human body. During the 1950s, mannequins were used in nuclear tests to help show the effects of nuclear weapons on humans. - A dress form is a three-dimensional model of the torso used for fitting clothing that is being designed or sewed. When making a piece of clothing, it can be put on the dress form so one can see the fit and drape of the garment as it would appear on a body, and make adjustments or alterations. Dress forms come in all sizes and shapes for almost every article of clothing that can be made. Dress forms in standard clothing sizes are used to make patterns, while adjustable dress forms allow garments to be tailored to fit a specific individual. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. What is the relationship between 'living statue' and 'craft'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between a 'living statue' and 'craft' lies in the fact that a living statue is a form of street performance art, which requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. As a type of craft, living statue artists must develop and perfect their ability to pose like a statue or mannequin, maintain stillness for extended periods, and apply realistic statue-like makeup. They may also need to design and create their own costumes as part of their performance. Thus, the practice of being a living statue can be considered a craft due to the mastery of techniques and skills involved in this unique form of artistic expression."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Hélio Castroneves ENGINE Oldsmobile; Hélio Castroneves CHASSIS Dallara; Hélio Castroneves START 11.

Elliot Sperling, a specialist of Indian studies and the director of the Tibetan Studies program at Indiana University’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that \\"the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction.\\" He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century. He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because \\"Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus\\" and also that \\"China's intervening Ming dynasty ... had no control over Tibet.\\" He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \\"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.Josef Kolmaš, a sinologist, Tibetologist, and Professor of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, writes that it was during the Qing dynasty \\"that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government.\\" Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.P.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group. The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world. In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials. \\"Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?\\" Abubakar Shekau said. \\"They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.\\" Shekau slammed reports of their planned release. \\"We married them off. They are in their marital homes,\\" he said, chuckling. The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram. \\"We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,\\" he said of the negotiator. It wasn't clear when the video was made. Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said these assertions contradict those made in the group's talks with the Nigerian government. Omeri said the government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video. \\"We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,\\" Omeri said. \\"Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight.\\" Nigeria said officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby. The ceasefire deal announced on October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad. That day passed without any signs of the girls. Boko Haram a growing challenge. In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more \\"war, striking and killing with gun.\\" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead. Days later, the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria. Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about 9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said. For its part, Nigeria isn't backing down. It is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said Saturday. The military said its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two states in the northeast that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram. Officials are \\"studying\\" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said. Boko Haram, whose name translates to \\"Western education is sin\\" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state. The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government. As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children, and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

Step 2: Analyzing each option Option A - Competition: This is not a consequence of not being careful in fencing, but rather a natural part of engaging in the sport. Option B - Severe injuries: Not being careful in fencing can lead to accidents and, with the use of sharp and pointed weapons, can result in severe injuries. Option C - Fever: Fever is not directly related to the act of fencing and is not a consequence of not being careful in the sport. Option D - Perspiration: Perspiration occurs naturally during physical activities, and it is not a consequence of not being careful in fencing. Option E - Small cuts: While small cuts can happen in fencing, they are not as significant of a consequence as severe injuries in the context of not being careful.

Both sentences convey the same information but present it differently. While both statements convey the founding of the team, winning the two titles, and achieving the \\"double\\", the structure and order of the presented facts have been modified in each paraphrase to make them distinct yet similar in meaning. Here's an explanation: 1. Original statement: \\"The team founded in 1906 won the first American \`double\` when it took the National Association Football League and the American Cup title in 1912.\\" In this sentence, the main focus is on the team that was founded in 1906, and its winning of the first American \\"double\\". The information about the team winning both titles in the National Association Football League and the American Cup is situated at the end of the sentence. The structure of the sentence maintains a chronological order, as it begins with the founding of the team in 1906 and ends with its accomplishments in 1912. 2. Paraphrased statement: \\"The team, founded in 1906, took the first American \`double\` when in 1912 the National Association Football League and the American Cup won.\\" In this paraphrase, the information is presented differently. The founding year of the team is placed within commas, indicating that it is ancillary information. The focus is shifted to the team's achievement of the first American \\"double\\", with the mention of the National Association Football League and the American Cup titles, followed by the year 1912. This restructured sentence maintains the overall meaning but shifts the focal points in the sentence.

Article: Every artist knows in his heart that he is saying something to the public. Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it. Yet even they do not choose totally without thinking about the character of their subjects. If one painter chooses to paint a decaying leg and another a lake in moonlight, each of them is directing our attention to a certain aspect of the world . Each painter is telling us something, showing us something, emphasizing something - all of which means that, consciously or unconsciously, he is trying to teach us.

Hypothesis: St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral was inaugurated by a Pop from Egypt.","output":"Based on the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt. To reach this conclusion, let us first analyze the information provided in the context: 1. St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic church situated in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt. 2. The cathedral serves as the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. 3. Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church around the time the cathedral was built. 4. The cathedral was inaugurated by Pope Cyril VI in 1969. From points 1 and 2, it is clear that the cathedral is closely connected to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which is an Egyptian Christian tradition. Thus, the cathedral's location in Egypt, and it being the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, implies a strong link to Egyptian culture and religious leadership. Point 3 identifies Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria as the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church when the cathedral was constructed. In the Coptic Orthodox tradition, the Pope of Alexandria is the highest spiritual authority within the church. Since Alexandria is a city in Egypt, it can reasonably be assumed that Pope Cyril VI was an Egyptian leader within the church. Finally, point 4 confirms that Pope Cyril VI indeed inaugurated St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Combining this fact with the previous information, we can confidently conclude that the cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt – in this specific case, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria. Therefore, the hypothesis that St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt is accurate and supported by the context provided."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Context: Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.

Betty had the windows open last night, the wind last night it knocked the blind to the floor. The","output":"crash echoed throughout her small cottage, causing her to sit up abruptly in her bed, heart pounding in her chest. The room was awash in silvery moonlight, the pale beams casting eerie shadows on the walls. Betty's disheveled brown hair, tangled from the restless night, fell in front of her blue fearful eyes as she stared cautiously into the darkness. She blinked, trying to adjust to the dim surroundings, and her gaze fell upon the tumbled blind. Cautiously, Betty slipped from beneath the cozy warmth of her quilt and tiptoed over to the window. The night air swirled in around her, cold and crisp, as she peered out into the densely wooded background that surrounded her little home. The trees were swaying slowly, their limbs dancing in the moonlight. Betty's breath fogged the window, blurring the world outside with each exhale. Betty couldn't help but feel a shiver run down her spine. She sensed that there was something unusual about the night, something that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. The wind whispered softly, carrying secrets it refused to tell. Her heart began to beat faster, a rhythm of primal fear that drummed through her veins. As she moved to close the window, Betty noticed a flicker of movement from the corner of her eye. She froze in place, her gaze drawn to a figure standing at the edge of the woods, shrouded in the night like a phantom. The figure was tall and featureless, its head slightly tilted as if regarding her curiously. Instinctively, Betty's hand flew to her throat, her stomach twisting with a mixture of dread and fascination. The figure took a step closer and although Betty's mind screamed at her to flee, she remained rooted to the spot. She watched, her eyes widening as the moonlight revealed a pair of piercing green eyes staring at her, entreating her to come closer. Something about those eyes was eerily mesmerizing, and despite every fiber of her being telling her to shut the window and lock the door, it was too late. She inadvertently took a step towards the figure, her curiosity overriding her terror. Suddenly, a howl broke the silence of the night, its intensity shattering the spell that held Betty captive. She gasped in horror, forcefully shutting the window and catapulting herself back into the safety of her bed. Heart pounding deafeningly in her ears, she rubbed her eyes, wondering if she had been dreaming. When she peered out the window once more, the figure was gone. Betty spent the remainder of the night gripped by fear, jumping at every sound and shadow that played at the edge of her thoughts. As the first rays of morning light crept in through her window, she wondered if she had imagined it all. The haunting presence she had felt, the ethereal figure lurking at the edge of the woods - could any of it have been real? That morning, Betty decided to investigate her surroundings. As she traversed the edge of the woods, she discovered a set of mysterious footprints near the spot she'd seen the figure standing. Frightened by her discovery, she rushed home and found herself unable to shake the memory of those green eyes. Her earlier questions about reality and sanity became replaced with a burning desire to uncover the truths the night held, and each passing day brought with it a growing obsession to unravel the identity of her nocturnal visitor. What Betty did not know was that her encounter would be the start of a journey that would lead her down a path of ancient magic, forbidden love, and long-lost secrets. The wind that night had not only knocked the blind from her window, but also, inexorably, the course of her life, guiding her toward a destiny she could never have imagined. From that night on, Betty's life was forever changed: a new chapter began, as each darkness gave way to mysteries and strange encounters, propelling her into a realm where things that go bump in the night held startling truths, and where the boundaries separating the mundane from the magical no longer held sway."},{"instruction":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Can't able to publish post Hi whenever I try to publish a post I am getting failure message.

To provide a detailed analysis for the question, let's break down the contributing factors individually: 1. 100-degree fever: Mike was suffering from a high fever, which is a natural response of the body to fight off infections or other potential threats. A fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit is considered significant and can be the primary reason for causing discomfort and disturbing sleep. Elevated body temperature can lead to increased restlessness, sweating, and difficulty in finding a comfortable sleeping position. 2. Chills: The passage mentions that Mike experienced chills, which is a common symptom accompanying fever. Chills typically involve involuntary muscle contractions, making the person feel cold and shiver. This sensation can cause further discomfort and restlessness during the night, making it difficult for Mike to get a good night's sleep. 3. Pain everywhere: When Mike's entire body was in pain, finding a comfortable sleeping position or staying asleep would have been difficult. Pain can cause significant distress, interfere with one's ability to relax, and prevent the person from falling asleep or staying asleep for an extended duration. 4. Waking up twice: The combination of fever, chills, and pain could have led to Mike waking up multiple times during the night. Disrupted sleep patterns due to such interruptions would have made it even more challenging for Mike to get a good night's sleep and recover. Moreover, Mike's health was being supported with interventions such as vitamin C pills, Tylenol for fever reduction, and plenty of water to combat dehydration often associated with fever. Though these interventions aimed to alleviate the symptoms, Mike's body was still coping and fighting off the underlying issue. Despite the efforts of providing him with medical support, Mike's body was still working hard to recover, leaving him feeling sore and sleepy the following morning. Consequently, the combination of Mike's 100-degree fever, chills, body pain, and waking up multiple times during the night resulted in him being unable to get a good night's sleep."},{"instruction":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"Three men stand together smiling, while one is playing Guitar Hero and the others are enjoying a beverage.\\" if \\"Three men sit together smiling.\\"?","output":"As an AI, I would approach this task step by step.

It was the verdict of the US Central Intelligence Agency on Labour back in 1985, in a memo for the agency's director on the early phase of Neil Kinnock's leadership. This memo is one of millions of the CIA's historical records which have just been made available online. Previously researchers had to actually visit the US National Archives in Maryland in order to access this database of declassified documents. The records reveal the deep level of concern inside the CIA about the strength of the Left within Labour in the early 1980s, a political force which the agency regarded as anti-American. A report written in the run-up to the 1983 general election states that \\"a Labor majority government would represent the greatest threat to US interests\\". The agency was particularly worried by Labour's then policy of opposition to nuclear weapons, which included cancelling plans for the Trident submarine programme. This report was especially scathing about leading figures on the traditionally pro-nuclear Labour right who had compromised with this stance. It said that \\"most disheartening from the viewpoint of US interests\\" was the position of the party's deputy leader, Denis Healey. It reported that he still had ambitions to lead the party and as a result \\"he apparently has decided to appease the left by attacking US arms control policy, denouncing Trident, and denying he ever supported the NATO INF [Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] program\\". The report added that the growing power of the Left meant that \\"even moderates like Healey have been forced to ape anti-American rhetoric\\". Entitled \\"The British Labor Party: Caught between Ideology and Reality\\", the document is a detailed account of the balance of power between left and right in the party and trade unions, as seen by the CIA. It also records that leading Labour politicians had told US officials they did not take all of the party's policy programme seriously. The CIA was also concerned by what it saw as Europe's large centre-left and socialist parties (including Labour) being too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. One 1982 report concluded \\"We have long contended that Moscow's most effective allies in Western Europe are not the Communist Parties, but self-styled Social Democrats who have betrayed the original tenets of social democracy.\\" Another newly accessible document is a record of a 1981 meeting between delegations led by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Margaret Thatcher, who was on a prime ministerial visit to Washington. The meeting discussed the controversial American plans for an Enhanced Radiation Weapon (ERW), more commonly known as the \\"neutron bomb\\", a weapon which was said to be able to kill very large numbers of people while leaving buildings standing. Also present at the meeting was Mrs Thatcher's Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, who told the Americans that \\"it is considered unsporting in Europe for a weapon to kill people only\\". The database contains just two references to the current Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One noted his support in 1986 for an El Salvadoran trade union federation, Fenastras, which was linked to Marxist guerrillas during the country's civil war, while the Americans backed the military government. This is just a small immediate selection from millions of pages covering a wide range of American and international issues which reveal the CIA's analyses and preoccupations in the past. Records relating to more recent events have not yet been declassified. The CIA's decision to make all these documents searchable and accessible followed a legal case brought by MuckRock, a US organisation that promotes access to public records.","output":"A long time ago, in 1985, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was worried about a group called the Labour party in the United Kingdom. The CIA thought that this group had too much power and that they were not friendly towards America. Recently, a lot of old CIA documents, like this one, were put online so everybody can read them. These documents show some secrets from the past and help us understand what the CIA thought about different countries and people, like the Labour party."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Indiana University Health Ball Memorial Hospital was founded by five bothers whose names were?","output":"After extensive research, I could not find any information about the hospital being founded by five brothers.

Once the temperature reached hundred degree centigrade, he added more heat to it. He called this stage as stage C. Once all the water has turned into steam, he kept adding heat to it. He called this last stage of is experiment as stage D. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which stage the water would have more kinetic energy, stage A or stage B? The answer is:","output":"Stage B. In Stage A, John sealed some water in a container. At this point, the water molecules would have some kinetic energy due to their motion. However, as the temperature increases in Stage B, the water molecules would gain more kinetic energy. This is because when water is heated, the energy from the heat source is transferred to the water molecules, causing them to move faster. When the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the water molecules also increases as a result of the faster movement of the molecules at higher temperatures. This can be understood via the equation KE = 1/2 mv^2, where KE represents kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is the velocity of the molecules. As the velocity of the water molecules increases, the kinetic energy also increases. Thus, the water would have more kinetic energy in Stage B, as it is being heated, compared to Stage A, where it is just in a sealed container at room temperature."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Based on the book \\"Something Borrowed\\"Character History: Rachel is a just turned 30 lawyer who is very attractive, but down to earth, used to be overshadowed by her larger than life best friend since childhood - Darcy.

On the third Sunday in June, fathers all across the United States are given presents, treated to dinner or otherwise made to feel special. However, the idea for creating a day for children to honor their fathers began in Spokane, Washington. A woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909. Having been raised by her father, Henry Jackson Smart, after her mother died, Sonora wanted her father to know how special he was to her. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a selfless and loving man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910. In 1924 President Calvin Coolidge declared the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Roses are the Father's Day flowers: red to be worn for a living father and white if the father has died. When children can't visit their fathers or take them out to dinner, they send a greeting card. Traditionally, fathers prefer greeting cards that are not too sentimental(, ). Most greeting cards are too special so fathers laugh when they open them. Some give heartfelt thanks for being there whenever the child needed Dad.

The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Wesleyan University (or ) is a private liberal arts college in Middletown, Connecticut, founded in 1831.

Title: Quadrophenia Movie plot: The film, set in 1964, follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

(D). makes a city from stones..","output":"So, we are talking about what the little boy is going to do, right? Let's see, since the child is already bringing in water from the ocean and a woman is making sand castles, the boy might do something that fits with the beach theme. (A) Sounds possible - he could climb onto the sand castles, but it could tear them down, so it may not happen, because usually when we make sandcastles, we want to keep them, not crush them. (B) Helping to carry a sand castle out into the ocean doesn't quite fit. Sand castles don't really move, and the water would wash it away. (C) This makes sense - he pours a lot of water into the sand. When you're at the beach, you can use water from the ocean to make the sand wet, and that helps when you're building things like sand castles. (D) Making a city from stones is another good possibility, since there are often lots of stones at the beach. However, we didn't see anything about stones mentioned in paragraph.

Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Hint: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. The answer to this question is:","output":"Process B would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. The paragraph provides information about two processes, process A and process B, related to hormone secretion from different parts of the adrenal glands. Process A involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex. The cortex releases hormones such as cortisol (helps the body deal with stress) and aldosterone (regulates the balance of minerals in the body). Although cortisol helps the body handle stress, its primary effect is not on increasing oxygen and glucose supply to the muscles. Process B, on the other hand, involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla. The medulla secretes fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline, which prepares the body to respond to emergencies. Adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, allowing them to operate at a higher capacity and respond rapidly during emergency situations. Considering both processes, process B would cause more oxygen and glucose to be directed to the muscles as it directly involves the secretion of adrenaline, which is responsible for preparing the body for physical exertion and emergencies by increasing oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to French: After clean mineral oil is added to the transformers, these residual PCBs leach out of the contaminated materials into the clean oil.","output":"Étape 1: Analyser la phrase en anglais et identifier les mots clés importants à traduire.

Question: how old a child pedophile crime Answer:","output":"To answer the question, I will first provide context on the definition of pedophilia and how it relates to the age of the child involved in pedophile crimes. Pedophilia, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), is a \\"disorder of adult personality and behavior\\" characterized by a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age. In terms of age, prepubertal usually refers to children who have not yet entered puberty, which can range from under 10 years old to around 12 or 13 years old, depending on the child's individual development. Early pubertal age typically refers to the beginning stages of puberty, which can vary between individuals.

The Canadian Citizenship Act, also known as the Citizenship Act of 1946 or the Act of 1947, marked a significant milestone in the history of Canada and Canadian immigration. Prior to the enactment of this law, Canadian citizens were considered British subjects, and there was no unique Canadian citizenship. The Act aims to define Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it. The adoption of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947 was an important step towards Canada's evolution into an independent nation with its distinct national identity. The transition from British subject to Canadian citizen symbolized the country's growing autonomy from Great Britain. The Act established the criteria for obtaining Canadian citizenship, which included: 1. Birthright citizenship: Individuals born in Canada were automatically considered Canadian citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality. 2. Naturalization: Immigrants who had lived in Canada for a specific period (originally five years) could apply for Canadian citizenship. They had to demonstrate the knowledge of one of the two official languages (English or French), exhibit good character and understanding of Canadian rights and responsibilities, and pass a Citizenship exam. This made it more accessible to immigrants of various cultural and linguistic backgrounds. 3. Citizenship by descent: Children born to Canadian citizens outside of Canada could claim Canadian citizenship through their parental lineage. The Act also specified conditions under which an individual could lose their Canadian citizenship, such as fraud, revocation of naturalization, denaturalization, or through voluntary renunciation. Over the years, the Canadian Citizenship Act has gone through several amendments to address the changing needs and concerns of the Canadian population. Some of these revisions included the elimination of discriminatory clauses, the introduction of dual citizenship, the expansion of eligibility requirements, and the international adoption of children by Canadian citizens. Today, the Canadian Citizenship Act continues to serve as the foundation for defining Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it. This legislation symbolizes the unique Canadian identity and accentuates the nation's commitment to diversity, equality, and multiculturalism."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

A white van man has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite racing over a level crossing after the traffic lights had turned red. David Shackleford claims he did not have enough time to stop the vehicle after realising the lights had changed at the crossing in Foxton, Cambridgeshire, so decided it would be safer to speed over the tracks. The 28-year-old trainee truck driver was moments away from colliding with a train, but has been allowed to keep his licence after pleading with magistrates. The driver from Harrow, north west London, was fined £200 and given three points for the incident on January 15. After initially claiming he the lights were on amber, the driver admitted he ignored them after being sent images taken from CCTV footage which clearly show him in plain view of the red light. But Judge Ken Sheraton decided not to disqualify Shackleford, as it would put him out of work. 'I was driving at 40mph and it would have been unsafe for me to slam the breaks on. 'By the time the lights came into view it would have been silly for me to stop.' It is not the first time drivers have had a near miss with oncoming trains at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. In 2010 John McDonald, 38, ignored the flashing warning lights and accelerated his 44-tonne sewage truck over the crossing. The driver was filmed approaching the crossing while the lights are red despite claiming they were amber. Shacklefield accelerated over the train lines just moments before a train thundered by at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. The automatic barriers smashed as they crashed on top of the artic. Two years later Belal Ahmed, 32, was convicted of speeding under the dropping barriers in the BMW, and ten days after that Girish Babu, 31, stopped his Mercedes on the crossing, forcing the signalman to stop the barriers in mid-air. Sgt Andy Cook of British Transport Police said: 'Misusing level crossings is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by BTP. 'Drivers who ignore the warning lights and barriers don’t just risk their own lives, but also endanger other road users and rail passengers and staff.'","output":"David Shacklefield, a trainee truck driver, drove his white van over a level crossing when the traffic lights were red. He said there wasn't enough time to stop safely. He was very close to having a crash with a train. The judge allowed David to keep his driving license, but he had to pay £200 and he got three points on his license. This happened because a camera showed he clearly saw the red light but didn't stop. David is not the only one, three other drivers have ignored the lights at the same crossing in the past. The police say that drivers who ignore the warning lights are very dangerous and can hurt other people on the road or in trains."},{"instruction":"Результаты проекта публикуются после рабочих встреч.

Answer:","output":"The best answers that directly relate to the prompt \\"Lakes can increase due to\\" would be \\"storms\\", \\"watershed\\", and \\"flooding\\". Storms can greatly influence the water level in lakes. Heavy rainfall associated with storms can raise water levels in lakes. The increased amount of water falling into the lake directly adds to the lake's volume. Furthermore, wind-driven waves caused by storm can also push more water into the lake basin, contributing to a rise in the lake's level. The watershed, or the area of land that drains into a body of water such as a river, lake, wetland, or reservoir, contributes to a lake's water levels. Water from rain, snowmelt, or other sources flows downhill into these bodies of water, carrying additional water from the surrounding land. Thus, an increase in water input from the watershed causes lake levels to increase. Flooding can also cause lakes to increase in volume. Flooding occurs when large volumes of water overflow onto normally dry land. This can be driven by excessive rain, snowmelt, or even dam breakage. This excess water can end up in lakes, resulting in a significant rise in their water levels. The other choices given - wind, salinity, heat, nutrients, and lift - have less direct influence on lake level increases. Wind may cause waves and shift water within a lake but is less likely to significantly increase water volume. Salinity doesn't influence the volume of lakes but rather relates to the content of dissolved salts in water. Heat can induce evaporation, generally lowering the water level rather than increasing it. Nutrients affect the biological characteristics of the lake but not its volume. Lastly, lift generally refers to an upward force in scientific contexts, which doesn't directly contribute to more water in lakes. Therefore, based on the given options, storms, watershed, and flooding are the factors that can most directly cause lakes to increase in volume."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries.

Of Jewish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were \\"something good to eat.\\" She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with Ororo Munroe. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school. Their conversation was cut short when they (along with Wolverine and Colossus) were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them. She managed to contact Cyclops, Phoenix, and Nightcrawler. With the help of Dazzler and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club. The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents.

Context: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. Question: What is the average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy can vary significantly depending on the severity of the condition and factors such as associated medical complications and the quality of care the individual receives. Generally, individuals with milder forms of cerebral palsy can have a life expectancy similar to that of the general population, while those with more severe forms may experience a reduced life expectancy. As cerebral palsy is a spectrum disorder, it is important to note that every individual's situation is unique, and their life expectancy will depend on various factors such as the degree of motor impairment, cognitive functioning, and the presence of other health conditions. For some individuals, associated complications such as respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, ongoing muscle contractures, and pressure sores can contribute to a shorter life expectancy. Quality of care and early interventions can also play a significant role in the life expectancy of individuals with cerebral palsy. Access to advanced medical care, physical therapy, adaptive equipment, and a supportive social network can have a positive impact on the overall quality of life, helping to manage complications more effectively and promoting better overall health and well-being. In conclusion, the average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy varies significantly and depends on individual circumstances. However, it is essential to focus on promoting the quality of life and addressing health complications through comprehensive medical care, therapy, and social support in order to help individuals with cerebral palsy live their lives to the fullest."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Der Boulevard ist sein Revier: Reporter Ludo (Til Schweiger) ist mit Paparazzo Moritz (Matthias Schweighöfer) ständig auf der Jagd nach Stars, Starlets und Boxenludern.

Understand the variables: In this task, the integer i is 5 and the array A has 14 elements. 2. Determine the ith elements: Since i is 5, you need to find every 5th element of the array A starting with the 1st element. 3. Apply the guidelines: To find every 5th element in the array, take note of every element located at index (i*n)-1, where n is an integer in increasing order. This is because array indices start from 0, so subtracting 1 from the product of i and n will ensure the correct position of every ith element. 4. Calculate the answer: - For n = 1: (5*1)-1 = 4, so the 1st 5th element is '885'. - For n = 2: (5*2)-1 = 9, so the 2nd 5th element is 'z'. - From this point, to find the next 5th element, the index (5*3)-1 = 14 would exceed the size of the array. So there are no more 5th elements in the array. 5.

I referred to it as the most important movie I'd seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things. Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view. The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you weren't my brother so I could **** you!) Bernhards search for herself after returning to LA from New York, results in the immersive trying-on of various personas (all of which fit poorly) for our amusement, but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a \\"black imperative\\" values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her.

Children should not be given fizzy drinks because they contain dangerous amounts of sugar, UN health chiefs said yesterday. They also warned adults should halve their average intake to six teaspoons a day to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses. The guideline amount has been slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco. Experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year. Graham MacGregor, a London cardiologist and health campaigner, said: ‘Added sugar is a completely unnecessary part of our diets, contributing to obesity, type II diabetes and tooth decay. ‘We have known about the health risks of sugar for years and yet nothing substantial has been done. ‘The new recommendations will be a wakeup call to the Department of Health and the Government to take action by forcing the food industry to slowly reduce the huge amount of sugar added across the board.’ Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity. Labour suggested last night it would impose a maximum limit on sugar, fat and salt in products marketed at children. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. The UN’s World Health Organisation said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yoghurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. Last night it published the draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six. And it said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons. Francesco Branca, director for nutrition for health and development at WHO, said: ‘Obesity affects half a billion people in the world and it is on the rise. ‘Sugar along with other risk factors might certainly become the new tobacco in terms of public health action. The consumption of a single serving of sugar sweetened soda might actually already exceed the limit for a child. So certainly the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should be done with great care. ‘It actually is one of the elements that has been more constantly associated to increase weight gain particularly in children.’ The guidelines will now be discussed by academics and medical experts before a final version is published. But Dr Branca said food and drinks manufacturers should drastically alter their products. A bowl of muesli contains two and a half teaspoons of sugar, a latte has five, a chocolate bar six or seven while some ready-meals have more than eight. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party was considering setting a legal maximum on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children. ‘We have a big ambitious health policy coming out,’ he added. ‘We feel the Government has lost its way completely on public health, there’s no leadership at all now.’ It is understood the policy would cover products such as Kellogg’s Frosties, which is 37 per cent sugar. On Monday, Dame Sally told MPs that being overweight had become ‘normalised’. But David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday played down the need for a sugar tax and said ministers would rather encourage food and drinks firms to voluntarily make products healthier. Chief medical officer Sally Davies (left) said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity, while Andy Burnham (right) said Labour was considering setting a legal maximum on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children. Sweet tooth: Health experts are concerned about the 'hidden sugar' in sweets and sodas. He. added: ‘What we are doing is working with the industry. You have. already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce. levels of salt, to remove some artificial fats, to reduce calorie. content and improve labelling, as well as public health campaigns by. local authorities and the NHS.’ The draft guidelines do not address the health effects of sugar substitutes or chemical sweeteners. Andrew Percy, a Tory MP on the Commons health select committee, raised fears of ‘nanny state’ meddling. He. said: ‘What we need to do is educate people about food, and proper. labelling of food is important in that. But, in the end, people must. have the discretion to make their own choices.’ Professor MacGregor is a cardiologist at Barts and chairman of the group Action on Sugar. Write highlights for this article.","output":"The UN health chiefs suggest that people should eat less sugar every day, because too much sugar is bad for our health. It can lead to gaining too much weight, heart problems, and other illnesses. They say children shouldn't drink fizzy drinks, which have a lot of sugar. Instead, everyone should try to eat only six teaspoons of sugar a day. This warning is important to help both adults and children stay healthy. The UN also mentions that there is hidden sugar in many everyday foods and drinks, like yogurts, muesli, and sauces. Eating too much sugar may lead to more people being unhealthy in the future, which could cost a lot of money. This is a reminder for everyone to be careful about how much sugar they eat and to pay attention to what their food and drinks contain."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What do they call someone born of a parent who practiced witchcraft?

Movie title: The Craft Context: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\". To do so, she plans to \\"call the corners\\" by creating a fire on a beach, so that all four natural elements (earth, fire, air, and water) can be called upon by the four separate girls, to grant them further supernatural abilities.

These parties recognize the importance of not only gaining a majority in the Parliament, but also the mandate they need from the electorate to drive their policies forward. One such party, the Welsh Labour Party, is determined to ensure it secures the confidence of the Welsh public to carry its vision forward. Leading political analyst Nye Davies of Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre has been closely observing and assessing the Welsh Labour campaign and its constituent strategies. This article will present his insights and expert opinions on its progress. Two key areas will be discussed within this article: the primary issues Welsh Labour is prioritizing and the core messages the party is disseminating in its campaign. Furthermore, we will examine the strategy of Welsh Labour in contrast to the UK Labour Party, evaluating how they have tailored their approach to cater to the unique concerns of the Welsh electorate. Welsh Labour’s Primary Issues According to Nye Davies, Welsh Labour's campaign is primarily focused on three major issues: healthcare, education, and the economy. These areas, consistently topping the list of voters' concerns, are leading the agenda for Wales. 1. Healthcare: Welsh Labour is emphasizing the importance of a robust NHS in Wales. They have committed to fully funding the service and ensuring that people in Wales receive accessible and timely healthcare. In addition, they wish to foster an effective mental health service and invest in preventative healthcare measures. 2. Education: The need for quality education and its long-term impact on social mobility and economic growth underpins the party’s stance. They are pledging to invest in teachers, schools, and facilities to create the necessary opportunities for the personal and professional growth of the Welsh youth. 3. Economy: Welsh Labour intends to put forward policies that promote growth and job creation. Key focuses include infrastructure development, energy security, and fostering an ecosystem conducive to small businesses and entrepreneurship. Core Messages of the Welsh Labour Campaign Nye Davies highlights that the Welsh Labour campaign, led by First Minister Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour Leader Keir Starmer, is promoting the following core messages: 1. Putting Wales First: Welsh Labour is stressing that their decisions and actions as a party are firmly rooted in the best interests of the Welsh people. They emphasize that their representation in the UK Parliament will consistently strive to secure favorable negotiations and outcomes for Wales. 2. A United Front: Welsh Labour is positioning itself as the party with a clear plan for Wales. By drawing a cohesive, definitive vision for the future of the country, they aim to present themselves as the most reliable choice for the Welsh electorate in these uncertain times. 3. Continuity and Change: The party is attempting to strike a balance between continuity and change. They wish to build on the foundation established during their tenure in government, while remaining adaptive and open to new ideas that challenge the status quo and stimulate further growth for Wales. Welsh Labour and the UK Labour Party: A Tailored Approach Nye Davies observes that while the Welsh Labour campaign is aligned with the UK Labour Party in terms of ideology and priorities, they have effectively tailored their strategies for their unique target audience. Welsh Labour maintains its distinct identity by focusing on Welsh-specific issues and collaborating with grassroots campaigners to ensure localized concerns are addressed. Conclusion The Welsh Labour campaign for the general election demonstrates a clear understanding of the primary issues and concerns of the electorate. Nye Davies’ analysis sheds light on the Welsh Labour Party's emphasis on putting Wales first and addressing the critical sectors of healthcare, education, and the economy. Through a tailored approach that caters to the unique needs of the Welsh population, the party aims to secure the confidence and mandate necessary to drive their policies forward. As the election nears, it remains to be seen to what extent their campaign strategies will resonate with and mobilize voters to help them secure the seats they are hoping for in Parliament."},{"instruction":"bored and its raining Select your answer from the options.

Take some time to be by yourself and reflect on how the relationship feels in the moment. At a difficult family gathering, you can excuse yourself for a short walk around the block, or to make a phone call to a trusted friend. Before you see your mother-in-law, spend some time by yourself. You can use this time to reflect and relax so that you’ll have an easier time when you do see your mother-in-law. You may need to vent to a friend after spending time with your mother-in-law. Have someone on hand whom you can call if you need to. This step can seem drastic, but if your mother-in-law is truly abusive, moving may be the only viable option. Many couples do move based on proximity to in-laws. Living farther away can prevent meddling and unwanted visits. If your mother-in-law’s abuse affects your children, moving away can help assure their safety from her. You can choose whether you and your spouse will be honest about the reason for moving or not. Sometimes, a spouse isn’t willing or able to admit that their mother is abusive. This can cause a rift between partners, and sometimes causes the relationship to end. If your spouse can’t admit that their mother is abusive, offer to see a couple’s therapist together before deciding to end the marriage. Leaving a marriage is a big decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. However, you should never tolerate abuse in order to preserve a marriage. If your mother-in-law has caused trauma for you or your children, you may want to see a therapist even after your mother-in-law is out of your life. Abuse can take years to recover from, even when the abuser is no longer a threat. Even if your spouse doesn't see the abuse, you may still need to deal with its effects on you. Children can be affected by abuse even if they are not consciously aware of it. Make sure they have someone safe to talk to if they've been exposed to abusive behavior.","output":"The article suggests taking time for oneself and reflecting on the relationship with a mother-in-law, especially during difficult family gatherings.

Answer:","output":"The Clydesdale horse is a breed of draft horse that originated from the Clydesdale district in Lanarkshire, Scotland. These horses are renowned for their strength, size, and eye-catching appearance, which make them ideal for various purposes, including agricultural work, parades, and promotional events. They are characterized by their large size, with males typically standing between 16.2 to 18 hands high (66 to 72 inches) and females ranging from 16 to 17 hands high (64 to 68 inches). Clydesdales possess a well-muscled body, a long neck, and powerful legs with dense feathering, which gives them a distinct appeal. One of the most famous uses of Clydesdale horses is by the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, specifically for promotions related to their Budweiser beer brand. The association began in 1933 when August A. Busch Jr. and Adolphus Busch III gifted their father, August A. Busch Sr., with a six-horse Clydesdale hitch to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition. The appearance of these majestic horses was a hit, and they soon became an integral part of the Budweiser brand image. The Clydesdales made their first public appearance in a parade to celebrate the repeal, and since then, they have become a popular representation of the Budweiser brand, making appearances at numerous events each year. The Budweiser Clydesdales have become so iconic that the company maintains a stable of around 250 horses, distributed among multiple teams across the United States, ensuring that they remain available for appearances and events. They have been featured in numerous advertising campaigns over the years and have become synonymous with Budweiser's image. In 2019, the company celebrated the 85th anniversary of the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales. Some of the Budweiser Clydesdales' notable promotional appearances include the annual Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, presidential inaugurations, and sporting events, such as the Super Bowl.

What is a lever arm (physics)? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Hello little buddy! Let's talk about lever arms. 1. Does every object have a lever arm? Every object doesn't exactly have a lever arm, but you can use a lever arm with almost any object. Let's say you want to lift a big rock. If you use a long stick and put it under the rock with one end on the ground, you can push down on the other end to lift the rock. The stick acts like a lever, and the distance from the rock to the end you push on is the lever arm. The longer the lever arm, the easier it is to lift the rock. 2. What is a lever arm (physics)? A lever arm is like a helper in physics. Think of a see-saw, where two kids sit on opposite ends and go up and down. The lever arm is the distance from the center (where the see-saw balances on) to where the kids sit. The longer the lever arm, the more help it gives to move something. Remember the lifting rock example? The long stick was like a see-saw, and the lever arm helped you lift the rock! 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? These questions are related but not the same. The first question asks if every object has a lever arm, while the second question asks for the meaning of a lever arm in physics. Now you know that objects don't have lever arms, but you can use lever arms with objects to make things easier to move!"},{"instruction":"On Monday a group of 7 children and 5 adults went to the zoo.

Convinced that she's being haunted by something sinister, she is forced to confront her deepest fears in her search for safety. Taking refuge in a seemingly abandoned chapel, she soon discovers that the sanctuary she is seeking may be harboring secrets darker than her own. As Arlette unravels the chapel's haunting history, she must face her own demons and reconcile with her past in order to escape the darkness that threatens to destroy her. Act 1: Arlette is living an ordinary life as an artist in a small town, constantly striving for a breakthrough. She is haunted by her past, including her fractured relationship with her sister, Elise. When she begins experiencing eerie occurrences in her house, she wonders if her past is finally catching up to her. These events escalate to the point where she no longer feels safe in her own home. Act 2: On the verge of a breakdown and desperate for a secure haven, Arlette ventures out during a storm and stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned chapel. As she takes shelter, she quickly finds signs that suggest she's not alone; she feels an inexplicable sense of connection to the chapel and its mysterious history. She discovers that the chapel once served as an asylum for the mentally ill, where unspeakable acts had occurred. Arlette's encounters with the supernatural intensify as she explores the chapel. During this time, she begins to have visions of Mary, a woman once held captive in the asylum, who seeks justice and solace for her suffering. The line between reality and delusion grows blurred, and Arlette is guided deeper into the past by her connection with Mary. Act 3: As the truth is gradually revealed, Arlette realizes that the malevolent force that hounds her is a manifestation of her unresolved guilt and trauma stemming from her turbulent past. Mary, a mirror of her own inner torment, serves as a symbol of redemption. Elise unexpectedly arrives at the chapel, determined to help her sister face her demons and rebuild their fractured relationship. The climax of the story sees Arlette confronted with the apparition on a stormy night. With Elise's support, she musters the courage to face her fears, embrace her past, and forgive herself. By doing so, she ultimately liberates both herself and Mary from their torment. In the final scene, the sisters reconcile and leave the chapel together, finally at peace with their past. The abandoned chapel, having served its purpose, finally succumbs to the ravages of time and nature, allowing new life to take root in its place."},{"instruction":"Proboha mlč!

She is married to Gordon Wink (Richard Steinmetz), a detective with the LAPD, with whom we see some flashbacks of their relationship. Fairfax (Charles M. Huber), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting Shakespeare, is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow \\"shift the balance of power in the world.\\" It is not in any way explained how these devices will achieve this, other than mention that it is involved with satellite tracking, that a whole city could be destroyed and a Third World country is in danger. Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices. Carrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfaxâs goons to the site of one of their exchanges. The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device. Carrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller). She takes them to the Zitex building, where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor.

As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout.

However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie. His elder brother, Jack, initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United. His other brother, Tommy, plays walking football for the Mature Millers club in Rotherham. On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by Manchester United chief scout Joe Armstrong. Charlton went on to play for England Schoolboys and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with Wilf McGuinness, also aged 15. Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer; however, he went on to turn professional in October 1954. Charlton became one of the famed Busby Babes, the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at Old Trafford in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the Second World War. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against Charlton Athletic in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his National service with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Shrewsbury, where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United teammate Duncan Edwards. Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5-1 away win over Charlton Athletic in the February. United won the league championship but were denied the 20th century's first \\"double\\" when they controversially lost the 1957 FA Cup Final to Aston Villa. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper Ray Wood carried off with a broken cheekbone after a clash with Villa centre forward Peter McParland. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate Jackie Blanchflower who ended up between the posts. Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the European Cup. Previously, the Football Association had scorned the competition, but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders Real Madrid. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play Red Star Belgrade. In the first leg at home, United won 2-1. The return in Yugoslavia saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3-0 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3-3 draw. However, United maintained their aggregate lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against Wolves at the weekend.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"To determine if the Louvre is in billionaire George Soros's price range, we should consider the following factors: 1. Estimated value of the Louvre: This is difficult to accurately determine since it's not merely a structure but a world-famous art museum housing historic art pieces. However, we can roughly estimate its value based on a combination of its infrastructure, real estate location, and the priceless art collection it maintains. 2. George Soros's net worth: As of September 2021, according to Forbes, George Soros has an estimated net worth of 8.6 billion. Now, let's analyze these factors: 1. Estimating the value of Louvre's art collection is challenging due to its unique nature. The Louvre houses many iconic pieces, such as the Mona Lisa, which alone is considered invaluable by art experts. Even a conservative estimate would place the value of the Louvre's entire collection in the tens of billions of dollars. 2. The infrastructure and location of the Louvre are also significant. The historic palace itself and the prime location in the heart of Paris would add billions of dollars to its value. Considering the Louvre's immense value in terms of its art collection, infrastructure, and location, it is highly unlikely that even a billionaire like George Soros would be able to purchase it outright. Additionally, acquiring a national treasure like the Louvre is not a simple transaction, as it holds immense cultural and historical significance to France. In conclusion, while George Soros is incredibly wealthy, the Louvre's value surpasses his net worth, and it would likely not be possible for him to purchase it even if it were for sale."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La belleza de la naturaleza es un espectáculo sorprendente, lleno de colores vibrantes, paisajes asombrosos y una impresionante diversidad de vida que coexiste en un equilibrio delicado.\\" This Spanish sentence translates to: \\"The beauty of nature is a stunning spectacle, filled with vibrant colors, amazing landscapes, and an impressive diversity of life that coexists in a delicate balance.\\""},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The tablet shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, says researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin, who deciphered the tablet and published his findings in Science. What's intriguing is that these early astronomers wrote their calculations sometime between 350BC and 50BC—at least 1,400 years earlier than the European mathematicians who currently get credit for inventing the technique, reports NPR. The upshot is that the Babylonians were dabbling in abstract principles dealing with Jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky, and they described that movement using a \\"sort of precalculus,\\" in the words of the New York Times. \\"It is an application in astronomy that was totally new,\\" says Ossendrijver. He calls it \\"truly an astonishing find,\\" and while he may be biased, others in the field seem equally wowed. \\"I think it's quite a remarkable discovery,\\" says a professor at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. The Times has a layman's explainer: \\"The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance.\\" Babylonians were known to be talented astronomers and mathematicians, but the small tablet takes them far above previous estimations, observes National Geographic. \\"This geometrical trick rewrites the history books.\\" (Scientists are getting closer to unraveling an ancient Incan technique as well.) Expand this summary.","output":"A newly deciphered clay tablet from ancient Babylon shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, according to researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin. The tablet, which dates back to sometime between 350BC and 50BC, reveals that the Babylonians were at least 1,400 years ahead of the European mathematicians who are currently credited with inventing the technique. This discovery suggests that the Babylonians were working with abstract principles related to Jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. Two villages were situated on different sides of the hill. Each village has its own approach to agriculture. East village decided to clear the land, by felling many trees and bushes, and set up a vast irrigation system. West village too a more natural approach to food production and applied the edible forest method, and all the permaculture principles over the years. Which village had more problems with groundwater salinization? A:","output":"The East village, which decided to clear the land by felling many trees and bushes and set up a vast irrigation system, would have more problems with groundwater salinization. This is because vegetation clearance and extensive irrigation practices can lead to increased salinity levels in groundwater. Vegetation clearance removes the natural root systems and evapotranspiration processes that help maintain the groundwater balance. As a result, the water table rises, increasing the chances of salts being mobilized and eventually reaching the soil surface. This process is further exacerbated by extensive irrigation, which raises the water table and further contributes to salt mobilization. On the other hand, the West village took a more natural approach to food production by applying the edible forest method and permaculture principles. These methods encourage the preservation and maintenance of natural vegetation and promote efficient water use. As a result, the risk of groundwater salinization is reduced in the West village, as the vegetation helps to maintain the water table balance and prevent the mobilization of salts."},{"instruction":"Michael Kinsley I'm clean.

Solomon, in his old age, was influenced by evil women who, of course, were not believers in God. The concept of spiritual warfare is prevalent in Christianity, with believers often told to take power and dominion over these spirits to protect their souls from corruption. Evil spirits, according to Christian theology, can latch onto a person's weaknesses or temptations and manipulate them for their own gain. This manipulation can lead to a gradual distancing from God and a weakening of one's faith. In the case of King Solomon, it is believed that he was influenced by evil spirits through his relationships with various women who did not share his belief in God. As a wise and influential figure, his connection to God was of great importance; however, his association with these women led him to stray from the righteous path. Throughout the Bible and other religious texts, there are numerous instances of people being influenced by evil spirits or corrupted by external forces. The story of Solomon serves as a cautionary tale to believers, warning them to guard their hearts and minds against ungodly influences. Taking power and dominion over these spirits in the name of Jesus requires a steadfast belief and connection to God. Through prayer, worship, and righteous living, believers can resist evil influences and keep their souls pure and devoted to God. In addition, the support of a strong faith community can provide further protection against spiritual corruption. In summary, evil spirits can lead believers astray by exploiting their weaknesses and manipulating them for their own purposes. To overcome these spirits, it is essential to maintain a relationship with God through Jesus Christ and consistently practice one's faith. The story of Solomon serves as a reminder that even the wisest among us can be corrupted by evil influences if we do not guard our hearts and minds vigilantly."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

The third Saturday in December Mark said he had made his list and had twenty dollars in his pocket. I drove him to a nearby supermarket. Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I waited and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents. Finally he came to the checkout counter and reached into his pocket ... Mark stood there holding his basket, tears falling down his face. Then a surprising thing happened. A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. \\"You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,\\" said the woman. \\"It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me.

The development of a head region, called cephalization , evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals. This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have radial symmetry. Q: The development of a head region is called what? A: A:","output":"The development of a head region in animals is called cephalization. This evolutionary process involves the concentration of nerve cells, sensory organs, and other important structures in the anterior (front) part of an organism, forming a distinct head region. Cephalization is closely associated with the emergence of bilateral symmetry, as it allows for more efficient movement and coordinated responses to environmental stimuli. In comparison, cnidarians, which evolved earlier than flatworms, do not exhibit cephalization; instead, they have radial symmetry, with body parts arranged symmetrically around a central axis. The presence of a head region, or cephalization, in flatworms and other bilaterally symmetric animals demonstrates an important step in the evolution of complex body plans and neurological systems. This concentration of neural and sensory components in the head region allows these animals to better process and respond to their surroundings, ultimately enhancing their survival and adaptability in various environments."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Which assassins still remain in the end?

As the smiling couple entered the shrine, the crowd shouted their congratulations with the Japanese word \\"Banzai\\" -- meaning an auspicious wish for long life. Close family members and friends welcomed the bride and groom as they made their way to the ceremony hall. Princess Ayako was dressed in a light yellow-colored uchiki kimono embroidered with pink flowers and green leaves and a deep purple hakama -- wide-legged pleated trousers that fall to the ankles. She also carried a fan made of Japanese cypress, called a hiougi. Moriya wore a western-style black morning coat, gray pin-striped trousers and a silk hat that belonged to Ayako's late father, Prince Takamodo. Ayako's kimono is similar in style and design to that worn by her sister Princess Noriko when she married Kunimaro Senge in 2014. The 28-year-old Princess Ayako is the youngest child of Princess Hisako and the late Prince Takamodo, cousin of Emperor Akihito. According to Japan's imperial law, female members of the royal family forfeit their titles, status and allowance if they choose to marry someone who does not have royal or aristocratic family ties. The same rule does not apply to male members of the royal family. On marrying 32-year-old Moriya -- an employee of shipping company Nippon Yusen KK -- the princess will renounce her royal status and take a lump sum of 950,000 from the Japanese government for living expenses. Japanese Princess Ayako, dressed in traditional ceremonial gown, and Japanese businessman Kei Moriya, arrive at Meiji Shrine for their wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. Before the ceremony began, Ayako changed her kimono into a more formal Shinto-style robe. She wore a red kouchiki, a \\"small cloak\\" with long, wide sleeves, and a long divided brown skirt called a naga-bakama. The ceremony itself was a private affair, attended only by close family members. Inside, the couple would have performed several rituals that mark a Shinto-style wedding, including exchanging nuptial sake cups and presenting a sacred Tamagushi branch as an offering. The newlyweds would have also exchanged marriage vows and rings. After final prayers, the couple emerged from the shrine as husband and wife. Moriya said he thought his new wife looked \\"beautiful,\\" as they took questions from reporters. \\"I would like to support her firmly and, hand in hand, build a happy family with lots of laughter,\\" he said. \\"I am awed by how blessed I am,\\" Ayako said. From a young age, Ayako said she was taught that being born into the imperial family meant her duty was to support the emperor and empress. \\"I will leave the imperial family today, but I will remain unchanged in my support for his majesty and her majesty,\\" she said. Princess Ayako on her way to her wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. The shrine where the ceremony took place is of huge symbolic importance. Opened in 1920, the Meiji Shrine is dedicated to the deified souls of Ayako's great-great grandfather Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shoken. \\"I am very happy that we held the wedding at this Meiji Shrine where my great grandfather Meiji Emperor is worshiped,\\" Ayako said. \\"I feel so happy.\\" Ayoko's marriage and resignation from royal duties comes at a trying time for the world's oldest monarchy. The country's much-loved Emperor Akihitio announced that he will abdicate on April 30, 2019, passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his son Crown Prince Naruhito. Imperial law states that the throne must be passed to male heirs, and as Naruhito has only one son, the 12-year-old Prince Hisahito could be left with the sole responsibility of carrying on the royal line. Akihitio's abdication and the forthcoming marriage of his granddaughter Princess Mako reignited debate about the role women play in Japan's monarchy and whether imperial law should change to allow women to inherit the throne. Newlyweds Princess Ayako and Kei Moriya speak to the reporters after their marriage ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018. \\"It is a sensible option and necessary in terms of managing risk but the elite conservatives that govern have resisted strongly despite robust public support for female succession,\\" said Jeff Kingston, Director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan and author of upcoming book Japan. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth approved changes to the royal line of succession and gave equal rights to sons and daughters of British monarchs to inherit the throne, officials in Japan have ruled out a similar move. An abdication law that allows Akihitio to resign was passed without a proposed resolution that potentially questions whether women who marry outside the family have to rescind their royal rights. \\"Apparently they take no inspiration from Queen Elizabeth ... and instead take refuge behind fatuous patriarchal justifications for not doing so,\\" Kingston said. \\"The law will change only if it absolutely must.\\" ||||| Japanese Princess Ayako, right, dressed in traditional ceremonial robe, and groom Kei Moriya, left, speak to the reporters after their wedding ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Monday, Oct. 29, 2018....

(Associated Press) TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Princess Ayako married a commoner in a ritual-filled ceremony Monday at Tokyo's Meiji Shrine. Ayako and groom Kei Moriya were shown on national news walking slowly before guests at the shrine. The wedding took place in one of the pagoda-like buildings in the shrine complex and included an exchange of rings and a sharing of a cup of sake, according to Japanese media. Both rituals are relatively routine for Shinto-style weddings, including those of regular Japanese. Ayako, 28, is the daughter of the emperor's cousin, and Moriya, 32, works for major shipping company Nippon Yusen. She wore a Heian-era style hairdo, which is swept back into a ponytail, and a traditional robe splashed with red and green patterns, while Moriya wore coattails. She later changed into a red Japanese robe. \\"I am filled with happiness,\\" she told reporters after the ceremony. Women who marry into the imperial family become members of the family, but those who marry commoners, like Ayako, must leave. Moriya said he hoped to help Ayako adjust to a commoner's life. \\"I want us to work together, hand in hand, to create a family filled with smiles,\\" he said. Ayako bid farewell to Emperor Akihito last week. She said Monday she hoped to continue to help the emperor and empress as a former member of the imperial family. The eldest granddaughter of the emperor is set to marry a commoner in 2020. Akihito has said he will abdicate next year. His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. Ayako and Moriya said when they announced their wedding plans that they met because their mothers were friends and hit it off immediately. \\"It didn't feel as though we had met for the first time,\\" Ayako told reporters at their engagement. Moriya said he had been attracted to her gentle spirit. \\"And I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her,\\" he said.

Claims Fraud: This can take many shapes, but it typically involves submitting a false or exaggerated claim, staging an accident or injury, or deliberately causing damage to a covered item in order to receive a payout from the insurance company. 3. Agent/Broker Fraud: Unscrupulous agents or brokers can deceive policyholders by collecting premiums for coverage that doesn't exist or forging documents to make it seem as though a policy is in place when it isn't. 4. Insider Fraud: This form of fraud involves employees or executives within an insurance company abusing their position of power or access to confidential information to facilitate fraudulent activities. How to Report Insurance Fraud: 1. Document: Whenever you suspect insurance fraud, it's essential to compile as much information as possible to support your suspicions. This may include policy numbers, names of the parties involved, dates, locations, and any other specific details relating to the incident. 2. Contact Your Insurance Company: If you believe you have discovered fraud involving your own insurance policy or coverage, it is essential to contact your insurance provider immediately. They will often have a designated fraud reporting hotline or email address that you can use to submit your concerns. 3. Report to Your State's Insurance Department: Depending on the nature of the suspected fraud, it may be appropriate to report your concerns to your state's department of insurance or regulatory agency. You can typically find contact information listed on their website or through a quick online search. 4. Contact the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB): The NICB is a non-profit organization dedicated to combating insurance fraud and crime. Their website (www.nicb.org) offers a wealth of resources and information about insurance fraud, as well as an online form for reporting suspected fraud directly to their organization. 5. Reach Out to Local Law Enforcement: In some cases, insurance fraud may involve criminal activity, and local law enforcement may need to be involved. If you suspect criminal activity may be connected to the insurance fraud incident, contact your local police department and provide them with the information you have collected. By being proactive and reporting instances of suspected insurance fraud, you can help protect not only yourself but also your community and ensure the integrity of the insurance system as a whole. By working together to combat insurance fraud, individuals and businesses alike can help maintain a fair and honest insurance marketplace that benefits everyone."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: As the world watched the twin towers of theprefix = st1 /WorldTradeCentercome under attack, a common phrase was repeated:\\" It looks like a movie.\\" But this time there was no superman to save the people or the famous building. The attack destroyed one of the world's highest skyscrapers and left 5,000 people dead or missing. Movie fans have become used to such events after years of Hollywood films showing disasters, terrorism and danger, The Empire State Building, the White House, New York City and even the American president himself have all been threatened by terrorist attacks in these exciting films. The film\\"True Lies\\", released in 1994 is considered to be a good example of this kind of movie. The special effects, including explosions and missiles, make the action look like a real thing. \\"Independence Day\\"in 1996 took this type of movie one step further by blowing up the White House. This science fiction movie is about a war between human beings and aliens from another planet. In the movie, the WorldTradeCentertowers are destroyed. Violence has become a major part of Hollywood movies. And this is what people enjoy. Soon after the attacks, many famous film companies stopped the planned releases of some of their new movies, especially if their films showed terrorist attacks or plane crashes. \\"Swordfish\\" was top of the American box office in June, 2001. But the movie's story was frighteningly similar to the Sept.11 disaster. The film would have been stopped in American and British cinemas after the attack. But it's unlikely thatHollywoodwill stay quiet for long. It is already waiting for the feeling inAmericato calm down. Question: What is the main subject of the newspaper article?

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Question: \\"Who crushed their rivals in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara?\\" Answer: \\"The Emperor\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Choices: * no; * yes;","output":"Answer: no The answer is not correct because it was Ieyasu Tokugawa who crushed his rivals in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara, not the Emperor. The Emperor at that time did not have direct control over the military. Instead, it's Ieyasu Tokugawa, one of the powerful regents and a great strategist, who defeated his enemies to establish the Tokugawa shogunate."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Did Fielding and Sarah have political differences? Movie title: Waking the Dead Movie plot: The first scene of the movie introduces Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) as he is watching news footage showing that Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has been killed in a suspected car bombing. The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality. Fielding seems ambivalent about the offer to be put on the... Answer:","output":"Yes, Fielding and Sarah had significant political differences throughout the movie plot of \\"Waking the Dead.\\" Fielding Pierce, portrayed by Billy Crudup, is an ambitious and aspiring politician with plans to one day become the president. His political ideals are more in line with the mainstream and upholding the status quo. He is seen pursuing a political career, initially being groomed to be a congressman by the current governor due to a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael (played by Ed Harris). On the other hand, Sarah Williams, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly, is a passionate activist from Chicago who dedicates her life to helping refugees from the Chilean government. Her political beliefs lean more towards challenging the system, and she is vocal about her support for the underprivileged and those fighting against oppressive regimes. An example of the couple's differences in political views is highlighted when Sarah expresses her support for the people opposing the Vietnam War, stating that if Fielding went to Vietnam, he would be shooting at the people she wants to win. Despite their stark differences in political beliefs, Fielding and Sarah find themselves attracted to and intrigued by each other. Their intense love and strong emotional connection overshadow their contrasting political views, and they quickly become involved in a deep, complicated relationship. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is important to weigh the potential market interest in a movie that delves into the complexities of a relationship amid the backdrop of contrasting political beliefs and ideals. While the storyline presents a unique combination of romance, politics, and personal growth, its success will depend upon the execution, talent involved, and the target audience's appreciation for such themes. Understanding the current market trends, the relevance of the subject matter, and how it might resonate with audiences will be crucial in making an informed decision about whether or not to invest in this film."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Bogjurgan Hill is an elevated landform at the southern verge of the Fetteresso Forest in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

Step 2: Calculate his age at the time of the draft - The 2013 NFL Draft took place from April 25 to April 27, 2013. - To find Damontre Moore's age during the draft, we need to calculate the difference between his birth date and the draft date.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","output":"Seymour.

He dreamed of exploring the vast stretches of tundra, hiking through Denali National Park, and witnessing the stunning phenomenon of the Northern Lights. Kevin, on the other hand, desired a more laid-back and tropical vacation. Kevin had been drawn to the idea of visiting Hawaii since he first saw pictures of its pristine white-sand beaches, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and lush, green vegetation. He imagined spending his days lounging under the shade of palm trees, surfing the famous waves of Waikiki, and indulging in the sweet taste of fresh pineapple. The two friends struggled to reach a mutual agreement, as their travel preferences seemed to be complete opposites. One day, while browsing through a travel magazine, Ryan stumbled upon an article that detailed a cruise starting from Vancouver and ending in Honolulu, covering both Alaska and Hawaii in the span of two and a half weeks. Immediately, Ryan shared the idea with Kevin, who found this arrangement appealing too. A cruise would allow them both to experience their dream destinations and enjoy the comforts of an all-inclusive vacation. Without further ado, they booked their spots on the cruise, excited about the adventures that awaited them. During the first week of the cruise, they marveled at the majestic sight of Alaskan glaciers calving, learned about its indigenous cultures and wildlife, and fished for salmon in glacial streams. The unique experiences provided by Alaska exceeded both their expectations. The second half of the journey turned out to be equally enthralling. As the ship sailed towards Hawaii, the temperature gradually rose, transforming the surroundings from snow-capped mountains to sun-kissed beaches. Kevin and Ryan soaked in the sun and explored Hawaii's tropical paradise, visiting the impressive volcanoes of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, attending a traditional luau, and even learning to hula dance. Despite their contrasting travel desires, the Alaskan-Hawaiian cruise turned out to be the perfect getaway for both Ryan and Kevin.

(CNN) -- It's not just a phase. They're not frigid, sick, repressed or broken. Meeting the so-called \\"right one\\" isn't going to change anything. But for people like Sandra Mellott, the questions just keep on rolling in from friends, family and loved ones who may mean well but don't understand what it's like to identify as asexual. In a society historically centered around romantic pairings and increasingly bombarded by raunchy imagery, people who don't experience sexual attraction can often feel isolated, invisible and misunderstood. But now a growing number of asexual people are banding together in solidarity and support, finding like-hearted souls in a culture where \\"happily (and hornily) ever after\\" is the end goal. Most people likely haven't heard the word \\"asexual\\" since their high school biology class, where it was used to describe plants that reproduce without a second parent. When it comes to people, however, the term can encompass a vast array of experiences. At its root, asexuality is an orientation defined by the lack of sexual attraction to other people. But humans are complicated creatures, and it only branches out from there. This is not about self-imposed celibacy. Asexual people can identify as gay, straight, bisexual or none of the above. Intersex dating: Finding love across the intersection Aro Ace = Aromantic Asexual Some, like Mellott, are aromantic to varying degrees and have little to no emotionally romantic attraction to other people. They may still experience and desire intense friendship bonds, crushes, or \\"squishes\\" -- which Asexuality.org defines as the platonic equivalent of a romantic crush. Some have romantic feelings, but are satisfied with cuddling, hand-holding and proximity. Still others experience waxing and waning degrees and frequency of sexual attraction, drive and pleasure, thus finding themselves on what's called the \\"gray-A\\" spectrum, depending upon the circumstances and parties involved. An ongoing meme in online asexual circles is that even if someone isn't interested in sex, there's always cake, and who doesn't like that? Images of cake are often used to welcome new members or reward them for various life victories online and off. The community is not without a strong sense of humor and warmth -- but it's not always met with a tremendous degree of understanding from people wired since birth to believe that pair bonding is the end-all, be-all. Mellott, a writer and victim advocate at a Montana shelter, has always known that she was asexual and aromantic, but has often struggled to get the people around her to accept it as fact. At age 5 she got her first boyfriend, and promptly forgot, neglecting to write the love poem they had agreed to exchange the next day. At 10, she braced herself for questions from adults wondering if she had a boyfriend yet, rehearsing the answer, \\"I don't want one; I'm just not interested.\\" At 13, a quick Internet search for \\"asexual\\" confirmed to her that she wasn't alone. At 18, she casually came out to a female classmate who thought it was \\"the coolest thing ever,\\" and at 21, to a male classmate who tried to \\"help\\" her by suggesting masturbation. At 25, she came out to her family, confirming what she thought they probably knew, and letting them know she was at peace with it. \\"This is a permanent part of who I am, and I'm proud and confident about it.\\" Mellott says her mother was loving and supportive -- and entirely baffled. \\"She understands what I'm saying but just can't comprehend how it's possible herself,\\" Mellott says. \\"So she asks these 'really, not ever?' kind of questions that aren't malicious but get tiring, mostly because they're coming from someone who I love and want to just accept and understand me without all this extra effort.\\" What not to say to a transgender person And then there are the men who treat her as a potential sexual conquest. \\"Sometimes I think they take my orientation as some kind of personal attack and they can get really hostile about it,\\" she says. Megan Allen, who works as a health care professional in a town outside of Seattle, has known all her 21 years that sexual attraction just wasn't in the cards for her. She identifies as a repulsed asexual -- a person for whom the idea of sexual contact is simply disgusting. \\"All of those bodily fluids and being in such a vulnerable position, and the diseases it could cause, and just... eww,\\" she says. It's not a prudishness on her part; she's done her due diligence on the matter, even to the point of being involved in a nudist colony. There was an \\"actual psych test to join that proves you're not there to be a pervert,\\" she says. \\"So I've seen it all.\\" But she, too, knew from an early age that some activities simply aren't an option for her, and that it might limit her prospects for partnership. \\"Because of my complete unwillingness to compromise on sex, I'm sort of limited on my dating options,\\" she realizes. Other asexuals, the impotent, people willing to confine their sexual encounters to either self-gratification or a mistress Allen approves would be the only viable solutions, she says. \\"Obviously, the last two would put quite a strain on any relationship.\\" But she's more open about herself these days than she was in the past -- even placing a bet with several family members who don't believe that her orientation is set in stone. \\"I tried to discuss this with my sister once, and with my parents,\\" Allen says. \\"Both proceeded to make bets with me that I would change my mind someday. I put it in writing both times, they're in my dad's safe. In about nine years, it'll be fun to collect the hundred dollars.\\" And she hopes that by that point, the public's attitudes toward asexual people will have changed. \\"I wish the public knew that we exist and we aren't 'sick' or 'wrong'\\" she says. \\"I also wish the LGBTQ community would just get over themselves and accept us ... we're awfully isolated and little-known.\\" They're also not putting up with being pathologized. The Asexual Visibility and Education Network hosts a large online asexual community and resource site, and acts as a force for social acceptance and change. When criteria for the most recent updates to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was being considered, an AVEN DSM Task Force presented the American Psychiatric Association's committee with a 75-page document containing academic research concluding that asexuals should not be included under the diagnosis of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Instead, they argued, asexuality should be considered an identity rather than a dysfunction. It worked. In the DSM-5, an absent or diminished sex drive is considered a disorder or dysfunction only if it's caused significant distress to the person -- not if they have self-identified as asexual. This may not seem like much to the general public, but it means the world to people who may have spent their lives feeling marginalized and ashamed for not experiencing the feelings that are central to so many societal customs. Photos: Asexuals tell their stories Gray is an asexuality education advocate who also works as a circus performer. Gray, a 29-year-old Oregon man who identifies as \\"grey-A or greysexual,\\" always knew that he didn't quite fit into the dating roles he saw acted out around him. While he considered himself heterosexual and had romantic, sexual relationship with women, after one particular breakup, he just felt \\"different.\\" \\"My ex proudly claimed she 'broke' me,\\" Gray says. \\"And some of my so-called-friends silently agreed.\\" Unwilling to settle for that diagnosis (and confident he wasn't gay, as some around him suggested) he looked for answers. He found them in the form of a YouTube video on asexuality that appeared by chance in his feed. He contacted the uploader who answered all his questions, and counseled him that \\"sexuality is something that's fluid, and can change over time.\\" This validation and acceptance comes in handy in challenging times, such as when people are trying to convince him that he's in denial or confused. \\"One woman I came out to tried to convince me that I'm not actually asexual, but I'm actually a magical psychic who isn't attracted to anyone because I was subconsciously searching for the woman I'm meant to be with,\\" says Gray. \\"This is essentially what many others have tried to tell me: 'You're not asexual, you just haven't met the right person yet.' Only this woman was also making me out to be Harry Potter.\\" Ellie Carlin, a 20-year-old Ohio resident who identifies as a hetero-romantic asexual, sees the Internet as a catalyst for this change. She considers herself lucky for stumbling across AVEN at age 17 and finding that she wasn't alone, but she realizes that older asexuals didn't have the benefit of this information and communication when they were coming of age. \\"Before the advancement of technology I believe many who now identify as asexual knew they were somehow different from their peers but never truly understood themselves,\\" Carlin says. \\"However since the founding of AVEN and its website, many asexuals have gathered to better understand themselves. It was finally a place where you realized you weren't alone, nor were you a freak.\\" \\"There are older asexuals as well in the community. I've found that they themselves had not realized they were asexuals until the existence of the Internet. Many of them had sexual experiences, and even had children. They seemed to think there was either something wrong with them medically, or they just figured sex wasn't as good as it was hyped to be,\\" Carlin says. Older asexuals say they have begun to find self-acceptance and share their experiences with younger people who are just beginning to understand their sexual identity. For 32-year-old Arkansas resident Heather Runyan, seeing her experiences mirrored in other people's -- even those she will never meet -- has gone a long way toward making her feel normal. At age 30, she typed \\"asexual\\" into a search engine on whim and found AVEN. It was a turning point for her. \\"For a long time I thought I was a late bloomer,\\" Runyan says. \\"I thought that I should feel attraction, but I didn't, so I felt like I was broken. When people asked, I just told them I was happy single and didn't feel the need to date. In my head, I often referred to myself as asexual, but I didn't realize that it was a valid orientation.\\" She now identifies as aromantic asexual. Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. Runyan counts herself lucky to have the support of her family, especially her mother. And once she told her friends about her orientation, they left the topic alone. \\"No one has ever tried to set me up on a date or even insinuated that there is something wrong with my desire to be single,\\" says Runyan. \\"I feel very fortunate because I know that many people face pressure to date and get married.\\" Still, she believes the public could stand to be more educated about the asexuals who live among them. \\"We exist. That may sound simple, but too often when someone says they are asexual, the first response from others is to deny or question it,\\" Runyan says. \\"It also sends the message that there is something wrong with us. I do not need to be fixed or cured, I am asexual and that's OK.\\" Mellott agrees. So far as she is concerned, it doesn't matter whether other people totally understand, as long as they show some respect. As she put it in a 2013 Tumblr post: \\"The point is, don't make assumptions, and don't challenge people when they don't behave how you expect. Actually, there's a nice asexual T-shirt that sums this up: 'When you say I'm confused about my sexuality, what you mean is you're confused about my sexuality.' And really, that goes for all sexualities. Thoughts to ponder.\\" For asexuals all over the spectrum, that kind of respect would really take the cake. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Asexuality is when a person does not feel any sexual attraction to others. There are many different experiences and feelings that can come with being asexual, and some people may still have romantic feelings or want close friendships. In a world where people often expect romantic relationships, asexual people can feel alone and misunderstood. However, many asexual people are now connecting with each other and supporting one another, both online and in person. Asexuality is not a disorder or a problem, but just another way for people to experience life. It is important to be respectful and understanding of other people's experiences and feelings, no matter how different they might be from our own."},{"instruction":"Price based on booking for 7 nights and 5 people including a 10 discount What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"\\"Price based on booking for 7 nights and 5 people, including a 10% discount.\\" Here are the justifications for the punctuation adjustments: 1.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why was the programmer so lost with what the narrator was saying ?","output":"In the above passage, the programmer demonstrates confusion and lack of knowledge about protein shakes when the narrator inquires about them. When asked about protein shakes, the narrator expects the programmer to provide detailed, scientific information about the specific ratios and components that make the shakes effective. However, the programmer simply says \\"Nothing,\\" which suggests that he has no knowledge or understanding of the subject matter. There are a few possible reasons for the programmer's unfamiliarity with the topic. One reason could be that the programmer's expertise lies within computer programming and technology, and not in nutrition or health-related areas. The passage seems to imply that the narrator expects specific knowledge about protein shakes from their programmer friend, which may be misguided. Another possibility is that the programmer might not be interested in or have experience with fitness and nutrition, and therefore not knowledgeable about protein shakes' benefits or purposes. The mention of expecting a \\"magical compound\\" recommendation hints that the narrator might be looking for a quick solution to their nutritional needs, and it's possible that the programmer doesn't follow that mindset or hasn't delved into that specific aspect of health and fitness. In conclusion, the programmer's unfamiliarity with protein shakes could stem from a lack of expertise in nutrition, not having interest or experience in fitness, or simply not having the needed information about the specific topic.
