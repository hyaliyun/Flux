Detailed Instructions: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. Q: We have dreams almost every night. Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green? New research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams. While almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . \\"It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed\\", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study. Research from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color. Since this period also marked the transition between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions. But now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25. She asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV. She then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent. But the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time. Even though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist. \\"The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream\\", she said. A:","output":"Step 1: Read the passage thoroughly I begin by reading the context passage carefully to understand the main idea and any relevant information that can be used to come up with a question. Step 2: Identify key information The passage discusses the impact of television on the color of dreams, particularly the type of television (black and white or colored) that individuals were exposed to during their childhood. It mentions that this factor may affect whether people dream in black and white or color.

Step 4: Create a clear and concise question Question: According to Eva Murzyn's study, what percentage of dreams of the over-55s who only had access to black-and-white media were in black and white?

Here is a hypothesis: The smell of cedar brought back fond memories. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To establish whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, it is essential to break down both statements and identify their key components. This will help to determine if the hypothesis is a valid conclusion derived from the premise. Premise: The smell of burning cedar brought back memories of a childhood long lost. Key Components: 1. Smell of burning cedar 2. Memories of a childhood long lost Hypothesis: The smell of cedar brought back fond memories. Key Components: 1. Smell of cedar 2. Fond memories Based on the key components of both the premise and the hypothesis, let's compare and contrast their elements. 1. Smell of burning cedar vs. Smell of cedar: The premise refers to the smell of \\"burning cedar,\\" whereas the hypothesis refers to the smell of \\"cedar\\" without mentioning the burning aspect. While it is highly plausible that the smells could be similar, they are not necessarily identical. Burning cedar has a distinct aroma compared to cedar in its unburnt form. 2. Memories of a childhood long lost vs. Fond memories: The premise states that the smell of burning cedar evokes memories of a \\"childhood long lost,\\" while the hypothesis refers to \\"fond memories.\\" It is important to note that \\"childhood long lost\\" does not inherently imply \\"fond\\" memories. A long-lost childhood could be comprised of various experiences, positive or negative. Therefore, it is a leap to automatically associate it with fond memories. Given the differences between the key components of the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. However, it is essential to mention that the given hypothesis could still hold some truth. When exposed to the smell of cedar, the individual might indeed recall fond memories. Nevertheless, this connection is not sufficiently established by the premise alone, as the premise does not explicitly state that the memories brought back are fond or that the specific smell of cedar (not burning cedar) is responsible for the recollection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: We all know what it is like to be unable to turn your head because of a cold in the muscles   of your neck, or because an unexpected twist has made your neck ache. The slightest move makes you jump with pain. Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck. That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling. We have all met such people. One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of yourself-control after they have settled into their seats...Well, what now...God, one of them is up again. He forgot to go to the men's room, and once more you have to stand up, hanging on to your hat and coat to let him pass. Now, that is \\" _ \\". Another, well--known to us all, is the person sitting behind you in the movies. His mouth is full of popcorn  ; he is chewing loudly, or talking between bites to friends next to him. None of them remain still. Up and down, back and forth, they go--for another bag of popcorn, or something to drink. Then, there is the man sitting next to you at lunch, smoking. He wants you to enjoy it too, and blows smoke across your food into your mouth. We must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway and sits down next to you, just as close as you will let him. You are reading the newspaper and he gets closer so that he can read the paper with you. He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it.

Premise: Take the long  U.S. policy wobbles because it is always responding to the crisis du jour--the Cox report, WTO, the latest suppression of dissidents, etc. Hypothesis: US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.  To understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let us first analyze them individually.  Premise:  The premise states that the U.S. policy wobbles because it is always responding to the crisis du jour (the crisis of the day). This includes specific examples of crises, such as the Cox report, WTO, and the latest suppression of dissidents. The term \\"wobbles\\" suggests that the U.S. policy is not consistent and is always shifting in response to these crises.  Hypothesis:  The hypothesis posits that US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis, aligning with the premise's sentiment regarding the U.S. policy's lack of consistency. Connection between premise and hypothesis:  Both the premise and hypothesis convey a similar idea – U.S. policy is reactive and consistently shifting in response to the most recent crisis. Consequently, the hypothesis can be considered as entailed by the premise. The premise discusses the U.S. policy's wavering nature due to the ongoing response to different crises, which has weakened its consistency and stability. Similarly, the hypothesis puts forth that U.S. policy's constant reaction to the latest crisis reinforces the premise. Furthermore, the examples provided in the premise, such as the Cox report, WTO, and the latest suppression of dissidents, illustrate specific instances of crises that the U.S. policy had to deal with. These examples further support the hypothesis that U.S. policy is continuously responding to the latest crisis. In conclusion, the hypothesis stating that US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis aligns with and is entailed by the premise that U.S. policy wobbles due to its reactive nature and continuous response to the crisis du jour."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Jane Eyre Movie plot: The movie begins in Gateshead Hall, where a ten-year-old orphan named Jane Eyre is living with her mother's brother's family. The brother, surnamed Reed, dies shortly after adopting Jane. His wife, Mrs. Sarah Reed, and their three children (John, Eliza and Georgiana) neglect and abuse Jane, for they resent Mr. Reed's preference for the little orphan in their midst. In addition, they dislike Jane's plain looks and quiet yet passionate character. Thus, the novel begins with young John Reed bullying Jane, who retaliates with unwonted violence. Jane is blamed for the ensuing fight, and Mrs. Reed has two of the servants drag her off and lock her up in the red-room, the unused chamber where Mr. Reed had died. Still locked in that night, Jane sees a light and panics, thinking that her uncle's ghost has come. Her scream rouses the house, but Mrs. Reed just locks up Jane for longer. Then Jane has a fit and passes out. A doctor, Mr. Lloyd, comes to Gateshead Hall and suggests that Jane go to school.Mr. Brocklehurst is a cold, cruel, self-righteous, and highly hypocritical clergyman who runs a charity school called Lowood. He accepts Jane as a pupil in his school. Jane is infuriated, however, when Mrs. Reed tells him, falsely, that Jane is a liar. After Brocklehurst departs, Jane bluntly tells Mrs. Reed how she hates the Reed family. Mrs. Reed, so shocked that she is scarcely capable of responding, leaves the drawing room in haste.Jane finds life at Lowood to be grim. Miss Maria Temple, the youthful superintendent, is just and kind, but another teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is sour and abusive. Mr. Brocklehurst, visiting the school for an inspection, has Jane placed on a tall stool before the entire assemblage. He then tells them that \\"...this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernautthis girl isa liar!\\"Later that day, Miss Temple allows Jane to speak in her own defence.

Earlier a CDU activist urged Mrs Merkel to resign, condemning her \\"laissez-faire\\" refugee policy as \\"a burden that we will not get rid of any time soon\\". There was applause when the Afghan boy, called Edris, said in German: \\"I would like to thank you, Mrs Merkel\\". He was tearful when she shook his hand. The emotional moment was reminiscent of Mrs Merkel's controversial encounter with a tearful Palestinian girl, whom she comforted on German TV in July 2015. The girl, Reem, feared deportation to a camp in Lebanon. Last year, 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany - an unprecedented influx. And in January-October this year the German authorities received 693,758 asylum requests. The largest groups in January-October were: Syrians (38%), Afghans (18%) and Iraqis (13.5%), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) reported. Many can settle in Germany as refugees fleeing war and persecution. But the influx has put pressure on housing and the welfare system. The crisis also triggered criticism of Mrs Merkel, including within CDU ranks. The nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now a serious rival to the CDU in some regions. Mrs Merkel plans to run for a fourth term as chancellor in elections next year. She insists that Germany has a humanitarian and historic duty to help refugees. There were boos when a veteran CDU member, Ulrich Sauer, told a regional CDU conference in the western city of Heidelberg: \\"Madame Chancellor, step down. \\"With your truly unparalleled 'laissez-faire' refugee policy you have burdened us with something that we will not get rid of any time soon.\\" The mood changed when Konrad Reuter, a retired teacher who helps refugees, introduced Edris and the boy's proud father. Edris was lifted up to say \\"thank you, Mrs Merkel\\" on a big video screen, drawing applause. \\"I am very, very happy,\\" the boy said. On the podium Mrs Merkel, smiling broadly, told him: \\"Okay, you learned a lot of German already. Do you sometimes speak German?\\" Edris said: \\"I only speak [German] to my dad.\\" Mrs Merkel replied: \\"You speak German to your dad? That's pretty good already. Is your mum here too? No, oh well then keep on practising.\\" Edris was heard saying \\"I wanted to touch your hands once\\" - prompting Mrs Merkel to go over to the side of the hall, where she met Edris and his father.

Many CDU activists have demanded her resignation, considering the policy a \\"laissez-faire\\" approach, and arguing that it will negatively impact Germany in the long-term. The surge of asylum seekers arriving in Germany has also intensified the pressure on housing and welfare systems.

On 6 June, Philip had announced his renunciation of the French throne; the British Tory government now offered the Dutch a revised Barrier Treaty, replacing that of 1709 which they rejected as overly generous. It was a significant improvement on the 1697 Barrier but ultimately subject to Austrian approval and the final terms were less beneficial.Charles withdrew from the Conference when France insisted on a guarantee that Austria would not seek to acquire Mantua or Mirandola; he was supported by George, Elector of Hanover, who wanted France to withdraw their support for the Stuart heir James Francis. This meant neither Austria or the Empire signed the Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713 between France and the other Allies; Spain made peace with the Dutch in June, then Savoy and Britain on 13 July 1713. Fighting continued on the Rhine but Austria was financially exhausted and after the loss of Landau and Freiburg in November 1713, Charles came to terms. The Treaty of Rastatt on 7 March 1714 confirmed Austria's gains in Italy, returned Breisach, Kehl and Freiburg, ended French support for the Hungarian revolt and terms for the Dutch Barrier fortresses. France acquired Strasbourg and Alsace while Charles agreed to reinstate the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, Max Emmanuel and Joseph Clemens.

Q: Objective: To evaluate the scientific basis for the use of Kang 601 heji (K-601) as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent using appropriate animal models. Methods: Carrageenan-induced rat paw and xylene-induced ear oedemas were models used to investigate anti-inflammatory actions of K-601. Lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia model was used to evaluate antipyretic activity in Wistar rats. The antiinflammatory and antipyretic mechanisms were evaluated by detecting prostaglandins E 2 , nitric oxide, interleukin-1b and tumour necrosis factor-a levels using appropriate reagents and ELISA kits. Results: The results revealed that K-601 reduced the level of inflammations in both antiinflammatory models in a dose-dependent manner. The same was true for the antipyretic model. The possible mechanisms of actions were through the inhibition of prostaglandins E 2 , interleukin-1b, tumour necrosis factor-a and nitric oxide.

These were Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. The youngest sister, Anne, was also a gifted novelist, and her books have the same extraordinary quality as her sisters'. Their father was Patrick Bronte, born in Ireland. He moved with his wife, Maria Bronte, and their six small children to Haworth in Yorkshire in 1820. Soon after, Mrs. Bronte and the two eldest children died, leaving the father to care of the remaining three girls and a boy. Charlotte was born in 1816. Emily was born in 1818 and Anne in 1820. Their brother Branwell was born in 1817. Left to themselves, the children wrote and told stories and walked over the hills. They grew up largely self-educated. Branwell showed a great interest in drawing. The girls were determined to earn money for his art education. They took positions as teachers or taught children in their homes. As children they had all written many stories. Charlotte, as a young girl, alone wrote 22 books, each with 60 to 100 pages of small handwriting. Therefore, they turned to writing for income. By 1847, Charlotte had written The Professor; Emily, Wuthering Heights; and Anne, Agnes Grey. After much difficulty Anne and Emily found a publisher , but there was no interest shown in Charlotte's book. (It was not published until 1859.) However, one publisher expressed an interest in seeing more of her works. Jane Eyre was already started, and she hurriedly finished it. It was accepted at once; thus each of the sisters had a book published in 1847. Jane Eyre was immediately successful; the other two, however, did not do so well. People did not like Wuthering Heights. They said it was too wild, too animal-like. But gradually it came to be considered one of the finest novels in the English language. Emily lived only a short while after the publication of the book, and Anne died in 1849. Charlotte published Shirley in 1849, and Villette in 1853. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls. But only a year later, she died of tuberculosis  as her sisters had.   Answer: Jane Eyre was published in 1847","output":"Question: In what year was Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, published?

Read this article and answer this question at Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina The Falcons opened the regular season on the road against the Carolina Panthers on September 10.  Even though the Panthers scored first, with opposing kicker John Kasay getting a 54-yard field goal, the Falcons responded with a field goal of their own, as kicker Michael Koenen booted a 25-yarder.  In the second quarter, the Falcons unleashed their best, as Koenen got a 32-yard field goal and QB Michael Vick completed a 34-yard pass to WR Michael Jenkins.  The Panthers tried to respond in the third quarter with Kasay kicking a 46-yard field goal, but Vick and the Falcons put the game away with a 1-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler.  Other than Vick having a good game, Warrick Dunn contributed with 132 rushing yards, while Atlanta's newest member, defensive end John Abraham, had 5 tackles, 2 sacks and two forced fumbles. How many total field goal yards did John Kasay make?","output":"To calculate the total field goal yards that John Kasay made, we need to identify the distance of each field goal he made in the game. From the text: 1. John Kasay got a 54-yard field goal in the beginning. 2. Kasay kicked a 46-yard field goal in the third quarter. Now, we'll sum up the distance of his field goals:  54 yards (first field goal) + 46 yards (second field goal) = 100 yards John Kasay made a total of 100 field goal yards in the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Clean keyboard keys. Choose your answer from: A). Insert sticky side of post it notes in between keys.; B). Insert dry side of post it notes in between keys.;","output":"To determine the best solution for the goal of cleaning keyboard keys, let's analyze the options step-by-step: 1. Assess effectiveness: The primary goal of cleaning keyboard keys is to remove dust, debris, and any residue from their surfaces. The sticky side of post-it notes may be more effective at grabbing and holding onto the dust and debris between keys, while the dry side would likely only push the dirt around or temporarily trap it before it falls back onto the keyboard. 2. Assess potential harm: Neither option presents a significant risk to the keyboard or the user. However, using the sticky side might be slightly more likely to leave behind a residue, which could attract more dirt in the long run. Considering these factors, option A (inserting the sticky side of post-it notes in between keys) seems initially more effective in achieving the goal of cleaning keyboard keys. Despite the potential risk of residue, it is more likely to remove dust and debris compared to option B. However, it should be noted that this method may not be the best or most thorough way to clean a keyboard, and other methods (such as using a compressed air duster) might yield better results overall."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A university system is a set of multiple, affiliated universities and colleges that are usually geographically distributed. Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance. Additionally, for-profit universities, such as DeVry University, often have multiple campuses which share the same name; these may be, but are not always, described as a university system (not necessarily accurately, see below).  - The University of the Philippines Manila (also referred to as UPM or UP Manila) is a coeducational and public research university in the Philippines. Located in Manila, the country's capital city, it is the oldest of the seven constituent universities of the University of the Philippines system. Its oldest degree-granting unit is the College of Medicine, which was founded in 1905 as the Philippine Medical School, predating the founding of UP by three years.  - A national university is generally a university created or managed by a government, but which may at the same time operate autonomously without direct control by the state.  - The University of the Philippines Manila - College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college by population of the University of the Philippines Manila , one of the constituent universities of the University of the Philippines System .

Founded by the American colonial government on June 18, 1908, it was originally a university conceived for the Filipinos. Act 1870 of the 1st Philippine Legislature was signed to establish UP to provide \\"advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and arts, and to give professional and technical training\\" to eligible students regardless of \\"age, sex, nationality, religious belief and political affiliation\\". UP has institutional autonomy as the country's national university as mandated by Republic Act No. 9500 (UP Charter of 2008).  - Filipinos are the people who are native to, or identified with the country of the Philippines. The people of the Philippines come from various ethnolinguistic groups, with the vast majority of Filipinos being of Austronesian stock.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.

Given the background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets.

The doorway is too slim. --- Desperately needing to install the new air purifier in the living room, Sandra stared at the doorway, frustrated that it was too slim for the appliance to fit through. She knew that her family's health would significantly improve with the air purifier, but couldn't think of a way to get it inside. Step 1: Assess the situation Sandra decided to assess the situation carefully. She measured the air purifier's dimensions and the doorway's width. The air purifier was 36 inches wide, while the doorway was only 32 inches. That left her with a 4-inch difference that she needed to overcome. Step 2: Consider alternative methods Sandra thought about different ways to get the air purifier through the slim doorway. She considered disassembling the air purifier, but she wasn't sure if she could put it back together correctly. She also thought about removing the door from its hinges, but that would only give her an extra inch or so, which was not enough. Step 3: Consult the manual With no solution in sight, Sandra picked up the air purifier manual to see if there was any information on disassembling or any other guidance on getting the appliance through slim doorways. To her relief, the manual mentioned that the air purifier could be easily disassembled into two smaller parts to facilitate moving it through narrow spaces. Step 4: Disassemble the air purifier Following the instructions in the manual, Sandra carefully disassembled the air purifier into two smaller parts. She made sure to keep all the screws and connectors in a safe place to avoid losing them. Step 5: Move the air purifier parts through the doorway Now that the air purifier was in two smaller pieces, Sandra was able to effortlessly carry each part through the slim doorway and into the living room. Step 6: Reassemble the air purifier After both parts were in the living room, Sandra meticulously followed the manual's instructions to reassemble the air purifier. She made sure all the connectors were secure and the screws were tightened properly. Step 7: Test the air purifier With the air purifier reassembled, Sandra plugged it in and turned it on to make sure it was functioning correctly. She was relieved to see that the appliance was working perfectly, and the LED indicator showed that the air quality in the living room was rapidly improving. Feeling both accomplished and relieved, Sandra sat on her couch, taking a deep breath of fresh air. She knew she had made the right decision in purchasing the air purifier and felt confident that her family's health would drastically improve because of it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This house would make physical education compulsory What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"In the debate surrounding whether physical education should be made compulsory or not, there are various arguments that present a strong case for implementing it as a mandatory component within the educational system. One such argument can be founded on the basis of the numerous and significant benefits that physical education offers for the overall wellbeing and development of students. 1. Health Benefits: In a world where an increasing number of people are leading sedentary lifestyles, obesity and other health issues are becoming persistent concerns. Introducing compulsory physical education helps students engage in regular physical activity, consequently lowering the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, and other lifestyle-related issues. Moreover, fostering active and healthy habits from an early age can lead to a lifelong commitment to a healthier lifestyle. 2. Academic Achievements: Research has shown that regular physical activity can lead to better academic performance and cognitive development in students. Engaging in physical exercise can help students improve their concentration, memory, and overall focus, thus aiding them in their academic pursuits. Ensuring compulsory physical education can result in students attaining better grades and being more prepared for higher education and career options. 3. Emotional Wellbeing: Physical activity is known to have a positive impact on mental health, including reducing stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. By making physical education compulsory, students will have a designated time to engage in activities that can enhance their emotional wellbeing, thereby alleviating the strain caused by academic pressure and daily stressors. 4. Social Skills Development: Participating in team sports and group activities within physical education classes promotes a sense of belonging and allows students to develop crucial social skills. They learn the importance of teamwork, communication, and sportsmanship, which are essential for maintaining healthy relationships and leading successful lives in the future. 5. Personal Growth and Discipline: Engaging in regular physical activity encourages students to set personal goals, persevere through challenges, and develop a sense of discipline. These skills can be easily transferred to other areas of their lives, such as study habits and work ethic, fostering well-rounded individuals who possess the determination to achieve their objectives. 6. Inclusivity and Adaptation: Compulsory Physical Education programs can be tailored to incorporate students of all physical abilities and needs, ensuring that no one is left behind. This approach encourages inclusivity, fosters a supportive atmosphere, and helps students understand the importance of respecting the diverse needs and abilities of others. 7. Lifelong Enjoyment of Physical Activity and Sports: By participating in a variety of sports and activities in a supportive and positive environment, students can discover their interests and develop a lifelong appreciation for physical activity. This, in turn, can lead to a healthier and more active adult population that continues to engage in fitness-related activities throughout their lives. In conclusion, making physical education compulsory can contribute significantly to the overall health, growth, and personal development of students, along with fostering essential skills and habits that will support them throughout their lives. It is crucial for educational policymakers to recognize the importance of incorporating physical education as a mandatory component to nurture well-rounded, successful individuals who lead fulfilling, healthy lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: Fix damage to hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools.","output":"Fixing damage to hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools can be achieved by following a comprehensive hair care routine that focuses on preventing further damage, repairing existing damage, and maintaining overall hair health. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you restore your hair's vitality after exposure to chlorine. 1. Rinse your hair immediately after swimming: After you've finished swimming, it's important to thoroughly rinse your hair with clean, fresh water to remove as much chlorine as possible. This helps prevent further damage by minimizing the time your hair is in contact with the harsh chemicals found in the pool. 2. Use a clarifying shampoo: Washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo specifically designed to remove chlorine and other chemical residues can help further minimize the damage. You may want to look for a shampoo containing sodium thiosulfate, a powerful dechlorinator, to remove chlorine effectively. Use the clarifying shampoo at least once a week, or more often if you swim frequently. 3. Apply a deep conditioner: Chlorine can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and brittle. To help combat this, apply a deep conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends, after washing it with the clarifying shampoo. Look for conditioners with ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, or shea butter to help restore moisture and nourish your hair. Leave the conditioner in for a minimum of 20-30 minutes (or as instructed on the product) before rinsing it out thoroughly. 4. Use a leave-in conditioner: A leave-in conditioner can provide additional protection by forming a barrier between your hair and pool water. It helps to restore moisture and improve hair manageability. Apply a small amount of the leave-in conditioner to your towel-dried hair, focusing on the mid-lengths to ends. Do not rinse out. 5. Avoid heat styling: Heat styling tools like hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons can worsen the damage caused by chlorine exposure. To minimize further damage, let your hair air dry whenever possible, and limit the use of heat styling tools. 6. Get regular trims: Regularly trimming your hair can help prevent split ends and remove damaged sections of your hair. Try to get a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your hair in good condition. 7. Use a swim cap: To prevent chlorine damage in the future, wear a swim cap while swimming. Although a swim cap might not keep your hair completely dry, it will significantly reduce chlorine exposure. 8. Pre-treat your hair: Before getting into the pool, wet your hair with clean water and apply a small amount of conditioner. This will help create a barrier against chlorine absorption, and help minimize damage. 9. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water keeps your entire body, including your hair, hydrated. Dehydration can contribute to dry, brittle hair, compounding the effects of chlorine exposure. Aim to drink about 8-10 glasses of water per day, depending on your activity level and individual needs. 10. Maintain a healthy diet: Nourish your hair from within by eating a well-balanced diet including lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. This will supply your hair with the nutrients it needs for optimal health and growth. Consider taking biotin or a hair, skin, and nails supplement to further support hair health. By following these steps, you can help repair and prevent further damage to your hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools, restoring its health and shine. Stay consistent with your hair care routine, and in time your hair should look and feel much better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My hand was always the first to be raised when Miss Benson called for volunteers to clean the blackboards or gather papers. I would arrange and rearrange the papers. They had to be in perfect order before I went back to my seat unwillingly. Early in the term, I started asking my mother to put an extra apple or peach in my lunch, but I never quite worked up the courage to hand my gift to her directly.

Question: How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder? Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147 Answer:","output":"According to libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, affirmative action programs may disincentivize poor white people in several ways. These programs, as described by Sowell, tend to benefit mostly the fortunate among the preferred groups, such as upper and middle-class blacks. This can result in disadvantages for the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups, including poor whites or Asians. Furthermore, affirmative action reduces the incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform at their best. The preferred because they may not feel the need to work hard due to the benefits received, while the non-preferred because their effort can prove futile in the face of group preference policies. This, Sowell suggests, results in net losses for society as a whole. Lastly, these programs can engender animosity toward preferred groups."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm Kate.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. Question 1: What are the latest women rights regarding divorce? Women's rights in divorce have evolved significantly over time and can vary depending on the country or jurisdiction. In general, there has been a shift towards a more equitable distribution of assets and child custody rights, as well as a focus on women's economic independence. To understand the latest women rights in divorce, it's important to look at different aspects: 1. Asset Distribution: Marital assets are now typically distributed more equally between spouses. In some countries and states, the principle of community property applies, meaning that any assets, property, or income acquired during the marriage are divided equally upon divorce. In others, there is a principle of equitable distribution, where the division of assets is based on fairness and need rather than strict equality. 2. Alimony/Spousal Support: In many cases, women may be entitled to alimony or spousal support after a divorce. This financial support can allow women to maintain their standard of living, especially if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period, to care for children. The amount and duration of alimony payments can depend on factors such as the length of the marriage, each spouse's income and earning capacity, and whether the recipient spouse can eventually become financially self-sufficient. 3. Child Custody and Support: Women's rights regarding child custody have also become more balanced in recent years. Whereas mothers were traditionally awarded primary physical custody, many countries now uphold the concept of shared parenting, where both parents are granted equal parental rights and responsibilities. Child support payments often depend on factors such as the incomes of both parents, the number of children, and the time each parent spends with the children. 4. Legal Representation: Women have the right to legal representation in divorce proceedings. It is crucial to have a knowledgeable attorney by one's side to help navigate the complexities of divorce law and ensure that a fair and equitable settlement is reached. Question 2: What are the most touching quotes on Women's rights? Many quotes touch on the importance of women's rights and the ongoing struggle for gender equality. Here are some notable quotes: 1. 'There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish.' - Michelle Obama 2. 'The education and empowerment of women throughout the world cannot fail to result in a more caring, tolerant, just and peaceful life for all.' - Aung San Suu Kyi 3. 'Freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.' - Nelson Mandela 4. 'Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights.' - Hillary Clinton 5. 'Here's to strong women: May we know them, may we be them, may we raise them.' - Unknown 6. 'To all the little girls watching: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your dreams.' - Hillary Clinton 7. 'Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn't be that women are the exception.' - Ruth Bader Ginsburg 8. 'The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day; a movement is only people moving.' - Gloria Steinem These quotes emphasize the importance of women's rights, gender equality, and female empowerment. They serve as a reminder that progress has been made, but the struggle for women to achieve true equality and equal opportunities in all aspects of life is still ongoing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Campbell arrested 'after young paralegal for Clem's side bought him drinks' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Charles Campbell, Attorney Representing Todd Schnitt, Arrested After Paralegal Buys Him Drinks Introduction: Prominent attorney Charles Campbell, 64, who is representing radio personality Todd \\"MJ\\" Schnitt in a high-profile lawsuit against Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\" Clem, was recently arrested in an unusual incident involving a young paralegal from the opposing side. Background (step 1: provide context for the lawsuit): Campbell is representing Schnitt in a defamation suit against Clem, a controversial radio host known as Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\"\\". The lawsuit stems from disparaging comments Clem made on-air about Schnitt and his wife, which Schnitt claims have caused significant damage to both his and his wife's reputations. Incident (step 2: describe the incident leading to Campbell's arrest): According to reports, Campbell was arrested after the young paralegal, who works for Clem's legal team, allegedly purchased several drinks for him at a local bar. While the exact circumstances of the arrest have not been made public, it has raised questions about the ethical implications of the encounter between the legal professionals from opposing parties. Debate (step 3: discuss the ethical issues surrounding the arrest): Campbell's arrest has led to a heated debate among legal professionals and the public alike, with some arguing that the paralegal's actions may constitute an ethical breach. Given her connection to Clem's legal team, it has been suggested that her purchasing drinks for Campbell could be an attempt to compromise his ability to effectively represent his client. Others, however, have come to the defense of both Campbell and the paralegal, arguing that the incident may be entirely innocuous. These individuals maintain that it is not uncommon for legal professionals to socialize outside of the courtroom and that there may be no malicious intent behind the paralegal's actions. Impact (step 4: consider the potential impact on the case): Regardless of the motive behind the encounter, it remains uncertain how Campbell's arrest may impact the ongoing defamation suit. With tensions already high in this high-stakes legal battle, this latest development could either delay the proceedings or potentially cause further complications in an already heated case. Conclusion (step 5: wrap up the article): As new details emerge surrounding the circumstances of Campbell's arrest, it will be interesting to see how this situation develops and what consequences may arise for both legal teams. Until then, observers of the case are left to speculate on the potential implications of this unexpected turn of events in the highly publicized lawsuit between radio personalities Todd \\"MJ\\" Schnitt and Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\" Clem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries.

Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Killing Joke are an English rock band formed in October 1978 in Notting Hill, London, England.

Article: Dieters' who eat meals high in protein might lose a bit more weight than those who get less protein and more carbohydrates  all other things being equal, a new analysis of past studies suggests. Researchers found that over an average of 12 weeks, people having a highprotein diet lost about 1.8 extra pounds, and more body fat, than those having a standard-protein diet. Wycherley from the University of South\\" Australia in Adelaide, the lead author on the study says it's possible that the body may spend more energy and bum more calories while dealing with protein, compared to carbohydrates. Another explanation for the link his team observed is that eating protein helps preserve muscle mass and muscle mass bums more calories, even when the body is resting, than other types of mass. He says people in the studies tend to get protein from a variety of animal and vegetable sources. Vegetable sources of protein include beans. It is not obvious why a higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratio might help people lose more pounds----and one obesity researcher not involved in the new analysis questioned whether the trials were strong enough to make that conclusion. \\"The studies are generally far too short to tell effect,\\" Dr. James Levine from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters Health in an e-mail. But given the limitations of the present evidence, Levine said, \\"It makes no real difference which of the weight-loss ways one chooses.\\" Question: What can we learn from the studies?

The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500. The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one. Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929, and 1944. When did a severe eruption happen 23 and 38 years after 1906?","output":"A severe eruption of Mount Vesuvius occurred in 1929, which is 23 years after the eruption in 1906.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 0 = 25974*c - 24250*c - 17240 for c.. What is the answer??","output":"Alright kiddo, imagine you have two groups of toy cars. In the first group, there are 25974 toy cars and in the second group, there are 24250 toy cars. You want to find out, how many more toy cars do you have in the first group than in the second group. To do this, you subtract the number of cars in the second group from the first group. So, you have 25974*c - 24250*c. To simplify this, just like when you put blocks together, you can regroup the toy cars. But instead of blocks, we deal with the number of cars. You would have (25974 - 24250) * c. Now, let's do the subtraction: 25974 - 24250 = 1724 So, now we have 1724 * c. The problem says that 1724 * c is equal to 17240. To figure out how many toy cars (c) we have, we need to divide 17240 by 1724. 17240 ÷ 1724 = 10 So, c = 10.  That means, you would have 10 more toy cars in the first group than in the second group!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the following context:  Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?","output":"The first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects, and ideas in Tosca is Giacomo.

A Spanish nurse who treated an Ebola victim in Madrid has become the first person in the world to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa. The 44-year-old is said to have spent the last 15 years working at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, where the two Spanish missionaries infected with Ebola died. The woman, who is married, was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus. Scroll down for video. The Spanish nurse has become the first person in the world to contract Ebola outside of Africa after treating a patient with the deadly virus at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital. Pictured: Police escort an ambulance with the nurse. The medical workers donned full protective clothing as they transported the nurse between Spanish hospitals. The 44-year-old Spanish woman was moved between the hospitals in a special fully-incubated stretcher. Medical staff could be seen removing the woman on an enclosed stretcher out of the ambulance last night. The woman has moved from Alcorcon Hospital to Madrid's Carlos III Hospital by those in full protective suits. A medical worker in protective gear stands next to a special stretcher carrying the infected Spanish nurse. Two separate tests confirmed that the woman, who has yet to be named, had contracted the disease. Colleagues tonight expressed their surprise at news that the nurse, from Galicia in northwest Spain, had caught the virus, saying that there had been 'extreme' measures in place to protect staff. One told Spanish daily El Pais that nurses were equipped with two protective overalls, two pairs of gloves and glasses. All medics had to use a special card to access the hospital's sixth floor - where the two men were treated. The Carlos III Hospital was evacuated before the arrival of the first missionary, Miguel Pajares, who contracted the disease in Liberia, but not for Mr Viejo as the sixth floor had already been hermetically sealed. Mr Pajares, the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital in August despite receiving experimental drug ZMapp after he returned. The Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus pictured. He died on September 26. Mr Viejo was a member of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios who worked in the Western city of Lunsar. Mr Viejo died at the hospital the following month after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone. Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the virus and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected. The current outbreak in west Africa, the worst ever, has infected nearly 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths. The Spanish nurse is understood to have tested positive for Ebola in a first analysis after going to hospital in Alcorcon near Madrid with a high fever early this morning. Doctors isolated the emergency treatment room. A Ministry of Health source told respected daily El Mundo: 'She arrived at the University Hospital Alcorcon Foundation with fever and has undergone tests. The first test has come back positive.' Spain's Health Ministry today held a crisis meeting as they awaited for the results to be confirmed. British nurse William Pooley, 29, who was infected with the virus while working in Sierra Leone, recovered last month after being flown back to London for treatment. He later jetted to the US to give blood to an American battling the disease. Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed in the west with the disease, contracted Ebola last month in Liberia and is now 'fighting for his life' at a hospital in Dallas after flying to the US to visit his fiancee. Spanish nurse, Manuel Garcia Viejo, is pictured being flown home from Sierra Leone in a plastic isolation chamber. It is understood that the female Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated him. The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are:. Leading charity Save the Children warned recently Ebola is spreading at a 'terrifying rate' with the number of recorded cases doubling every week. Speaking at a conference in London co-hosted with Sierra Leone last week, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for more financial aid, doctors and nurses. Scientists have warned that the deadly virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks. There is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted. Using Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24. And Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each. A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks. Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities – but those probabilities are growing for everyone. 'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky. 'Air traffic is the driver. 'But there are also differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability numbers change.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A Spanish nurse who treated an Ebola victim in Madrid became the first person in the world to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa. The 44-year-old nurse worked at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, where two Spanish missionaries infected with Ebola died. The nurse was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month to be treated for the virus. The Carlos III Hospital had extreme precautions in place, including evacuating the whole area and providing healthcare workers with protective overalls, gloves, and glasses. The current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has led to nearly 7,500 infections and caused more than 3,400 deaths. This incident has sparked a renewed urgency in containing the virus and prompted health officials to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures."},{"instruction":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Cleaning groundwater in an aquifer requires bioremediation or chemical remediation.

The story follows eleven passionate, mostly anonymous but very talented soccer players and their journey from the cobblestone streets of impoverished Belgrade neighborhoods to the formation of the national team before the very first World Cup in faraway Uruguay. So far away that the country's capital, Montevideo, seems more a distant dream than a familiar reality. Named after the city where the inaugural World Cup was held, director Dragan BjelogrliÄ's adaptation of journalist Vladimir StankoviÄ's best-selling book centers on the relationship between the two top players: natural talent and poor boy Tirke (MiloÅ¡ BikoviÄ) and playboy superstar MoÅ¡a (Petar Strugar). The two young men eventually become friends when they're thrown together on the front line of the dominant local team, Beogradski sport klub - BSK (BSK Belgrade). As the club hierarchy is faced with the challenge of keeping the squad afloat, the opportunity arises to create a national team. However, team unity is strained when Tirke and MoÅ¡a clash over beautiful women. Rosa (Danina JeftiÄ), the voluptuous, small-town innocent who adores Tirke, but her soccer-mad uncle conspires to set her up with MoÅ¡a; and vampish Valeria (Nina JankoviÄ), a free-spirited bohemian who seduces MoÅ¡a and finds much fun in pitting him against Tirke. The initial doubt that surrounded their personal and professional lives is transformed into a shared ambition to prove themselves in Montevideo; as a result, a story about friendship, enthusiasm, persistence and love for the game is unraveled. My question: Does Tirke love or hate football? A:","output":"Based on the movie plot provided, it is clear that Tirke loves football. He is described as a natural talent and a poor boy who is passionate about the sport. His journey from impoverished Belgrade neighborhoods to the formation of the national team highlights his dedication and enthusiasm for the game. Additionally, the story is about friendship, enthusiasm, persistence, and love for the game, which further emphasizes Tirke's love for football. Despite personal clashes and challenges, Tirke's ambition to prove himself in Montevideo showcases his unwavering passion for the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the premise does not provide any explicit information about any forces or actions between the two celestial bodies. The premise merely shares Jon's observation of the moons. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the red moon was pulling the black moon apart. This involves an active process or event occurring between the two moons. However, no such activity is included or suggested in the premise. There are no details in the premise related to the movement, force, or interaction between the red and black moons. It is only described how they appear visually, not what is happening between them. Furthermore, while the premise reveals Jon's relief or gratitude towards the gods, this does not provide any support for the hypothesis either. It gives insight into Jon's emotional or spiritual response, but does not contribute any information about physical or astronomical occurrences. In sum, the hypothesis entails an inference or assumption that goes beyond the scope of the description provided in the premise. The premise does not specify any sort of destructive or gravitational interaction between the two moons, as suggested by the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

Police arrest Georgia megachurch pastor after disturbance at home By John Murgatroyd and John Blake, CNN Atlanta (CNN)– Megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar was arrested in suburban Atlanta for an alleged assault on his 15-year-old daughter, police said Friday. Deputies in Georgia's Fayette County responded to a call about a domestic disturbance about 1 a.m. Friday. Dollar's daughter said she argued with her father over attending a party, said Investigator Brent Rowan of the Fayette County Sheriff's Office. The daughter says the argument got physical. She told the deputies that her father charged her, put his hands around her throat and began to choke her, according to a police report. She said he then slammed her to the ground, punched her and beat her with his shoe. CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories Dollar's daughter was able to get away and dial 911, Rowan said. Deputies noticed a scratch on the daughter's neck and arrested Dollar on charges of simple battery, family violence and child cruelty. Deputies also spoke with another daughter, 19, who corroborated her sister's account of what happened. Dollar was booked into the Fayette County jail early Friday. A judge set his bail at 5,000 during a morning hearing, and he was released. Dollar said in a statement released to the media from his attorney, \\"As a father I love my children and I always have their best interest at heart at all times, and I would never use my hand to ever cause bodily harm to my children. The facts in this case will be handled privately to further protect my children. My family thanks you for your prayers and continued support.\\" Dollar is a senior pastor of World Changers Church International in suburban Atlanta, which claims about 30,000 members and has an 18 million sanctuary that resembles a golden-domed spaceship atop a hill. He built an international religious empire, with broadcasts of his sermons beamed worldwide and speaking engagements in Europe. A barrel-chested man who favors impeccably tailored pinstripe suits in the pulpit, Dollar preaches the Prosperity Gospel, a message that says God will bless faithful Christians with wealth and debt-free living. Since he started his ministry in an elementary school cafeteria in 1986, Dollar has earned both praise and criticism. Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter Supporters say he has preached a message that's financially empowered his parishioners and challenged the idea that Christians should be ashamed to be rich. Critics call him \\"Cash-Flow Dollar,\\" a pulpit prima donna who once refused to allow parishioners to touch him. They say his message perverts the Gospel. Dollar has had brushes with the law before, according to a lengthy 2000 profile in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was once cited for contempt of court for refusing to give a deposition during the divorce proceedings of boxer Evander Holyfield, who attended his church, according to the AJC. The AJC profile also said that 100 police officers were admonished for receiving 1,000 apiece from Dollar. Dollar sent the money to honor the officers' community service, but the act was criticized because it came a month after two traffic tickets Dollar received were downgraded to warnings, the profile said.

Write a title for this article: Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech Conference (going on now in Aspen, Colo.) regularly brings together the best and brightest minds in tech innovation. Each week, Fortune turns the spotlight on a different conference attendee to offer his or her own personal insight into business, tech, and entrepreneurship. This week, we asked Chief Infotainment Officer at General Motors Philip Abram to answer 10 questions about life outside of work, the best advice he ever received, and industry tips for young entrepreneurs. His responses follow. What is the best advice you ever received? As a young engineer, I was advised to look for areas undergoing change and spend time on the “business side” of the company, because that is what drives decisions. I’ve spent my career close to that boundary between technology and business, the intersection of what is possible and what is profitable. What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market? Even in a tough market, follow your interests and passions. You’ll be happier and more valuable to your employer. What was the most important thing you learned in school? How to learn. How to process and retain new information and be able to apply it to solve new problems. My undergrad electrical engineering knowledge is quite dated after all these years. Every day I learn something new and incorporate that into how I tackle the issues that come my way. What do you do for fun? Get outside as much as I can (yes, even in Detroit!). Cycling, hiking, seeing our national and regional parks. What is your greatest achievement? Working on a team that rapidly grew a startup (Sonos) selling premium products during the worst economic downturn in over 50 years. Sonos grew more than 50% year-over-year in 2009 in a consumer electronics industry that was shrinking by 30% while we lowered our operating expenses. What has been your biggest failure? So many to choose from…Taking too long to realize what I’m good at and what I’m not good at. Not having good self-awareness limited what I could contribute to many of the jobs I’ve had in the past. Even positions that were “successful” in many ways, I did not do all I could have done. What technology sector excites you most? I am attracted to sectors undergoing significant change. That’s what is exciting about my role at General Motors. It is a new intersection of technology (connectivity) and business (auto industry) with so much opportunity. The user experience in the vehicle will undergo radical change in the next 3-5 years. What do you do to live a balanced life? Have fun at work and it’s not really work. We are building a new team within GM dedicated to the innovation of connected services in the vehicle. It is a new frontier for the company and we are attracting new talents. We have fun and hopefully it is reflected in our products. A desire to come to the office each day is key to a balanced life. What is one characteristic that every leader should possess? Given my answer on failures, self-awareness of one’s strengths and weaknesses. Build on your strengths, and surround yourself with people to mitigate your weaknesses. Find peers and mentors that are willing to help you see your weaknesses. Is business school necessary for entrepreneurs? Never necessary, but certainly beneficial. In particular, if you have a technical background, business school will round out your knowledge on how business operates. Every entrepreneur needs to understand how to make money from their ideas.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you wish to have full control of how fluid paint is dispersed onto your canvas, place it perfectly flat on your work surface. If you are aiming for a specific dripping effect, place the canvas upright or at an angle. Use an easel or prop the canvas up with something solid (e.g., a large piece of wood) to achieve the angle you want. Before starting your fluid painting, consider painting your plain canvas with one solid paint color (or “toned ground”) to make the end result look more professional. Use regular acrylic paint in an opaque color for this. Dip a large brush in the paint and cover the canvas in broad strokes from left to right, aiming to make the paint as smooth as possible. Let the canvas sit for 2-3 hours to dry before applying fluid paint to it. How paint disperses onto the canvas will depend on the method of application you use, the vessel you transfer it from, and the angle and distance at which you apply it. Most store-bought fluid paint is sold in squeeze bottles with small nozzles that allow you to dispense it in fine lines, but you can transfer the paint to any container you choose to create your artwork. Some techniques for getting fluid paint onto a canvas include:  Pouring (applying a generous stream of paint to the canvas) Drizzling (pouring very light stream of paint onto the canvas) Dropping (e.g., from an eye-dropper) Puddling (Applying a puddle of paint to the canvas and letting it seep over it) Splashing (Projecting paint onto the canvas with enough force to bounce back off of it) Depending on the design you wish to achieve, you can use spreading tools or a dry paintbrush to disperse fluid paint across your canvas. To ensure greater control, spread or move paint very lightly in multiple, thin coats. Have an empty container or basin on hand to collect excess paint from the canvas, if necessary, using a clean spreading tool. Make sure that your tools are perfectly clean before you start painting.Tools should always be cleaned with warm water and hand soap immediately after use, before paint dries on them. Fluid paint is a very wet medium and requires more drying time than other paints. If you wish to layer paint designs over other work on the canvas, allow one to three days between coats so that the layers can dry thoroughly. Painting over other fluid paint that hasn’t dried completely can cause cracks or fissures on the surface of the paint.","output":"To paint with fluid paint, first decide if you want your canvas flat or at an angle. If you want a drippy effect, prop up the canvas on something like a big piece of wood. Before starting, you can paint the canvas with a solid color to make it look more professional. Let it dry for 2-3 hours. There are many ways to put the paint on the canvas, like pouring a lot of paint, drizzling a little paint, using an eye-dropper, making a puddle of paint, or splashing the paint. You can use tools or a dry brush to help spread the paint around. You might want an empty container to catch extra paint that falls off the canvas. Clean your tools really well before and after painting, so they stay nice and clean. Fluid paint takes a long time to dry, so if you want more layers, wait 1-3 days between them to avoid cracking."},{"instruction":"Information:  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.

Movie title: 20 Million Miles to Earth Movie plot: Off the coast of a small Italian fishing village, Sperlonga (in the province of Latina), not Sicily as it is erroneously mentioned, two fishermen watch in amazement as a spaceship pierces the skies and crashes into the sea. The men, Mondello (Don Orlando) and Verrico (George Khoury), row out to the site and pull two space travelers from the capsized craft before it shudders and sinks into the sea. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Major General A. D. McIntosh (Thomas Browne Henry) discovers that the government's missing spacecraft, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder (William Hopper), has been located off the coast of Italy. As McIntosh flies to Italy, Pepe (Bart Braverman), a little boy who lives in the fishing village of Gerra, finds a metal capsule that has washed up on the beach. Upon opening the capsule, he finds a jelly-like glob inside and sells it to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia), a visiting zoologist who is studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's medical-student granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) is summoned to town to take care of the injured Calder and his companion, Dr. Sharman. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds Sharman in the last throes of the fatal disease that decimated his crew. That night, after Marisa returns home to the trailer that she shares with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the glob and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size, and McIntosh arrives in Gerra, accompanied by government scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with Calder and Signore Contino, a representative of the Italian government. As Leonardo and Marisa hitch up the trailer containing the creature to their truck and head for Rome with their discovery, McIntosh informs the astonished Contini that Calder has just returned from Venus. Calder's spacecraft, crippled by a meteor, carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn species of animal life from the planet.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

His exile lasted nearly a year and a half. Long before that time there had come a reaction in his favour. The new consuls were well disposed towards him; Clodius's insolence had already disgusted Pompey; Caesar was absent with his legions in Gaul; his own friends, who had all along been active in his favour (though in his querulous mood he accused them of apathy) took advantage of the change, his generous rival Hortensius being amongst the most active; and all the frantic violence of Clodius and his party served only to delay for a while the return which they could not prevent. A motion for his recall was carried at last by an immense majority. Cicero had one remarkable ally on that occasion. On one of the days when the Senate was known to be discussing his recall, the 'Andromache' of Ennius was being played in the theatre. The popular actor Esop, whose name has come down to us in conjunction with that of Roscius, was playing the principal character. The great orator had been his pupil, and was evidently regarded by him as a personal friend. With all the force of his consummate art, he threw into Andromache's lament for her absent father his own feelings for Cicero.

Write highlights for this article: A Texas coroner declared the death of an adopted Russian boy accidental, prompting Moscow to demand a complete report from U.S. officials. Max Shatto, 3, who was adopted from Russia, lived in Texas with his adoptive parents. He reportedly died on January 21. Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over the ruling about his death, saying it did not receive the information from U.S. officials, but from the media. It asked the United States to provide Russian consular representatives the relevant forensic documents, including a death certificate. \\"We presume that this is not a final conclusion of the investigation. Still expect from the U.S. authorities -- both Texas and federal, including the U.S. Department of State -- the most complete information on the progress and results of the inquiry,\\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A medical examiner in Ector County determined the death was caused by a laceration of a small bowel artery due to blunt trauma to the abdominal area, said District Attorney Bobby Bland. After Texas boy's death, Russian official continues call for ban on adoptions. The bruising was consistent with a \\"self-inflicted\\" injury, according to Bland. Toxicology reports were negative and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child's death. The sheriff's office said it is conducting more investigations with other agencies. The boy's death drew international attention after a Russian government child advocate said that the boy was \\"killed\\" or \\"murdered.\\" At a news conference last week, Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death. He acknowledged he may have spoken too soon. Still, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children. The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. Families in limbo after adoption ban. That law bans adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions. Highlights:","output":"1.

The 1,817 square kilometres (702 sq mi) of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to 1,342 km2 (518 sq mi) by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels. Forty percent of the glaciation in Austria has disappeared since 1850, and 30% of that in Switzerland. Answer:","output":"The Alps had more area covered by glaciers in 1876 than in 1973.

The first thing you notice about New York's Ellis Island hospital is its sheer scale. Twenty-two buildings are perched proudly on the island's south side, their original vocations ranging from maternity ward, to psychiatric unit, to the contagious disease wing. The Ellis Island hospital complex, used between 1902 and 1930, was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore. Here, within view of the Statue of Liberty, babies were born, people died, and a constant stream of patients with new illnesses arrived. It was the biggest public health initiative the U.S. had ever attempted and now, it is open to the public for the first time in 60 years. The hospital's record is impressive. No epidemic on the U.S. mainland was ever attributed to an immigrant that came through its checking system. \\"There were fears of epidemics\\" the museum historian Barry Moreno told me. Cholera had broken out in New York in the 1890s, and \\"there were fears of smallpox...and typhus. But there was no epidemic that ever stemmed from here.\\" The hospital, he added, \\"played a very big role in screening immigrants.\\" The second thing that hits you is the hospital complex's authenticity. It looks like the dust has settled on a fire drill, from which no one returned. Single stools are left overturned. Buckets are left on top of closets, and bed frames lie rusty but intact in corners. The complex has survived extreme elements. Two years ago hurricane Sandy crippled the north side of the Island, closing the immigration museum there for a year. But the hospital stood firm, testament to a time when buildings were built \\"very sturdily,\\" Moreno says. One of the volunteer tour guides at the hospital, Tony Mrozinski, takes me into the morgue, where raked concrete benches tower over the area where autopsy tables once stood. \\"People always ask me,\\" he says, \\"when the concrete was restored. I tell them: 'it wasn't.'\\" The third thing you notice is what makes this place so addictive to the curious visitor. It's the blend of adversity and opportunity. Patients were subject to suffering and humiliation, but they received top-class treatment and the opportunity of a new life. Ellis Island has been described as an island of hope, an island of tears -- and the two fit in the same breath. This is not only a halfway house between origin and destination, but between captivity and free will, sickness and health. As part of its opening, the hospital French artist JR has created an installation inside its brick maze. JR has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors, enlarging them to life-size and pasting them on the crumbling walls, windows and doors. Janis Calella, president of the government-funded Save Ellis Island group, says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital \\"evoke some sort of an emotion,\\" making it easier to support the work. Permanent exhibitions are not permitted by the National Parks Service, which runs Ellis Island, and the images can be peeled off if required. However, there are no plans to do so, Calella says. The exhibition \\"will last here for as long as it lasts.\\" she says. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Harry Connick, Jr. and Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban on ‘American Idol’ panel Fox has confirmed that Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick, Jr. will join Keith Urban on the judging panel for the 13th season of “American Idol.” Lopez has been a judge on the popular television singing contest before. Connick was previously a mentor on the show, coaching and accompanying the singers. Fox also announced other changes to the show’s cast: Urban’s return to the contest was announced last month by Fox Chairman Kevin Reilly, who said the singer didn’t get a chance to show his personality in his first turn as a judge. Urban appeared overwhelmed last season by the Carey-Minaj crossfire that drew complaints from some viewers. “I think this season of ‘Idol’ is gonna be a blast,” Urban said in a statement Tuesday. “New team, new energy and a whole new field of artists to be discovered and given a chance!” Fox also announced that original judge Randy Jackson, who exited along with Carey and Minaj at the end of last season, will be back in a new role as in-house mentor to the contestants. Ryan Seacrest, also part of “Idol” from the start, will again host. “Surprise, surprise! I am so happy to be back as part of this amazing show that started it all,” said Jackson. “The original talent show is back with a vengeance and ready to discover the best talent in America.” Record executive Jimmy Iovine had served as mentor in recent seasons. Fox said that Universal Music Group’s Interscope Records, under Iovine’s direction as chairman, will continue to release “Idol” winner and contestant music. “Idol” has been declining in popularity, and the show’s producers might be hoping that viewers will find the new judging panel more likable: If you noticed the buzz about this news is considerably smaller than in years past, well, that’s not surprising. First, both names have been rumored for days. And second, “Idol” ratings have been consistently falling; the show suffered its least-watched ever this past spring, when Candice Glover was named the winner. Anyway, Connick Jr. has finally given in — his name has long been batted around as a potential judge, as he’s appeared on the show before as one of the most compelling celebrity mentors, and genuinely seemed to enjoy his time with the contestants. J-Lo returns for her second stint after playing judge Seasons 10 and 11. She took a break this past year, which featured the most judge-centric season in “Idol” history, as dueling divas Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj made the show all about them, while Keith Urban and Randy Jackson tried to stay out of the way. As a mentor, Connick was more dedicated to the singers than the other celebrities, Lisa de Moraes wrote when he appeared on the show in 2010: Connick, a.k.a. New Blue Eyes, treated his “Idol” gig as seriously as jury duty, in marked contrast to all those drive-by mentors who spent as little time as possible in the company of the Idolettes, preferring to simply use them as props for album-plugging.. . . “What I’m trying to do is feature the contestants by writing a supportive arrangement,” Connick said during a taped bit in which he was seen at the ivories, tickling out one of the arrangements for Tuesday’s performance show. “I should be lying by the pool. Do you think Shania Twain was up in here doing this?” he said, about last week’s phone-it-in mentor. Props to Connick for the first cross-mentor snipe in “Idol” history. And, by the way, for actually watching the show and knowing who was the previous week’s mentor -- you think quasi-mentor Usher knew he followed quasi-mentor Miley Cyrus? Me neither. The five down-to-the-wire Idolettes -- Aaron Kelly, Casey James, Michael Lynche, Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze -- couldn’t stop talking about how funny, helpful, available and downright heroic Connick was, after that steady trail of see-ya-wouldn’t-wanna-be-ya mentors to whom they’d been subjected.

Since it was first confirmed at a Buckinghamshire nursery in March, the number of cases has slowly increased. And in late October, ecologists' fears were realised when an important barrier was breached - it was found in the wider environment and the UK's 80 million ash trees were at risk. The news last month that the disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, had been found in woodlands in East Anglia prompted Mr Paterson to impose an import ban on ash trees, and to carry out a nationwide survey to find out how far the disease had spread. He also convened an emergency summit, bringing together \\"key stakeholders\\", to consider what could be done. The resulting action plan, agreed at an emergency Cobra meeting, outlined where the government would focus its efforts. The plan seems to be pinning a great deal of hope on scientists finding natural resistance within the UK's population of ash trees. Once identified, researchers would then look to grow the next generation of ash trees that would be resilient to the pathogen. One of the government's leading scientists, Prof Ian Boyd, is optimistic. He told journalists: \\"By next season, we could potentially have resistant forms of ash growing in this country.\\" Mind the gap But ash trees, while considered fast-growing within the world of hardwood trees, take decades to reach maturity and produce the seeds that would sow naturally resistant trees. In the interim, ash dieback will continue to spread and trees would continue to become infected and not be replaced, as Dr Pocock explained. How ash dieback could threaten Britain's wildlife \\"Those that are susceptible to the disease will get hit, and those that are not or less susceptible will go on and will be able to fruit. That is the process of natural selection,\\" he told BBC News. \\"But the process of natural selection on trees will operate on much longer timescales. \\"If there was a disease that affected an annual plant, the selection pressure on that plant would be such that you would get resistance, and then you would get the spread of the resistant [offspring of the plant]. \\"You would see a dip in that species population for a couple of years, and then it would be likely to recover,\\" Dr Pocock explained. \\"You would expect to see the same thing in trees, but the timescale is at least decades rather than months or years.\\" So would ecosystems be able to cope with the loss of ash trees from the landscape while the naturally resistant trees matured? RSPB forestry officer Nick Phillips said UK woodlands were already in trouble. \\"The important point to remember here is that woodland wildlife is already in crisis,\\" he told BBC News. \\"One in six woodland flowers is threatened with extinction. Our woodland butterflies have halved since the 1990s. Many of our woodland birds have declined by 70% or more. \\"This is not the result of tree disease, this is something that has already been going on for some time. \\"Our woodland wildlife is already stressed and we don't know yet what effect additional stress will have on it.\\" Mission impossible And the outbreak is already shaping the future, as tree managers weigh up the risk of planting ash in woodlands. This year saw the Woodland Trust create 59 Diamond Woods and its flagship 460-acre (186ha) Diamond Park in Leicestershire to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. How to spot the signs A spokesman told BBC News that, in light of the news that the disease was here to stay, the Trust had taken the decision that it would suspend planting ash saplings and substitute them with other native species. He added that now that the planting season was opening, there were plans to plant three million trees over the coming months. \\"As it stands, we are running all tree planting events as normal. We will substitute any ash saplings for either oak, birch or possible shrubs such as hazel, dependent on the location and what fits best within the current landscape.\\" And the concern about planting new ash trees is spreading. Brighton is famed for being home to veteran elms that did not fall victim to the outbreak of Dutch elm disease, thanks to the combination of the city's geographical location and a very robust tree management regime. However, a spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove Council said such an approach would not work to prevent ash dieback infecting trees. \\"The recent outbreak of ash dieback is spread by the wind, and this type of dispersal is impossible to protect against. \\"At present, we are not purchasing any ash trees and would avoid the species until we know more about the disease.\\" So until scientists make a breakthrough and can propagate ash dieback-resistant trees, the situation for ash - a popular street tree - is likely to get worse before it gets better. Ash is one of just 30-odd native tree species, making the thought of losing it from the landscape a difficult pill to swallow for many people. \\"It is very difficult to predict what the impact will be if ash dieback is as serious as the worst fears,\\" Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ecologist Michael Pocock observed. \\"The vast majority if not all ecologists will be [recording the spread and impact of the disease] with a heavy heart because, ultimately, we are not ecologists to chart the progress of doom - we are ecologists because we care about the environment and we want to do something positive.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the spread of ash dieback disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, which is threatening the UK's 80 million ash trees. It mentions the government's efforts to combat the disease, including import bans, nationwide surveys, and emergency summits. Scientists are trying to find natural resistance within the UK's population of ash trees, hoping to eventually grow a new generation of ash trees that would be resilient to the pathogen. However, the article also highlights the challenges faced due to the long maturity period of ash trees, which will continue to be infected in the meantime. The potential loss of ash trees from the landscape raises concerns for ecosystems and the decline of woodland wildlife.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban  areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three. If things go well over those three years, they return to help build another school for grades four to six, and then set up evening adult literacy classes. Ramatou and Mariam will not learn inside the walls of build On school since they are already in the sixth grade, but Samake hopes that they will be able to attend evening classes to continue learning.

Q: where does the saying calling the kettle black come from? A:","output":"The saying \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\" is an English idiomatic phrase or proverb that describes the act of accusing another while being guilty of the same fault or something similar. Its initial usage and development are traced back to literature of the 17th century.  The phrase's origin is rooted in the old days when most cooking pots and kettles were forged from heavy metals like cast iron, copper, or even in tripods made of iron or brass. These utensils were placed directly over the fire to cook food or boil water. Consequently, pots and kettles grew dark and tarnished due to the continual exposure to fire and smoke, regardless of what they were initially made from; hence the concept of the \\"black\\" pot and kettle. The first known appearance of this phrase in literature dates back to 1620, in Thomas Shelton's translated version of Spanish novel named \\"Don Quixote\\" by Cervantes. The phrase was written as, \\"You are like what is said that the frying-pan said to the kettle, 'Avant, black-browes'\\". The word 'Avant' is an old version of 'avaunt,' which meant 'go away' or 'get out of the way' in Middle English. The exact phrasing we commonly use today, \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\", is witnessed around the mid-17th century. It appeared in William Penn's work \\"Some Fruits of Solitude\\" from 1693, where he writes, \\"A Covetous man to a prodigal, says, the pot calls the kettle black.\\" It is then found in numerous other texts, steadily cementing its place in English literature and the English language. The proverb metaphorically conveys that the accuser is to be similarly criticised for something they accuse another of, similar to saying that someone is being hypocritical. Over time, the phrase became renowned globally, manifesting across various cultures but maintaining its profound message about pointing out others' flaws while overlooking one's own. Such is the rich history and diverse cultural interpretation of the saying, \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His boss asked him to figure out problems in two similar programs, program A and program B. John found program A having parallel slowdown, but program B does not have parallel slowdown. He has to weigh the merits of using these programs.  Would program B be slower or faster than program A? Answer:","output":"To determine whether program B would be slower or faster than program A, it is essential to understand the term \\"parallel slowdown\\" and the implications it has on a program's performance. Parallel slowdown refers to the situation where a program takes longer to execute on a parallel computing system with multiple processors than it would on a single processor. This can happen for various reasons such as increased communication overhead between processors, contention for shared resources, or load imbalance among processors. Now let's compare program A and program B: Program A: Experiences parallel slowdown, which means it takes longer to execute on a parallel computing system than it would on a single processor. There are potential inefficiencies in the way tasks are divided among the processors or in communication between them. As a result, it may not utilize all available processing power effectively. Program B: Does not have parallel slowdown, which implies that it effectively utilizes the parallel computing system. Program B can distribute tasks more evenly among the processors and has better communication between them. Consequently, the program can take advantage of all available processing power. When comparing the two programs on a parallel computing system, program B is expected to be faster than program A because it does not experience parallel slowdown. It can efficiently use the processing power of multiple processors, while program A's performance might suffer due to its inefficiencies in task distribution and communication overhead.  However, keep in mind that this conclusion holds when considering a parallel computing system. If the programs were to be executed on a single processor, the performance difference might vary depending on their respective algorithmic complexities and any other inherent optimization factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      Sprint also provided important updates on the iPhone, its financing needs and planned network upgrades, undoing some of the damage caused by an investor day presentation three weeks ago that had investors fuming and sent its stock plunging.      Its stock edged lower Wednesday as investors continued to focus on finances that look precarious for the next two years.      The country's No. 3 wireless carrier said it added a net 1.3 million subscribers in the July to September period, the best result since 2006. Sprint continued to lose subscribers from its lucrative contract-based plans, but at a relatively low rate: 44,000 in the quarter.      Sprint's total customer count, 53.4 million, is now back at where it was in 2007, before the exodus of Nextel customers turned into a torrent.      The Overland Park, Kan.-based company has made steady gains in the last year and a half. Unfortunately for the company, most of the new customers are low-paying ones. They buy service from Sprint's low-cost Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile or Assurance Wireless brands, or from non-Sprint brands that use the company's network.      The latest subscriber results don't include the effect of the iPhone, which Sprint started selling Oct. 14. The phone is expected to further improve the carrier's ability to keep customers, but at a high price. Apple charges about 600 for a phone that Sprint sells for 200.      Chief Financial Officer Joe Euteneuer said each iPhone will cost the company about 200 more than another smartphone. All the same, the company expects its four-year purchasing agreement with Apple to add 7 billion to 8 billion to its own bottom line.      CEO Dan Hesse compared getting the iPhone to signing a star baseball player to the \\"Sprint team.\\"      \\"He has an expensive contract, but he's worth every penny,\\" said Hesse, who often draws on sports analogies.      The problem for Sprint is that the cost of selling the iPhone comes up front, while the benefits, like higher service fees and lower service costs, accrue over time. Sprint doesn't expect the iPhone to be a moneymaker until 2014.      The added cost of the iPhone comes as Sprint is also starting to revamp its network for higher speeds. That adds up to financing needs of 5 billion to 7 billion in the next few years, Euteneuer said.      Sprint hopes to cover the gap by refinancing 4 billion debt coming due, Hesse said. The remaining 1 billion to 3 billion could be raised in the form of financing from the companies Sprint buying its new network equipment from: Samsung Electronics Co., Alcatel-Lucent and LM Ericsson AB.      Euteneuer said the terms of the deal with Apple are confidential, but said there's a minimum commitment to buy 15.5 billion in iPhones over four years. That works out to about 25 million phones, a figure in line with a report in The Wall Street Journal early this month that the company had committed to buying 30 million iPhones over four years.      Figures on the effect of the iPhone on Sprint's finances were missing from the presentation on Oct. 7, contributing to investor consternation. On Wednesday, Euteneuer apologized for not providing more information then.      Also Wednesday, Sprint said it had raised the limit on its credit line by 150 million and amended the terms so that an increase in the total amount of phone discounts doesn't affect its creditworthiness. It said it had 1 billion undrawn on the line.      Sprint's net loss was 301 million, or 10 cents per share, for the third quarter. That's down from 911 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago. It was the best performance by Sprint since it reported a profit of 64 million in the third quarter of 2007.      Revenue rose 2.2 percent to 8.3 billion.      Analysts polled by FactSet expected a loss of 22 cents per share on 8.4 billion in revenue.      Sprint shares slipped 19 cents, or 7 percent, to close at 2.51 Wednesday. Two weeks ago, they hit a three-year low of 2.10.      Hesse also said the company has started discussions with Clearwire Corp. on how to make Sprint phones compatible with Clearwire's planned new wireless data network, and a discussions on commercial arrangements are ongoing. That sent Clearwire shares up 32 cents, or 20 percent, to close at 1.96.      Sprint owns 54 percent of Clearwire and uses its current data network for \\"Sprint 4G\\" service. But it doesn't control Clearwire's board, and the relationship between the two management teams has been cool.      Earlier this month, Sprint said it would stop selling phones compatible with Clearwire's current data network at the end of next year, with no mention of plans to use the planned \\"LTE\\" or \\"Long-Term Evolution\\" network. That sent Clearwire shares into a dive.      Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Sprint third-quarter results were \\"fairly good.\\" If the company can straighten out its network strategy and its Clearwire relationship, investors might start to look past the financing needs of the next two years and toward the benefits that should kick in in 2014, he said.      \\"For the first time in a year, expectations are appropriately low, and there are now at least a few glimmers of hope,\\" Moffett said. |||||","output":"Sprint Nextel Corp has reported its smallest quarterly loss in four years as the carrier continues its turnaround efforts and improves customer retention and attraction.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Get an ice cube tray - Fill the tray with cool water - Place the tray in the freezer - Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - Take they tray out of the freezer - Pop the ice cubes out of tray.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person needs ice for a barbecue happens, how will it affect Less trays are filled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that a person needs ice for a barbecue, which may result in less trays being filled. Step 2: Identify possible direct effects If less trays are filled, there will be fewer ice cubes available. This could directly affect the amount of ice needed for the barbecue. Step 3: Identify possible indirect effects Fewer filled ice cube trays could indirectly affect how long it takes to produce enough ice for the barbecue if additional ice needs to be made. Step 4: Determine the overall impact on the process The perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the ice-making process. The direct effect is that there will be fewer ice cubes to use immediately, which may be insufficient for the barbecue. The indirect effect is that it will take more time to produce enough ice, since multiple rounds of ice cube tray filling and freezing may be required. Conclusion: Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both directly (fewer ice cubes) and indirectly (more time needed to produce enough ice)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Chicago Bears: Former offensive coordinator Mike Tice downplays rift with quarterback Jay Cutler The noise inside Mike Tice's suburban Seattle home can be deafening these days. The former Bears offensive coordinator isn't bothered by the commotion. He knew what was in store when he huddled with his wife, Diane, and decided to use their newfound free time to remodel. \\"You might hear a bunch of screaming and drilling in a minute,'' Tice cautioned during a recent phone interview. \\"In fact, my contractor is banging on the door right now. I've got to go make some decisions. These are the only decisions I make now ... how far tile is going to go.'' Unfortunately for Tice, he wasn't a part of the Bears' rebuilding project. After coach Lovie Smith was fired on New Year's Eve, Tice and the rest of the assistant coaches were left in limbo. New coach Marc Trestman retained two of them — Jon Hoke (defensive backs) and Mike Phair (defensive line) — while four others quickly landed other NFL jobs. Tice, meanwhile, is one of four offensive coaches from Smith's staff who remain out of work. He was relieved of his duties Jan. 17 with one year on his contract, and the Bears owe him about 1 million. \\"Everyone says: 'But you get paid. You've got a contract,' \\" Tice said. \\"For me, the thrill of going in and trying to create something and the thrill of trying to get better is what it's all about.'' Tice approached every practice with the mind-set of moving forward, even if statistics showed his offense took a step back. A recent report alleged Tice and quarterback Jay Cutler were so much at odds last season that backup quarterback Josh McCown had to act as a liaison. A sideline incident in Dallas, where Cutler angrily walked away after Tice sat down and tried to explain something to him, would seem to back such a claim. But Tice said that incident was the only true rift he had with Cutler. \\"In regard to the comments that are out there about there being an intermediary between Jay Cutler and (me) because of a lack of communication, there wasn't a week that went by last year where Jay and I did not communicate,'' Tice said. \\"I never felt at all that there was ever a point in the season that Jay didn't support what I was trying to do.'' Tice would rather put his Bears stint in the past and look ahead to the next opportunity. He spoke with Chiefs coach Andy Reid about becoming the team's offensive line coach. Tice spent two seasons coaching the Bears line before being elevated to coordinator. \\"I thought I had a shot at that job,'' Tice said. \\"During the course of the interview, I recommended a guy I worked with, Andy Heck. And Andy got the job instead.'' Tice figured he had a chance with the Cowboys when offensive line coach Bill Callahan was promoted to offensive coordinator. A position never materialized — Callahan will oversee the line while assuming play-calling duties — so Tice had to conjure up a different strategy. \\"We said we were going to move out to Seattle and kind of regroup and join the YMCA and try to get back in shape,'' Tice said. \\"I wanted to spend some quality time with Diane and see how a normal person gets up in the morning and plans things without having to go through all those hours.'' An open schedule allowed Tice to revisit one of his other loves: horse racing. He attended the Kentucky Derby and even walked his friend Mike Pegram's horse Fiftyshadesofhay to the winner's circle after the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes in Baltimore. \\"That was fun, but other than that, I'm usually just shoveling black rock in my driveway,'' Tice said. \\"I'm just a normal guy trying to stay busy.'' Time away from football has allowed Tice to reflect on what he could have done better as a coach. He connected with his linemen with a hard-line approach and charmed the media with his comedic monologues. Yet critics will point to his struggles as a first-time coordinator. The Bears finished 28th out of 32 teams in total offense, 29th in passing offense and 22nd in third-down efficiency. \\"Anytime you fail at something, you always want to take a look at why you failed,'' Tice said. \\"I always try to correct Mike Tice before I try to correct somebody else. I learned a lot of lessons from it. I don't really want to go into them. \\"I would sum it up like this: Sometimes in life, we find ourselves trying to get along and trying to please as opposed to being who we really are.'' Tice realizes the Bears' offensive identity strongly contributed to Smith's firing. He knows Smith had his back even through the most trying times. \\"I loved working for Lovie Smith,'' Tice said. \\"(He) is a man of honor. (He) never blamed anyone for failure. He always took it head on and put himself first as the guy who had to get better. And I admired that about him. Not every single guy is willing to take the bullet.'' Tice still wants to take a shot at coaching, although his outlook toward the profession has changed. The former Vikings head coach reflected on how he helped a \\"baby'' grow in former Bears guard Lance Louis, now with the Dolphins. \\"I would love to be an offensive line coach moving forward,'' Tice said. \\"My aspirations of being a head coach are not going to drive me. What's going to drive me is working with a group of guys and developing an offensive line. That is where my energy, my enthusiasm is. \\"With that said, I'm out of work. If someone said, 'Hey, you want to coach tight ends?' I'm a good tight ends coach too, you know?'' What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. Former Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Mike Tice downplays rift with quarterback Jay Cutler, stating that there was only one true rift between them and they communicated every week during the season. 2.

According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"When Go Set a Watchman begins, Scout is in New York and travels to Maycomb, Alabama to visit her father, Atticus Finch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The selfish Aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat that Lilja and her mother had lived in, while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilja. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for cash, but Lilja does not join her. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and implicates Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. She finally decides to become a prostitute to support herself. She forms a close, protective relationship with her friend Volodya, himself the victim of abuse. She buys Volodya a basketball, but Volodya's father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She meets Andrei who becomes her boyfriend and offers her a job in Sweden.

Notorious mob boss James \\"Lucky\\" Lombardi looks back upon his life and career on the night of his execution. The flashbacks picks up when Lucky, born and raised on the Balkan Peninsula, tries to marry into money and goes to the U.S. to find himself a wealthy bride. He has no luck, despite his name, and instead makes an attempt to bluff his way forward, pretending to be count De Kloven, a rich aristocrat. As De Kloven, Lucky gets hired to escort the prominent socialite Mrs. Lola Morgan, but quits when she wants him to be her lover. Instead he tries a new disguise, as Rudolph Von Hertsen, and gets involved in another racket with a Dr. J.M. Randall, performing abortions and selling unwanted babies. When the racket is disclosed, Lucky moves on to the business of pimping young women  into prostitution. He goes as far as to trick naive young women into laying their lives in his hands, selling them as sex-slaves, thus entering into the business of white slavery. He soon becomes the head of such an organization. His right-arm man, Nick goes to lengths to get new merchandise for the business, and kidnaps Dorothy, a young, blonde schoolgirl.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Boil salt water - The water will turn into water vapor - Collect the water vapor - Allow the water vapor to cool - The water vapor will turn into liquid water - The salt will be separated from the water.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are no more trays left happens, how will it affect more water will remain with the salt.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are no more trays left to collect water vapor, it will disrupt the process of desalination, as the water vapor cannot be effectively separated from the salt. The process mentioned is a simplified version of distillation, a technique used to separate mixtures based on differences in their boiling points, which is often used for desalinating salt water. The steps are as follows: 1. Boil salt water: Heating the salt water causes it to evaporate, turning into water vapor. 2. Collect the water vapor: Usually, this is done using a condensation apparatus, such as trays or a cooling tube, which captures the water vapor. 3. Allow the water vapor to cool: The water vapor condenses back into liquid water as it cools down. 4. The water vapor turns into liquid water: As the vapor temperature drops, it condenses into droplets of pure water. 5. The salt is separated from the water: The salt particles are too heavy to evaporate, so they remain in the boiling container. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, if there are no more trays left to collect the water vapor, it will lead to the following consequences: - The water vapor will not be effectively captured, which will make it difficult to separate clean water from salt. - The condensed water droplets may mix back with the salty water, diluting the efficiency of the entire process. - More water will remain mixed with the salt, reducing the overall volume of purified water collected. In summary, the lack of trays to collect water vapors is an indirect factor that disrupts the water desalination process and leads to less purified water being collected, as it makes the separation process less efficient."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film begins with June's short narrative prologue about the swan feather in the opening credits and then her farewell surprise party in San Francisco for June's upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China.

These questions are not the same. Each question has a different topic and addresses different issues. Let us discuss each question and how they differ from one another. The first question asks about a funny TV program involving DIY paper-made cars. People compete in this show to see if they can successfully fly their paper cars over water without falling into it. This TV program is focused on entertainment and creativity. It involves participants designing and building their vehicles and then testing their creations in a fun and lively setting. On the other hand, the second question revolves around a hypothetical situation where only one or two people are left on Earth, and the availability of utilities like water and electricity for those remaining individuals is being questioned. Specifically, it explores whether a water tower would continue to supply water and if a house with a generator would still produce power. The first question's primary purpose is to draw attention to an amusing and whimsical TV program, whereas the second question is more concerned with the practical matter of survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Furthermore, the second question raises a multitude of complex issues related to infrastructure, resource availability, and human ingenuity in the face of adversity. In the theoretical scenario, water towers may initially provide water, but without proper maintenance, the quality of water would likely deteriorate over time due to contamination and infrastructure breakdown. Similarly, a home generator could continue to supply electricity, depending on its fuel source and ability to maintain the generator for an extended period. In summary, the two questions are indeed different. The first question concerns a humorous TV program about DIY paper-made cars, while the second question ponders the availability of essential utilities in a post-apocalyptic scenario.

Addams Family Values is a dark comedy directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and is a sequel to the 1991 hit film \\"The Addams Family.\\" The distinguished Addams Family characters were initially created by Charles Addams, a renowned cartoonist from the United States, featured in The New Yorker magazine. The eccentric and macabre family went on to inspire a television series, animated series, and several movies. In \\"Addams Family Values,\\" Amanda Buckman is a perky, bright, but somewhat cruel and snobbish camp-goer at Camp Chippewa, which the Addams siblings Wednesday (played by Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (played by Jimmy Workman) attend. The character Amanda is emblematic of everything the sinister Addams oppose, with her being an upbeat and conventional \\"all-American girl.\\" Throughout the movie, Amanda Buckman serves as a stark contrast to the morbid and deadpan personalities exhibited by the Addams family. One of the highlights of the film is the interaction between the two polar-opposite characters – Amanda Buckman and Wednesday Addams – in scenes where the two young girls are often at odds with each other, leading to memorable confrontations and exchanges.

Choices:  - other times of day  - different places  - other eras  - different times  A: Answer:","output":"A: Different times Dizygotic twins, also known as fraternal twins or non-identical twins, develop when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm cells. This results in two embryos that share a womb but may not share the same genetic material, as siblings born from different pregnancies. Because dizygotic twins have the same genetic similarity as siblings born at different times, they are not more identical than children from the same parents who are born at different times. This means that these twins can have varying degrees of similarity in their physical appearance, temperament, and other characteristics. It is also possible for dizygotic twins to have different genders, unlike monozygotic (identical) twins who always have the same gender. Siblings, whether dizygotic twins or not, share approximately 50% of their DNA, as they inherit half of their genetic material from each parent. Given that genetic similarities in dizygotic twins are no greater than those in siblings born years apart, it could be said that dizygotic twins are essentially siblings who just happened to be born at the same time. To address the other choices from the question: - Other times of day: The time of day has no impact on the genetic similarity between siblings or twins. - Different places: Genetic similarity is not influenced by the location where the child is born. - Other eras: Genetic similarity between siblings remains constant regardless of when they were born. Differences in environment, societal norms, or technologies may create differences in appearance, health, or behavior, but the underlying genetic relationship is unchanged. In conclusion, dizygotic twins are no more identical or similar than siblings born at different times, as they share roughly the same amount of genetic material. Their similarities and differences lie in the fact that they develop in the same womb during the same pregnancy, experiencing a similar environment during gestation. However, the genetic makeup of dizygotic twins is not more identical than that of other biological siblings who share the same parents but are born at different times."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She was 35 years old and lived in a place called Wolverhampton. Nina was very tall, standing at 5 feet 10 inches, and she weighed only 8 stones. However, people kept telling her that she was too big to become a model. This made Nina very sad and worried, so she decided to starve herself, meaning she didn't eat enough food to be healthy. After some time, Nina realized that what she was doing to her body was not good. She was making herself sick by not eating enough. So, Nina made a very important decision. Instead of continuing to starve herself, she decided to gain weight naturally. This means she started eating healthy foods and taking care of her body. As Nina began to take better care of herself, she grew bigger and became a size 18. Instead of feeling sad about her size, Nina decided to embrace it and show the world that beauty comes in different shapes and sizes. This was a very brave thing to do! Nina then started working as a plus-size model. A plus-size model is someone who models clothes for people who are bigger in size. Nina became very successful in her new job. She worked for big companies like Evans, M&S, House of Fraser, and Harrods, which made her very happy. Today, Nina Blakemore is not only a successful model, but she is also an inspiration to other people who may be struggling with their weight or trying to fit into a certain mold.

In the past, only a few specialists in a company were needed to communicate with foreign businesses.However, in these days of multinational companies, where workers are required to communicate with other employees from several countries, a common language is essential and English has become the logical choice. Nowadays, even blue-collar workers in many companies are required to speak English.For example, just over three years ago, a Dutch company.United Pan-European Communications (UPC), was contracted to build a TV studio in Amsterdam.The job involved many electricians--more than the company could find in the Netherlands.There were plenty of qualified electricians in nearby France and Belgium, but the American and Dutch executives of UPC wanted everyone on the job to speak and understand the same language.So, the UPC hired British electricians and flew them to Amsterdam every Monday, accommodating them in hotels all over the city, and flying them home on Friday evenings. Increasingly, workers who can speak English earn salaries 25-35% higher than those who can' t.They are also eligible   for a wider range of high-level jobs. The problem is that, while the ability to speak English is fast becoming essential for getting a good job, there is a shortage of people who can speak it.According to a recent European Commission report, only about 41% of continental Europeans can speak English, and only 29% speak it well enough to carry on a conversation.Many companies are solving this problem by setting up English language schools within the workplace.English language schools all over Europe are expanding at a huge rate, and governments are looking at ways to improve English tuition in schools.

Here's how you can do that: Step 1: Subtract the constant term (21259) from both sides of the equal sign. This is to eliminate the constant on the left side and isolate the term with the variable, \`d\`. \`915d + 21259 - 21259 = 16684 - 21259\` This simplifies to: \`915d = -4575\` Step 2: After doing this subtraction, divide each side of the equation by the coefficient of \`d\`, which is \`915\`. This is to get \`d\` alone on one side. \`915d / 915 = -4575 / 915\` This simplifies to: \`d = -5\` Therefore, the solution to the equation \`915*d + 21259 = 16684\` for \`d\` is \`d = -5\`."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Article: With just a few minutes left before school was to start, my six-year-old, Dustin, was crying. \\"I don't want to go,\\" he said.

However he gave his wife a life interest which means she can stay in the house as long as she wants to so i share the house with her. Bit of backstory, everyone HATES his wife because she treated my family like shit for over 20 years. A few weeks ago my mother came by the house because she wanted to take one of his TVs to her house and the widow threw a tantrum, openly disrespecting my mother and threatening to call the police if she didn't leave. My mother told her she didn't want any trouble she just wanted the TV which was rightfully hers and that would be it. A lawyer came and settled it and my mother took the TV and that was that. Yesterday she sent my mother a cease and desist letter at her workplace as well as a restraining order preventing my mother from coming near the house.

The grandfather's will clearly outlines the division of property, and AUTHOR has the legal right to sell the house, although the wife has a life interest. It might be worth considering alternative solutions or arrangements before selling the house, as selling it may potentially leave the wife with no place to live, further escalating the conflict.

Common special reasons include: Is this statement correct \\"can you own a handgun in new zealand\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"can you own a handgun in New Zealand?\\" is correct. Law-abiding citizens in New Zealand can own handguns, but the process is highly regulated and requires obtaining appropriate endorsements. Firearms licensing in New Zealand is administered by the New Zealand Police, which implements strict controls on ownership, usage, and storage of firearms in the interest of public safety. To own a handgun in New Zealand, a person must first apply for a firearms license. Obtaining a firearms license involves a thorough procedure, including a fit and proper person test, background check, attendance of a firearms safety course, and a home security inspection. The standard firearms license, also known as 'A Category' firearms license, does not cover handguns. To possess or use a handgun, the license holder must apply for additional endorsements. For a handgun, the person would typically apply for either a B or a C endorsement. 1. B endorsement: This endorsement is for pistol club members who want to own, possess or use pistols for target shooting at an approved pistol club. To obtain a B endorsement the applicant must:    a. Be a current financial member of a pistol club affiliated with the national body - Pistol New Zealand (PNZ)    b. Complete a six-month probationary period    c. Attend a minimum number of club shoots as a probationary member    d. Receive a recommendation from the approved pistol club that assesses and endorses them as a responsible and active club member 2. C endorsement: This endorsement is for firearms collection purposes, which can include handguns. A collector must prove a genuine interest in the collection of firearms, be affiliated with a collector's organization, and provide sufficient evidence of their expertise in firearms. The applicant must meet stringent requirements for firearms storage, and firearms with a C endorsement cannot be used for shooting purposes. Apart from these endorsements, there are also other special reasons for owning a handgun. Some examples include:    a. Members of theatrical groups who use firearms for props in productions    b. Individuals who require the use of firearms for pest control purposes in a professional capacity    c. Persons working for accredited firearms dealers, museums, or responsible for culling operations In conclusion, while it is possible to own a handgun in New Zealand, the process is heavily regulated and requires individuals to fulfill specific criteria and obtain appropriate endorsements. Assessments and stringent control measures ensure that New Zealand maintains its commitment to public safety while allowing responsible use of firearms within the guidelines set forth by the New Zealand Police and applicable laws."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Eleven-year-old Kevin has a vivid imagination and is fascinated by history, particularly Ancient Greece; his parents ignore his activities, having become more obsessed with buying the latest household gadgets to keep up with their neighbours.

Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the factors affecting the cat's heat generation in both terrains: Step 1: Identify the most relevant factors - In this case, the most relevant factor would be the cat's movement speed in each terrain. Step 2: Compare the cat's movement speed in both terrains - The question states that the cat \\"moves slower through the river then through the jungle.\\" Step 3: Assess the effect of movement speed on heat generation - Generally, animals (including cats) generate more heat when they move faster. This is because their muscles are working harder, which generates heat as a byproduct. Step 4: Evaluate which terrain results in lower heat generation for the cat - Given that the cat moves slower in the river, it is likely that its muscles are working less hard in the river than in the jungle. As a result, the cat would generate less heat in the river. Answer: river"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: Benjamin Franklin wrote that \\"nothing is certain but death and taxes,\\" but that is only half-true. There is absolutely nothing dead-certain about taxes this year. Unless Congress acts soon, almost all of the \\"Bush tax cuts\\" and credits that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 will expire at the end of this year. Most financial analysts and Washington insiders say they don't expect that to happen. But if it does, you -- the American taxpayer -- are in for a tax hike. A big one. Here's what it will mean to you: -- The standard percent rates -- the baseline percentage of your income that goes to the government -- will universally rise, at an estimated cost of roughly 157 billion annually; from 10 percent to 15 (for lowest-income earners), from 25 percent to 28, from 28 percent to 31, from 33 percent to 36, and from 35 percent to 39.6 percent (for highest-income earners). -- Indexing of the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which ensures that taxpayers who benefit from itemized reductions and/or credits pay a separately calculated minimum tax, will expire. -- Taxes on capital gains and dividends will increase, potentially costing investors an estimated 35 billion annually. -- Married couples who saw their standard deduction raised to that of double the single amount will go back to paying higher rates, at a cost of roughly 32 billion a year. -- Expanded tax credits like the child tax credit, which previously increased to 1,000 from 500, will expire, costing American families an estimated 26 billion a year. -- The already-expired estate tax would revert back to 2009 levels, translating to a minimum estimate of 26 billion to heirs and heiresses. -- The personal exemption phase-out (PEP), which allowed high-income filers to deduct the full value of their personal exemptions and itemized deductions, will expire, potentially costing wealthy households about 21 billion. \\"As a general matter, everybody is affected, maybe except for certain seniors,\\" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \\"All taxpayers have something at stake.\\" For the family of four bringing in a combined income of 75,000, the expiration of all Bush-era tax cuts will amount to a tax increase of 2,143 next year, according to the Tax Foundation's 2011 Income Tax Calculator. A family of four earning 150,000 would see its income tax burden increase by 4,510 to 23,150, according to the Tax Foundation. Single filers, meanwhile, would see their taxes rise by 605 at the 50,000 income plateau and by 1,355 at 75,000. A single filer earning 150,000, including 15,000 in long-term capital gains, would pay an extra 3,269, with a total tax liability of 28,340. A single parent of one child earning 25,000 would see his tax liability rise by 955, decreasing his tax refund of 1,856 to just more than 900. A low-income family of five earning a total of 45,000 would see their taxes increase by 2,538, equating to a total tax liability of 1,028. An upper-middle income family of four with two earners pulling in 150,000, including 15,000 in long-term capital gains, would see their taxes increase by 3,802. That family's total tax burden? Roughly 21,600. A high-income family of four, meanwhile, with a combined income of 300,000 and 20,000 in itemized deductions, would see their taxes jump by more than 11,000 if Congress allows all of the Bush-era tax cuts to expire. That equals a total tax liability of 68,392. For even higher earners -- such as a married couple with no children making 420,000 in total income and with 20,000 deductions apiece for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions -- that total tax liability grows to 106,815, or an increase of more than 16,600 from 2010. Further up the income ladder, a married couple earning 700,000 in wages with 300,000 worth of long-term capital gains and qualified dividends and 95,000 in deductions for mortgage interest and state/local income taxes would see their tax share grow by 61,206. Finally, a retired married couple with a combined income of 60,000 -- including 10,000 in qualified dividends, 25,000 in Social Security benefits and 10,000 in 401(k) distributions -- would see their tax liability increase by 2,676. \\"If all the tax cuts expire, everyone stands to lose,\\" said Mark Robyn, a staff economist for the Tax Foundation. \\"A lot of people like to paint the Bush tax cuts as having only benefited the rich, which is not true -- you can simply look at the estimates.\\" Citing estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, Robyn said letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire only for high-income people would raise 630 billion over 10 years, compared to 3 trillion during the same period if all the tax cuts were to expire. Robyn said one of the biggest tax cuts for middle-income earners was the creation of the 10 percent bracket, which will rise to 15 percent if Congress doesn't act. He also cited the significant impact of doubling the child tax credit to 1,000. That, too, will expire unless a compromise is reached in Washington. \\"That's a pretty significant tax cut,\\" Robyn said. \\"If that were to go back, I think a lot of people would feel that.

Step 1: Identify the key information provided in the paragraph. - Planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B. - There is the same race of intelligent creatures on both planets. Step 2: Understand the link between trees and carbon dioxide. - Trees absorb carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. - Higher amounts of trees would lead to lower amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and vice versa. Step 3: Make a logical deduction based on the provided information. - Since planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B, it is likely that planet A has fewer trees than planet B.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Paragraph: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries.

Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious.

Kumoko Answer:","output":"Title: The Web of Kumoko Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Enigma The movie opens in a small, coastal town named Havenwood. It's a quiet place known for its natural beauty and tight-knit community. Dr. James \\"Doc\\" Velie, a well-respected middle-aged veterinarian who runs the local animal clinic, is shown to be highly trusted by the townspeople, especially for his work with exotic animals. One day, when Doc Velie is having brunch with his close friends at the local cafe, he accidentally lets slip that someone named Kumoko is dead. To Doc Velie's surprise, none of his friends have heard of this person before, and they're instantly intrigued by the mysterious name. Act 2: Digging Deeper Curiosity piqued, Doc Velie's friends – Wendy, a journalist for the Havenwood Gazette; Thomas, a retired police detective; and Janet, a local historian – investigate further into Kumoko's identity. They find out that Kumoko was a reclusive marine biologist who had moved to Havenwood years ago but seldom interacted with the townspeople. Kumoko had dedicated her life to studying a unique species of spider found only in Havenwood, which is known to produce a potent venom that can be extracted for medicinal purposes. As they continue to delve into Kumoko's past, they discover Kumoko was suspected to be involved in illegal activities, specifically smuggling her spider venom research to a dangerous international group. This group was supposedly involved in creating untraceable poisons used for criminal purposes. The investigation also reveals that Kumoko had faked her own death years ago in order to escape from the criminal organization she had become entangled with. Act 3: The Truth Unveiled Things take a dramatic turn when a recent death in Havenwood is discovered to be the result of a lethal dose of the spider venom. Wendy, Thomas, and Janet suspect that Kumoko might still be alive and involved in the crime. They suspect that Doc Velie, with his knowledge of exotic animals, might also be working in secret with Kumoko. Wendy, Thomas, and Janet confront Doc Velie with their findings. Initially defensive, Doc Velie finally admits that he was aware of Kumoko's true identity, but he had only been helping Kumoko in her research to extract the antidote for the venom's deadly effects. He then reveals that Kumoko had discovered that someone in their town was the real mastermind behind the smuggling ring, and that her death had been staged so she could secretly investigate the criminal network. Act 4: A Web of Deceit Together, the friends work with Doc Velie to unravel the web of deceit spun by the smuggling ring. They eventually identify the ringleader as a high-ranking member of Havenwood's city council who had been using Kumoko's research for personal gain. In an action-packed final act, Kumoko, who had been living in hiding under a new identity, reemerges to help take down the ringleader and save Havenwood from further harm. The movie concludes with Kumoko receiving a hero's welcome from the community, Doc Velie's reputation restored, and the friends celebrating the truth finally coming to light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the SS Herring bearing all the guests nears the island, the baron briefs his zombies about the necessity of remaining calm and collected no matter what happens. Only Yetch is having trouble keeping his head (and hands) attached.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? It is really hard for me to write an honest review for this place.  I have so many partial memories, that everything kinda blurs together... but I will soldier on and try my best.  Part 1 Review: Restaurant  So if you have had a chance to eat here, it isn't too bad.  The food is a little bit salty, but when you are way wasted (which I was at the time), salt is good.  It is typical Asian fusion with your obligatory sushi rolls.  I had some grilled sea bass and a sushi roll which was decent.  Besides, ordering dinner here was a decent and quick way to get full and get into the club.  Part 2 Review: Club  As I mentioned above, I have been to Tao a lot of times.  It all kind of blends together, from raiding a bachelorette, to meeting Jesus and the Apostles hanging out with the 300 Spartans (it was one of the Halloweens I was at.... or maybe bits and pieces of two different Halloweens???), to being hungover as soon as I walked in at 11:00pm because I drank all day and then stopped for a couple hours.... you get the picture.  I have had a lot of fun fun times at Tao and it is definitely a go to place for me.  Even though it can get UBER crowded all the time, when they open up the Tao Beach area for night time (my favorite place), it is awesome.","output":"To describe the sentiment of this review, we can break it down into two parts: Restaurant review and Club review. 1. Restaurant review sentiment: The sentiment here seems to be mildly positive. The reviewer acknowledges that the food is a little salty, but they also mention that it was decent overall, especially when taking their inebriated state into consideration. 2. Club review sentiment: The sentiment of this part is generally positive, with the reviewer mentioning the numerous occasions they have visited the club and their fondness for the Tao Beach area. They do point out that it can become overcrowded, but they seem to enjoy the experiences enough to label it as a go-to place. In summary, the overall sentiment of the review is fairly positive. The reviewer seems to have had enjoyable experiences at the fusion restaurant as well as the club, while acknowledging there are some minor imperfections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective. Researcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the of more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Among the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'  The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades. \\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\\" said Bao. \\"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\\" Bao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death.  A serving size is 28 grams. Nuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart.

When a drama queen is on an emotional overdrive, practice active listening without over-involving yourself. Give them enough space to express their emotions while ensuring that you do not contribute to the escalation of the situation. Offer neutral responses to their outbursts, such as \\"I understand how you feel\\" or \\"That must be difficult,\\" without getting caught up in their drama.  In case they become excessively emotional or disruptive, it might be necessary to set boundaries. Politely but firmly express that while you understand their emotions, it is essential to maintain a certain level of calm and respect in your interactions. You can say something like, \\"I can see that you're upset, but I think it would be best if we discuss this matter once you have had some time to calm down.\\" Another effective strategy is to redirect their focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem. Drama queens often indulge in their emotional storms without considering possible options for resolution. Encourage them to take a step back and look at the situation rationally by asking questions such as, \\"What do you think would be the best way to handle this?\\" or \\"How can we find a solution to this issue together?\\"  Finally, it is crucial to remember that not all situations involving a drama queen demand your energy and attention. Sometimes, the best course of action is to simply walk away and allow them to resolve their issues on their own. In doing so, you will maintain your own emotional well-being and prevent yourself from being dragged into their whirlwind of emotions. Remember: taking care of your own mental and emotional health is just as important as helping someone else with theirs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: MATI, Greece (Reuters) - Greece’s prime minister told of the “unspeakable tragedy” the country faced after at least 74 people were killed by wildfires that swept through a resort, trapping people in cars and on the edge of cliffs as others were forced to jump off to survive.      The scale of Monday night’s devastation in Mati became apparent at first light on Tuesday.      Scores of gutted cars lined streets in the coastal town, east of Athens, melted by the intensity of the heat. Bodies lay on roadsides, and in one area, a group of 26 people were found dead - some locked in an embrace as the flames closed in.      The group, which included children, were found near the top of a cliff overlooking a beach. They had ended up there after apparently searching for an escape route.      “Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced,” the head of Greece’s Red Cross, Nikos Economopoulos, told Skai TV.      The lucky ones were able to leap off the cliffs to survive, or rush into the sea from the beach.      “We went into the sea because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water. It burned our backs and we dived into the water,” said Kostas Laganos, a middle-aged survivor.      He compared the ordeal to the destruction of the city of Pompeii, where thousands were incinerated by the volcano of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. “I said ‘my God, we must run to save ourselves and nothing else’.”      At least 74 people were killed, a fire brigade spokeswoman said, and the death toll was expected to rise. Poland said two of its citizens, a mother and her son, were among the victims.      It was not clear how many people remained unaccounted for as boats combed beaches for any remaining survivors.      Residents, their faces blackened by smoke, wandered the streets, some searching for their burned-out cars, others for their pets. The eerie silence was punctured by fire-fighting helicopters and the murmur of rescue crews. There were yellow body bags in several areas.      Many in the area had been unable to escape the fast pace of the blaze even though they were a few meters from the Aegean Sea or in their homes, the fire service said.      A Reuters photographer saw at least four dead people on a narrow road clogged with cars heading to a beach.      One of the youngest victims was believed to be a six-month-old baby who died of smoke inhalation. At least 187 people were injured, officials said, among those 23 children.      “Greece is going through an unspeakable tragedy,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said as he appeared on television to declare three days of national mourning.      “Greece is living one of its most difficult moments,” he said. “There are absolutely no words to describe how we feel right now.”      Flags atop the ancient Acropolis hill and parliament flew at half mast.      The inferno was thought to be Greece’s deadliest, with the death toll higher than fires which ravaged the southern Peloponnese peninsula over several days in August 2007, killing dozens.      By Tuesday afternoon, the Mati fire was contained, but the risk remained of it reigniting in scrubland parched by Greece’s searing summer heat.      A burned house is seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati, near Athens, Greece July 24, 2018. REUTERS/Costas Baltas      (GRAPHIC: Greece wildfires - tmsnrt.rs/2Ly4az6)      “KILLER FIRE”      Wildfires are not uncommon in Greece, and a relatively dry winter and hot summer helped create the current tinder-box conditions. The cause of the current blaze was not immediately clear and an Athens prosecutor ordered an investigation into it.      Mati is a popular spot for Greek holidaymakers, particularly pensioners and children at summer camps. One of the missing included a woman with multiple sclerosis, dragged out of her wheelchair by her frantic husband as the flames closed in, but lost in the ensuing chaos.      The fire service urged residents to report missing relatives and friends. Some took to Twitter and Facebook, posting photographs of young children and elderly couples they hoped to track down.      Greece issued an urgent appeal for help to tackle fires that raged out of control in several places across the country, destroying homes and disrupting major transport links.      Newspapers printed banner headlines including “Killer Fire” and “Hell”.      Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Croatia and Portugal offered assistance after Greece said it needed air and land assets from European Union partners.      “Our thoughts go to Greece and the victims of the terrible fires,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in tweets published in French and Greek.      Pope Francis said in a telegram he was deeply saddened by the tragedy and prayed for the victims and their families.

Flames fanned by strong winds devastated the seaside village of Mati, devouring homes and cars.      The coastguard said it and other ships rescued almost 700 people who had fled to the coast, and pulled 19 survivors and four bodies from the sea.      A local mayor told the BBC there are fears the death toll could rise to 100.      Mati is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps.      Rescuers there found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, trapped just metres from the sea.      Rafina's Mayor Evangalos Bournos told the BBC the village had \\"disappeared\\".      He said more than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed or damaged - his own home among them.      Hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance.      A fire brigade official confirmed the latest death toll.      Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of national mourning.      Image copyright EPA Image caption Smoke over a suburb of Athens      Most shocking scene I have ever witnessed      By Kostas Koukoumakas, Mati      What is happening here in eastern Attica is a black hell. After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead.      I could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere.      Most of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it.      \\"I am calling my cousin but he does not respond,\\" said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot.      I could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers.      What happened in Mati?      Fire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday.      Desperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars.      After the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said: \\"They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced.\\"      Dimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece's nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire.      The blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns.      Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches.      \\"Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water,\\" said one survivor, Kostas Laganos.      \\"It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'\\"      George Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died.      \\"We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,\\" he said.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday      Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency.      At least 150 people were injured in the area.      How are the authorities responding?      Prime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised.      A spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything.      \\"The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover,\\" she said.      Greece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires.      Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control.      Help is also needed in Sweden where at least one person has been killed and dozens injured by forest fires there as soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe.      The wildfires are the worst to hit Greece since 2007, when dozens of people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula.      What caused the fires?      Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica.      Officials quoted by AFP news agency have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes.      \\"Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,\\" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos.      Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to \\"observe and detect any suspicious activity\\".      Are you in the area? How have you been affected by the fires?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.  Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.  Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.  In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attache in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966. Did he work at any other bases ?","output":"Yes, Paul Tibbets worked at several different bases throughout his career. Some of these bases include: 1.

We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True) Problem:Passage: Flag desecration -- The flag of the United States is sometimes burned in protest of the policies of the American government, both within the country and abroad. The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipal) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as \`\`symbolic speech.'' However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. If the flag that was burned was someone else's property (as it was in the Johnson case, since Johnson had stolen the flag from a Texas bank's flagpole), the offender could be charged with petty larceny (a flag usually sells at retail for less than USD 20), or with destruction of private property, or possibly both. Question: is it illegal to desecrate the us flag Solution:","output":"0 (False) Reasoning: According to the passage, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government to prohibit the desecration of a flag. This means that it is not illegal to desecrate the US flag. However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression, and if the flag that was burned was someone else's property, the offender could be charged with petty larceny or destruction of private property."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having less oven space available can have an indirect effect on the process of producing more power by the steam engine. With less oven space, the heating process might be less efficient, potentially resulting in a slower rate of water reaching its boiling point, which subsequently leads to slower steam production. This can negatively impact the power produced by the steam engine, as less steam is generated to force the pistons up and down. In order to maintain the desired power output, additional modifications might be required, such as increasing the heat or improving the insulation of the oven to compensate for the reduced oven space."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The days are getting shorter and shorter, and temperatures are dropping. Winter is coming and it is easy for people to catch flu. Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways. Whether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate  the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \\"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills. There are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap  and water and not touching your face with your hands. People who have already had a cold can stop it from spreading by throwing away tissues  at once after using them and not shaking hands with other people.

Article: Everyone has good days and bad days. Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem   is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist   at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos   that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. \\"The best therapy   is to recognize your faults,\\" Vohs says. \\"It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on.\\" Question: The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem   _  .

The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October.

The man riding next to the pilot shoots a rifle and drops grenades hoping to kill the dog. The runs toward an American research base, Outpost 31, where a 12-man research crew is getting ready for the upcoming winter. The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men that emerge from the helicopter speak frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As he frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The pilot (named Matias in the prequel) is shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg. The camp leader Garry (Donald Moffat) shoots and kills the gibbering man in defense.Puzzled about why the Norwegians were trying to kill the dog, MacReady (Kurt Russell) the team's helicopter pilot, their doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and Norris (Charles Hallahan), go to investigate the Norwegian base.

At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the man who is killed by a whale in a book written by Melville? from the following article ?  Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process is:  A. The brain sends an electrical signal (nerve impulse) to the muscles. Explanation of steps: 1. The brain sends an electrical signal (nerve impulse) to the muscles – This is the first step as it initiates the whole process of muscle contraction by instructing the muscles to move. 2. The nerve impulse reaches the synapse (junction between nerve and muscle cell) and releases a neurotransmitter called Acetylcholine which binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane. 3. The muscle cell membrane generates an electrical signal (action potential) which travels deep into the muscle fiber through a network of T-tubules. 4. The action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a specialized organelle within the muscle cell. 5. The increased concentration of calcium ions in the cytoplasm causes the two types of proteins, actin and myosin, in the muscle filaments to interact, forming cross-bridges and sliding against each other. 6. The motion of the filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract. 7. To provide the necessary range of motion, opposing pairs of muscles (agonist and antagonist) work together – one contracts while the other relaxes to achieve coordinated body movement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split.

But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed.

Recently, a humpback whale found itself in distress, trapped by a buoy and rope attached to lobster pots. Fortunately, a dedicated team of marine conservationists and locals collaborated to free the magnificent creature and prevent further harm. This article sheds light on the rescue mission and highlights the importance of addressing marine debris that threatens both marine life and the ecosystems around us. The Rescue Mission: A team of marine conservationists, fishermen, and locals in the area quickly became aware of the humpback whale's plight when they saw it struggling against the ropes and buoy. The team quickly sprung into action. As is customary in these situations, they assessed the whale's physical condition and determined the safest approach to free it while minimizing stress and potential injury to the creature. Recognizing the sensitivity of the situation and the potential harm to both the rescuers and the whale, the team used a specialized set of tools specifically designed for whale disentanglement. These include specially adapted cutting tools to sever entangling ropes and help the animal swim away after it is freed. During the rescue operation, the team cautiously approached the whale, which was visibly agitated by the entanglement. They used their specialized tools and knowledge of the whale's anatomy to expertly cut the ropes that had become wrapped around the mammal's body. Several individuals worked in tandem to keep the animal as calm as possible and maintain a safe distance, ensuring no further damage was done to either party during the rescue. Upon freeing the whale, the team diligently monitored its condition to ensure it was able to swim away safely and without hindrance. Watching the whale regain its freedom and swim away into the ocean was a moment of relief and joy for all involved, knowing that their efforts had helped save the life of this magnificent creature. The Problem of Marine Debris: Though this rescue mission had a positive outcome, the entanglement of marine animals in fishing gear is an all-too-common problem that can have dire consequences. This scenario highlights not only the potential dangers posed by marine debris but also the importance of addressing this issue proactively. Abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear (also known as ghost gear) poses a significant threat to marine life worldwide. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, ghost gear accounts for approximately 10% of all marine debris. Marine animals such as whales, dolphins, turtles, seals, and seabirds are particularly vulnerable to entanglements, which can lead to physical injury, infection, and ultimately death due to drowning, starvation, or the inability to escape predators. In addition to entanglements, the ingestion of marine debris such as plastic bags, fishing lines, and other waste products is another significant threat to marine life. Many species confuse these items with food, and consumption can lead to harmful physical and chemical consequences, from blockages and injuries to the absorption of toxic chemicals. Conclusion: The successful rescue of the humpback whale provides a heartening example of the power of human cooperation and ingenuity in the face of adversity. The work of dedicated marine conservationists, fishermen, and locals was instrumental in saving the life of this endangered animal. However, this incident also serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by marine debris and our shared responsibility to address the issue. By investing in responsible waste disposal, proper recycling, and the reduction of plastic consumption, we can all play our part in safeguarding our oceans and their inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs.  Question: suppose less radiation absorbed by earth happens, how will it affect more radiation trapped by the atmosphere.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"When discussing the influence of the sun's radiation, it is important to consider the various factors that affect the Earth's energy balance and how these factors interact with one another. In the given scenario, we have two key processes at play: the absorption of radiation by the Earth and the trapping of some of that radiation by the atmosphere, which can lead to global warming. First, let's take a closer look at the process of radiation absorption and how it is influenced. The Earth absorbs solar radiation primarily in the form of visible and ultraviolet light, but some of this energy is also emitted back into space in the form of infrared energy. The quantity of radiation absorbed by the Earth depends on various factors such as the Earth's albedo, the angle of incidence, and atmospheric composition.  On the other hand, we must consider the second process in question: the trapping of radiation by the atmosphere. The atmosphere, primarily through the presence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, allows shortwave solar radiation to pass through towards the Earth but effectively absorbs and re-emits some of the longwave radiation back to the Earth, trapping heat in the process. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect and is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature within a habitable range for life as we know it. However, excessive greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can exacerbate the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and associated risks. Now, suppose there is less radiation absorbed by the Earth. This could come about due to various factors such as an increase in the Earth's albedo (e.g., through increased cloud cover or ice/snow coverage) or a decrease in the sun's output. A decrease in absorbed solar radiation should logically decrease the total amount of heat available for greenhouse gases to trap, resulting in a decreased greenhouse effect. So how would less radiation absorbed by the Earth affect the subsequent trapping of radiation by the atmosphere? In general, we can infer that this perturbation would lead to a reduced effect of the greenhouse phenomenon. Since there is less solar energy reaching and being absorbed by the Earth, there is a lower amount of heat available for greenhouse gases to trap and re-emit in the form of longwave radiation. This, in turn, should lead to less heat being retained by the atmosphere, which might mitigate or even offset the dangers of global warming. It is important to note that this simplified analysis does not account for all the complexities and feedback loops that exist within the Earth's climate system. In some cases, the perturbation could also result in more complex secondary effects or create conditions that further alter the initial changes in radiation absorption and atmospheric heat trapping. In conclusion, when considering the scenario of less radiation being absorbed by the Earth, the direct influence on the subsequent trapping of radiation by the atmosphere would generally be a decreased effect on the greenhouse phenomenon. However, it is important to remember that the Earth's climate system is highly complex, and numerous other factors and feedback loops might lead to more complicated outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What produces electricity by burning?\\" from the given choices is alcohols. Biofuels, which include alcohols like ethanol, are derived from biomass or living matter and can be burned effectively to produce electricity. These renewable and sustainable energy sources provide an alternative to traditional fossil fuels for electricity generation. Biofuels, such as ethanol, can be produced by processing organic materials, like corn, sugarcane, or other plants that are high in sugar or starch content. The fermentation process converts these sugars into alcohol, which can then be used as fuel. Moreover, biodiesel, another type of biofuel, can be made from oils or fats and is often used in diesel engines to reduce carbon emissions. When burned, these biofuels release energy in the form of heat, which can be converted into electricity using steam turbines or other types of generators. The process of burning biofuels to produce electricity has several advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, and providing a renewable source of energy for various applications. Although some other answer choices from the list are related to energy production or might be elements of a larger energy production process, they are not directly relevant to the main question of what produces electricity by burning. For instance, heat energy and light are both forms of energy but are not the primary source for producing electricity through combustion. Additionally, water is essential for certain energy generation processes, such as hydroelectric power or cooling systems in power plants, but it does not directly produce electricity by burning. In conclusion, the most appropriate choice given the options is alcohols, as they are biofuels that can be effectively burned to generate electricity. This renewable and sustainable form of energy offers a practical alternative to traditional fossil fuels, helping to minimize environmental impact and reduce dependency on non-renewable energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Protesters on the #OurNHS march wanted to draw attention to plans which could see hospital services in nearly two-thirds of England cut back. Union leaders say many NHS services \\"are on their knees\\". The Department of Health says it is investing an extra Â£4bn in the NHS. Organisers say that \\"at least 250,000\\" people took part in the march, which began in Tavistock Square and ended in Westminster, where speakers including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd. There is no official estimate of the numbers who took part. Mr Corbyn called for the government to provide more funding for the health service in next week's Budget. Speaking to the protesters in Parliament Square, he said: \\"The NHS is in crisis, in crisis because of the underfunding in social care and the people not getting the care and support they need. \\"It is not the fault of the staff. It is the fault of a government who have made a political choice.\\" The protest organisers say the government's proposed Sustainability Transformation Plans (STPs) across the NHS in England are a \\"smokescreen for further cuts\\" and the \\"latest instruments of privatisation\\". These proposals involve the complete closure of some hospitals and the centralising of some services such as A&E and stroke care on fewer sites. Last month the BBC revealed that hospital services in nearly two-thirds of England could be cut or scaled back. NHS England said the money saved from hospital budgets would be reinvested into community services. An NHS spokesman added that although budgets were increasing, they were not keeping pace with demand. He added: \\"NHS leaders want to redirect resources in some cases to try and make the money go further.\\" Unite leader Len McCluskey tweeted from the protest, saying: \\"I'm marching because I am furious. Tories destroying the greatest gift the people of this country have created #SaveOurNHS.\\" The union says \\"hospitals, GPs, mental health, ambulance and community services are on their knees\\". A Department of Health spokesperson said: \\"We are committed to the NHS which is why we're investing Â£10bn in its own plan for the future, including Â£4bn extra this year to transform services and improve standards of care.\\" The Conservative Party and Downing Street have been approached for comment. Deputy chairman of the British Medical Association council Dr David Wrigley said the march was \\"a cry for help for anyone who uses the NHS\\" which was \\"in such a desperate situation\\". \\"We need to highlight it. As a doctor I see day to day the serious pressures in the NHS due to the funding cuts from the government,\\" he said. Campaigner Dr Ben White tweeted: \\"#OurNHS sees you from the cradle to grave, with or without insurance. Sadly we must now fight to keep it that way.\\" They arrived by the bus load this morning; 150 coaches brought protesters from across England and Wales. They set off from Tavistock Square  - some blew whistles, some chanted, one man was dressed as a \\"therapy dog\\" for overworked NHS staff. Most are carrying \\"#OurNHS\\" placards; others said \\"Dump Trump\\", \\"No to racism\\" and \\"Migrants make our NHS\\". One of the organisers, John Rees, told me Brexit had consumed much of the \\"oxygen of debate\\" in recent months but the NHS was rising up the national agenda again. London-based nurses Sebastian Birch and Danny Goddard told me problems had mounted under Labour and Conservative governments, to the point where they now see the crisis as a \\"social welfare issue\\" not just one of healthcare funding.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse  of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution  -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules.

Japan Answer:","output":"Title: Echoes of the Rising Sun Step 1: Set the Stage: The story is set in the beautiful coastal city of Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. Our protagonist, Kenji, is a third-generation dolphin hunter, following the footsteps of his ancestors as heirs to the controversial tradition. Step 2: Introduce Conflict: Kenji's life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mesmerizing dolphin with an unusually vibrant, golden skin during one of his hunts. Something clicks within him, and he can no longer perceive his profession in the same light. Step 3: Develop Characters: Kenji's despair and guilt are intensified by his childhood sweetheart, Yumi, who has always been an avid animal rights activist fighting against the very livelihood Kenji was born into, dolphin hunting. Step 4: Deepen the Plot: His guilt compels him to secretly release the golden dolphin back into the wild. The release of the dolphin also symbolically signifies Kenji's desire to break free from the shackles of his family tradition. Kenji then joins Yumi in her fight against dolphin hunting. Step 5: Introduce Antagonist: Kenji's father, Hiroshi, also a staunch follower of tradition and the head of the hunters association, is the primary antagonist. He views his son’s shift as a betrayal and, thus, a bitter ideological clash ensues between father and son. Step 6: Climactic Moment: The climax revolves around Hiroshi capturing the golden dolphin and ordering to end its life as a part of their annual hunting event. Enraged, Kenji stages a daring raid to save the dolphin and other captured dolphins, leading to an intense showdown between father and son. Step 7: Resolution: In the end, Kenji manages to save the dolphins and lead them to safety, triggering a swell of local and international support against dolphin hunting that ultimately leads to its prohibition in Taiji. Step 8: Conclusion: The narrative concludes with Kenji transforming the town's relationship with dolphins from one of violence to one of co-existence and mutual respect, symbolized by a popular dolphin watching tour in Taiji. Thus encapsulates the cycle of breaking away from traditions that no longer serve, infused with elements of drama, emotion, and the raw beauty of human-animal bonds. In this movie plot, the focus was not just on the setting (Japan) but also on its traditional dolphin hunting practice. The resolution gives viewers food for thought on animal rights and conservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Jack Doyle. and James Slack. PUBLISHED:. 18:12 EST, 7 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 05:53 EST, 8 January 2014. Supermarkets were yesterday accused of targeting parents by selling alcohol alongside school uniforms and sweets. Campaigners said the irresponsible tactic could encourage impulse buying and ‘normalise the role of alcohol’ at home. A Home Office investigation found bottles of Smirnoff vodka, Jagermeister and other spirits on sale in Tesco next to school clothes. Warning: Photograph showing rum, whisky and vodka next to Sainsbury's sweets. A Sainsbury’s store was found selling chocolate snowmen and other sweets next to bottles of Absolut vodka and Bacardi rum. Other promotions uncovered included a WHSmith store at a motorway service station selling Strongbow cider and Carlsberg lager alongside soft drinks and food. A Lidl store stocked boxes of Christmas Jaffa Cakes next to bottles of spirits, cider and sparkling wine. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office, said: ‘The situation where some irresponsible supermarkets sell alcohol next to children’s clothes or sweets can only encourage impulse buying. This is unacceptable and needs to stop.’ He added: ‘Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking, and supermarkets have to recognise they have a significant part to play in this. ‘They need to promote and display alcohol more responsibly, do their bit to improve public awareness of the dangers of drink and support local areas in tackling alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder.’ Tom Smith, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘Retailers have got to start taking this seriously and stop selling alcohol alongside everyday products such as children’s sweets and school uniforms. Selling booze like this drives impulse buying and serves only to normalise the role of alcohol in society. ‘The reality is that we’re facing historically high levels of health problems caused by alcohol misuse. If we’re to develop a culture of more responsible drinking, retailers have to play their part.’ Supermarkets have resisted government pressure to put alcohol in aisles separate from other items. Home Office figures show 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock. They make up 13 per cent of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours. Last year David Cameron abandoned plans for a 45p minimum price for a unit of alcohol amid resistance from the drinks industry, and a proposed ban on multi-buy discounts was also ditched. But Mr Baker’s comments signal a tougher line on alcohol promotions from within government. Tesco said: ‘Alcohol should not be next to school uniforms or any other products for children in our stores.

Product review: I have been following the diet religiously for nine full days, and I have not lost a SINGLE POUND. Dr. Atkins is virtually silent on this subject: the only paragraph I could find in his book was \\"There still are those who do get a measurable ketogenic/lipoltic response and still do not lose weight....usually turn up an explanation based on medication or a hormonal problem.\\" page 230. Huh? Has anyone else had the same problem? Oh, and by the way, have you checked out the prices for products on the Atkins website? OUCH! 2.69 for a carbo-bar! Plus S&H! Here's a tip from me: Walgreen's sells ketone strips (not \\"lipolysis strips\\") for 9.99, as opposed to 12.99 plus S&H from Atkins. Please email me if you have had the same problem -NOT LOSING WEIGHT! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","output":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light, as the reviewer expresses frustration with their lack of weight loss despite following the diet strictly for nine days. The reviewer's dissatisfaction stems from the perception that Dr. Atkins does not provide enough guidance or explanation for this lack of progress and only briefly mentions potential reasons like medications or hormonal issues. Moreover, the reviewer further tarnishes the product's reputation by pointing out the high prices of Atkins products on their website, such as the 2.69 carbo-bar, as well as the additional shipping and handling fees. The reviewer then proceeds to share a money-saving tip for purchasing ketone strips from Walgreens instead of buying more expensive \\"lipolysis strips\\" from Atkins. The tone of the review is negative, and the request for others to share their experiences of not losing weight implies that this individual believes there are others facing similar issues with the product. Overall, the review paints an unflattering picture of the Atkins diet and its related products, mostly because of the perceived ineffectiveness and high prices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"In Bamar culture, nats are paid tribute through a combination of Buddhist practices and nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats. This form of worship is deeply rooted in the cultural and religious practices of the Bamar people in Myanmar, who have been influenced by the neighboring countries' cultures, such as Thailand, India, and the Mon people. Nat worship plays an essential role in Bamar culture, incorporating local beliefs and customs into a unique form of spiritual practice. Nats are considered spirits or deities that can have both positive and negative influences on people's lives. To ensure harmony and success in their daily activities, the Bamar people pay tribute to these nats through various rituals and ceremonies. One of the main ways the Bamar people pay tribute to nats is by erecting nat shrines or altars in their homes or public spaces. These shrines usually contain statues or images of the nats, accompanied by offerings such as flowers, fruits, and other food items. Incense is often burned as a form of offering, and people may light candles or oil lamps to show respect and devotion to the nats. In addition to these individual acts of worship, the Bamar people also participate in communal nat festivals, marked by lively music, dance, and theatre performances. These events often involve the reenactment of historical or mythical tales connected to the nat pantheon, highlighting the cultural significance of nat worship and its integration with Buddhism and local folklore. During these festivals, nat mediums, known as \\"nat kadaw,\\" play a crucial role in channelling the nats and serving as intermediaries between the human and spiritual worlds. Nat kadaw are usually dressed in elaborate costumes and makeup, performing traditional dances and songs that are believed to invoke the presence of the nats. They may also provide guidance and advice to the community members, addressing their concerns and offering solutions to problems attributed to the nats' influences. In conclusion, the Bamar people pay tribute to nats through a variety of elaborate rituals and ceremonies that combine Buddhist practices with the local customs and beliefs surrounding nat worship. These practices include the creation of nat shrines, offerings, and communal festivals featuring music, dance, and theatre, highlighting the deep connection between spirituality and culture in the Bamar society of Myanmar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Crystal cat litter is made of silica gel. This material is extremely absorptive and will do an excellent job of pulling residual moisture out of a water-damaged phone. You can purchase crystal cat litter at any large grocery store or pet-supply shop. Do not use any other type of cat litter. Clay-based or powdery litters may stick to your phone and turn it into a wet, clay-covered mess. Instant oatmeal is more absorptive than regular rolled oats and more much absorptive than steel-cut oats. If you already have instant oatmeal in your home cabinet, it may be the most effective substance you can use to dry your phone. Be aware that if you use oatmeal to dry your phone components, you may end up with a phone covered in small, gooey bits of oatmeal dust. You can purchase unflavored instant oatmeal at your local grocery store. Synthetic desiccant packets are those 3⁄4 in (1.9 cm) packets that come in various commercial items including shoe boxes, dried foods (like beef jerky or spices), and electronic devices. The packets are typically filled with highly absorptive silica beads which will pull moisture out of your phone. You do not need to tear open the packets. Simply pile them up on top of your phone and let them pull the moisture out.  This option will only work if you’ve been saving up silica gel packets in advance for several months. However, this isn’t a bad idea: many people own smartphones, and the chances of dropping your smartphone in water at some point are high. Or, if you haven’t been saving up silica gel packets, you can order them in bulk through major online retailers. Couscous is a type of crushed and dried wheat grain. The small, dry grains will work similarly to silica beads or instant oatmeal and pull any residual moisture out of your phone components. You can purchase couscous pearls at any grocery store or supermarket. The pearls shouldn’t get any couscous dust on your phone’s components, making this a cleaner option than instant oats. Be sure to purchase an unflavored and unseasoned variety.

Read this and answer the question The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Why are Avian hearts larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass?","output":"Avian hearts are larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass because this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Birds require a greater amount of oxygen and energy to sustain flight, and having a larger heart relative to body mass helps them achieve this by efficiently circulating oxygenated blood throughout their bodies."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Movie title: The Passion of the Christ Context: The film opens in Gethsemane during the night as Jesus Christ (Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John (James' brother) sleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests.

The usage of the word \\"sorry\\" suggests that the reviewer feels apologetic for not providing a positive review, but maintains their negative stance on the album. The title also reinforces the negative sentiment – \\"Disappointing release, had hoped for better\\" explicitly states that the reviewer had higher expectations for the album and ultimately found it disappointing. Although the reviewer mentions that they have enjoyed Sister Hazel's music for years, the overall tone of the review leans towards dissatisfaction with this specific release. In conclusion, the product review primarily displays a negative sentiment towards Drew's album, as the reviewer expresses disappointment in its content and perceived lack of originality. The mention of a past positive relationship with the artist's music does little to relieve the negative sentiments expressed throughout the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hand Signals Though indicators  are used for the purpose of showing which direction you are going, knowing some hand signals is very important and are usually always asked in a driving test. When you want to turn right, you can put your left hand out of the window and point upward. When you want to make a left turn, you can reach your left arm out of the window and point to the left. If you want to slow down or stop, you can just point downward. School Buses Yellow school buses have flashing red lights and stop signs that reach out from the driver's side. The drivers use these warning signals when letting pupils on and off. No matter which side of the road you are traveling on, if you come upon a school bus with its lights flashing and a stop sign used, you must stop. It's the law.

Mikhail Baryshnikov, a renowned dancer, choreographer, and actor, is a figure of great significance in the world of performing arts. Born in the Latvian SSR of the Soviet Union in 1948, Baryshnikov's extraordinary talent soon found him international recognition. Throughout his performing career, he has made significant contributions to the realms of ballet and dance, both in the Soviet Union and in America, where he eventually defected during a tour in Toronto, Canada in 1974. This nickname, \\"Misha\\", would have most likely been used by his family, close friends, colleagues, and possibly his fans, highlighting a sense of familiarity and fondness. It is common in Russian culture to use diminutives as terms of endearment, and in this case, signals a sort of affectionate respect towards a beloved figure in the field of performing arts. Therefore, stating \\"Mikhail Baryshnikov was called Misha\\" is perfectly accurate and follows the given text. It summarizes a key piece of personal information about Baryshnikov, that is, his commonly-used nickname, giving further insight into his persona, both personal and professional. This information not only brings us closer to understanding Baryshnikov as an artist and an individual but also provides cultural context about naming practices in Russian-speaking societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Question: how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in Answer:","output":"Using an egg substitute in a cake recipe can affect various aspects of the final product, including texture, taste, and appearance, depending on the type of substitute used. The key role of eggs in most cake recipes is to provide structure, tenderness, moistness, leavening, and other functionalities through proteins, fats, and water. 1. Texture: Eggs contribute to the structure and stability of a cake by forming a network of proteins when they coagulate during baking. Egg substitutes may not be able to replicate this effect entirely, which can lead to a less stable or denser cake compared to one made with regular eggs. 2. Taste: Eggs provide flavor to the cake, which may be difficult to replicate when using an egg substitute. However, many egg substitutes, such as applesauce or mashed bananas, can bring their unique, pleasant flavor to the cake, which could enhance or alter the overall taste. 3. Appearance: Some egg substitutes, like flaxseed or chia seed gel, can make the cake slightly darker due to their color, while other substitutes may not have any significant impact on the cake's appearance. Eggs also contribute to the browning of the cake surface, and some substitutes might not provide the same level of browning. 4. Leavening: Eggs contain proteins that help leaven the cake and create a tender, light texture. Many commercial egg substitutes are designed to provide similar leavening effects, but others, like mashed fruits, might not offer the same lift. 5. Moistness: Depending on the egg substitute used, the moistness of the cake can differ. Some egg substitutes, like applesauce, mashed bananas, or yogurt, can add moisture to the cake, while others may result in a drier texture. It is essential to consider the specific recipe and type of cake being made when choosing an egg substitute. Some egg substitutes work better in specific recipes, while others might not yield the desired results. For best results, use egg substitutes that have been tested and recommended for cake recipes or experiment with different substitutes to find the perfect match for your requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.

He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious. However, when he spits it out in disgust, Terrori realizes that Pepito's dislike of drinking blood, the fact that he was harmed by a lead bullet earlier (vampires can only be harmed by silver bullets) and that he is completely impervious to sunlight (it instantly kills vampires) means that Pepito has stopped being a vampire. Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans.

Question: Who congratulates Joker on his kill? Movie title: Full Metal Jacket Movie plot: In 1967, during the Vietnam War, a group of new U.S. Marine Corps recruits arrive at Parris Island, South Carolina, for basic training. After having their heads shaved, they meet Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who employs excessively forceful methods to turn the recruits into hardened, combat-ready Marines. Among the recruits are privates \\"Joker\\", \\"Cowboy\\", and the overweight, bumbling Leonard Lawrence, who earns the nickname \\"Gomer Pyle\\" after attracting Hartman's wrath. Unresponsive to Hartman's discipline, Pyle is eventually paired with Joker. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing the recruits have failed to improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment for the rest of the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation for Pyle's failures, the platoon hazes him with a blanket party, restraining him in his bunk while beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as him talking to his M14 rifle. Following their graduation, the recruits receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments; Joker is assigned to Basic Military Journalism, while most of the others (including Cowboy and Pyle) are assigned to Infantry. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom, loading his rifle with live ammunition. Joker attempts to calm Pyle, who executes drill commands and recites the Rifleman's Creed. The noise awakens the platoon, and Hartman confronts Pyle, ordering him to surrender the rifle. Pyle shoots Hartman dead, and then kills himself.

It's a West Slavic language spoken mainly in the Czech Republic, and by Czech people in surrounding countries like Slovakia, Austria, and Germany, or around the world. Czech is a member of the Slavic language group, which also includes languages such as Polish, Russian, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and several others. Czech is one of the official languages of the European Union. The language consists of many dialects, which are all slightly different depending on the region of the Czech Republic where they are spoken: Central Bohemian, Moravian, Silesian, Cieszyn, and others.

Output:","output":"Let's denote the price of the first, second, and third varieties of tea as P1, P2, and P3, respectively. We are given that P1 = 126, P2 = 135, and the prices are mixed in the ratio 1:1:2. Let's use 'x' as the common ratio factor amount of each tea variety. Then the amounts of each variety can be represented as follows: - First variety: x kg (126 Rs/kg) - Second variety: x kg (135 Rs/kg) - Third variety: 2x kg (P3 Rs/kg) The total price of the mixture is worth 153 Rs/kg. Let's denote the total weight of the mixture as W and its total value as V. We know that W = x + x + 2x = 4x V = (126 * x) + (135 * x) + (P3 * 2x) Now, since the mixture is worth 153 Rs/kg, we can write the following equation: Value of mixture / Weight of mixture = Mixture price per kg V / W = 153 Substituting the values of V and W in terms of x and P3: ((126 * x) + (135 * x) + (P3 * 2x)) / (4x) = 153 Simplifying the equation, we get: (261 * x + P3 * 2x) / 4x = 153 Now, multiply both sides by 4x to eliminate the denominator: 261 * x + P3 * 2x = 153 * 4x 261 * x + P3 * 2x = 612 * x Now, isolate P3 on one side of the equation: P3 * 2x = 612 * x - 261 * x P3 * 2x = 351 * x Now, divide both sides by 2x to find the value of P3: P3 = (351 * x) / (2 * x) Cancel 'x' from both sides P3 = 351 / 2 P3 = 175.5 So, the price of the third variety of tea per kg is 175.5 Rs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi.  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm.

Don’t pick at or squeeze your blemishes. Use water-based cosmetics rather than ones made with oil. Bathe as soon as you can after doing physically-demanding tasks.","output":"Title: Protecting Your Skin: A Comprehensive Guide to Maintaining a Clear Complexion Introduction Most people endeavour to achieve a healthy, glowing complexion that not only enhances their appearance but also boosts their confidence. However, in this fast-paced world, many individuals overlook the importance of maintaining a simple and effective skincare routine. This article highlights the importance of washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser, avoiding touching your face unnecessarily, refraining from picking or squeezing blemishes, using water-based cosmetics, and promptly bathing after strenuous activities for a radiant and clear complexion. Washing Your Face Twice Daily with a Gentle Cleanser The first step in maintaining healthy skin is cleansing your face twice a day, ideally once in the morning and once before bed. This key skincare habit removes dirt, oil, bacteria, and dead skin cells that may accumulate on the skin's surface throughout the day. Gentle, pH-balanced cleansers help protect the skin's natural barrier, which is crucial in maintaining skin health and preventing breakouts. Using a harsh or overly abrasive cleanser can cause irritation, redness, and even dryness, leading to a compromised skin barrier and more frequent breakouts. Avoid Touching Your Face Throughout the day, our hands come into contact with different surfaces and objects, accumulating various types of bacteria, viruses, and dirt. When we touch our faces, these contaminants can quickly find their way into our pores, leading to irritation and breakouts. Minimizing the frequency of face touching can help reduce the spread of bacteria and ultimately lower the risk of acne and other skin issues. Make an effort to become consciously aware of this habit and practice good hand hygiene to maintain clean skin. Refraining from Picking or Squeezing Blemishes Picking or squeezing a pimple or blackhead may seem like a fast solution to eliminating blemishes, but it can actually do more harm than good by causing inflammation and scarring. When you break the skin during this process, bacteria can easily enter, increasing the risk of infection and worsening the blemish. Additionally, the pressure applied to the surrounding skin can result in the rupturing of the follicle wall, spreading the infection and causing more breakouts. To safely and effectively treat blemishes, opt for spot treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide instead. Using Water-Based Cosmetics Makeup can provide a boost in self-confidence and allow for creative self-expression, but not all cosmetics are created equal. Oil-based products can clog pores and exacerbate acne-prone skin, resulting in more frequent breakouts. By choosing water-based and non-comedogenic makeup products, you're ensuring your cosmetics are less likely to clog pores and cause irritation. In addition to selecting the right products, it's essential to thoroughly cleanse your face of makeup before bedtime to prevent overnight buildup and breakouts. Bathing after Physically-Demanding Activities Sweating is a natural and necessary bodily function that helps regulate body temperature. However, when sweat and dirt are left on the skin for prolonged periods, they can clog pores and lead to breakouts. To avoid this, make it a priority to shower or bathe as soon as possible after engaging in physically demanding activities or sports. Use a gentle body wash and focus on cleansing areas that are prone to acne, such as the back, chest, and shoulders. Remember to change out of sweaty clothes and avoid prolonged contact with dirty exercise equipment to minimize the risk of skin irritation and acne. Conclusion Incorporating these skincare practices into your daily routine will not only help you maintain a clear and glowing complexion but also contribute to overall skin health. Cleansing your face twice a day, avoiding face touching, refraining from picking or squeezing blemishes, using water-based cosmetics, and bathing after physically demanding tasks are crucial steps to put the best face forward.

Write a summary based on this article: A new theory has emerged: that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the slaughtering of mammoths at sites which may have suited early man to ambush the creatures. Picture: the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, The Siberian Times      The cemeteries of bones have long puzzled scientists because they appear to show the giant shaggy relatives of today's elephants all died in the same place. The bones are different ages, spanning centuries, and recent evidence suggests that spear-hurling humans played a role in hunting these iconic animals.      Now a new theory has emerged: that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the slaughtering of mammoths at sites which may have suited early man to ambush the creatures.      Professor Emerita Pat Shipman of Penn State University was intrigued by evidence from Predmosti, in the Czech republic, where a large fragment of bone was placed in a dog's mouth shortly after burial - some 27,000 years ago.      She speculates that the animal was accorded special treatment for its hunting prowess.      Evidence from Predmosti, in the Czech republic - a large fragment of bone was placed in a dog's mouth shortly after burial - some 27,000 years ago. Picture: Mietje Germonpre.      She analysed archeological sites in Siberia and Europe where large numbers of mammoth bones were used in the construction of dwellings by ancient man.      'They're crazy sites,' said anthropologist Shipman in Science journal. 'The sheer number of dead mammoths is astounding.'      In Berelekh - in the north of Siberia's Sakha Republic - are more than 160 of the tusked goliaths.      'One of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time,' she said.      Theories on such 'mammoth megasites' have included floods washing bones to a certain spot or herds that fell through thin ice. But they seem to date to 44,000 years ago, around the time modern humans emerged.      She found that 'few of the mortality patterns from these mammoth deaths matched either those from natural deaths among modern elephants killed by droughts or by culling operations with modern weapons that kill entire family herds of modern elephants at once'.      The professor concluded in her research, outlined in Quaternary International, that the mammoths were killed in the same spot for many generations. 'There's something that's drawing them to that location,' she said.      She believes the sites may have been on migration routes in spots where early humans and their domesticated dogs could attack.      In Berelekh - in the north of Siberia's Sakha Republic - are more than 160 of the tusked goliaths. Picture: P. Lazarev, The Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk      Skulls suggesting early dogs have been found at some of the mammoth graveyard sites, say reports.      'Many of the skulls bear healed fractures, a possible indication that these animals were cared for by humans,' reports Science. Shipman speculates that the mammoth megasites may be the first significant evidence of a cooperative relationship between man and dog.      'The canines could have corralled the mammoths at the ambush sites and held the prey in place while human hunters moved in for the kill, Shipman says. 'Once the mammoths were dead, the dogs could have protected the sites from scavengers.'      She said: 'Dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often, and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in. Both of these effects would increase hunting success.'      And 'all of that mammoth meat would have brought predators from miles around.'      'In return, the humans may have provided these canines with food and protection. And slowly, a closer relationship may have begun to form,' stated Science. 'Dogs may indeed be man's best friend,' she said.      Skulls suggesting early dogs have been found at some of the mammoth graveyard sites, say reports. Picture: Jeffrey Mathison      Now a search will begin for more evidence of dogs which might support her hypothesis. Some authorities are sceptical, at least until seeing more evidence.      'I like it as an idea, but there's no smoking gun,' said one expert, Nicholas Conard, who works at the University of Tubingen in Germany. ||||| It’s known as the mammoth cemetery for good reason. Along the banks of a Siberian river not far from the Arctic Ocean lie thousands of bones, most of them belonging to the giant, shaggy relatives of today’s elephants. A new study argues that such mysterious graveyards were not the results of a natural catastrophe, but rather the work of early human hunters—who may have had help from some of the world’s first dogs.      “This is the first time that someone’s gone out on a limb and suggested something different than what we thought before,” says Angela Perri, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and an expert on dog domestication. “But it’s still very speculative at this stage.”      Study author Pat Shipman first became interested in what she calls “mammoth megasites” in 2009. About 30 such spots have been unearthed in central Europe and North Asia, some with tens of thousands of bones packed tightly on top of each other across areas as small as 60 square meters. The massive tusks and femurs of mammoths jut out among the remains of wild horses, deer, foxes, and other animals. “They’re crazy sites,” says Shipman, an anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park. “The sheer number of dead mammoths is astounding.” More than 160 of the tusked goliaths lie in the mammoth cemetery—a site known as Berelekh—alone.      How did they get there? Some scientists think it was an act of nature—perhaps a flood that swept dozens of animals to a particular spot, or an unlucky herd that fell through thin ice. But recent evidence has suggested that people may to be blame. Shipman says the mammoth megasites begin to appear about 44,000 years ago, just about the time that modern humans entered this part of the world. What’s more, archaeologists have found evidence of huts made of mammoth bones at some of these locations, as well as cuts and burn marks on the bones that could only have been made by people.      To get a clearer picture, Shipman combed through the literature on more than a dozen mammoth megasites, paying particular attention to the age and sex of the mammoths unearthed there. She then compared these demographics with those seen with the deaths of large numbers of elephants, the mammoth’s closest living relative. Natural disasters such as droughts kill the youngest and oldest elephants, but other sudden die-offs—such as a herd falling through ice or a cull of elephants to control their population—kill indiscriminately, leaving behind the carcasses of young and old, male and female. Elephant hunters, meanwhile, tend to kill each animal in a different place. “To my surprise, hardly anything matched these patterns,” Shipman says of the mammoth bones. What’s more, the dating on the bones indicated that they had been laid down over hundreds of years. That suggests that the animals were killed over and over in the same spot over many generations, she reports in Quaternary International. “There’s something that’s drawing them to that location.”      Shipman says the data point to a scenario in which humans killed the mammoths, but not in the way people do today. Instead of culling them or hunting them across vast plains, ancient peoples may have ambushed the creatures. The reason so many bones are found in the same location may be that these spots were ideal for such ambushes. Perhaps they were surrounded by thick brush, in which spear-hurling humans could hide, or maybe they lay along a commonly traveled migration route. Shipman also thinks the hunters may have had some help from dogs.      It’s still unclear exactly when or where dogs became domesticated, but some recent archaeological evidence suggests it may have happened around the same time and place as the mammoth megasites. A skull recovered from a cave in southern Belgium, for example, has both wolf- and doglike features, and it dates to about 32,000 years ago. Though genetic evidence indicates that this animal may not have been an ancestor of today’s dogs, the find suggests that the process of canine domestication could have begun tens of thousands of years ago. Significantly, Shipman says, similar skulls have been found among the mammoth bones at several megasites. Many of the skulls bear healed fractures, a possible indication that these animals were cared for by humans.      Shipman speculates that the mammoth megasites may be the first significant evidence of a cooperative relationship between man and dog. The canines could have corralled the mammoths at the ambush sites and held the prey in place while human hunters moved in for the kill, Shipman says. Once the mammoths were dead, the dogs could have protected the sites from scavengers. “All of that mammoth meat would have brought predators from miles around,” she says. In return, the humans may have provided these canines with food and protection. And slowly, a closer relationship may have begun to form.      Finding more large and strong doglike animals at these sites would support her hypothesis, Shipman says. Such finds will be necessary to convince archaeologists like Nicholas Conard that the new work is more than just a leap of faith. “I like it as an idea, but there’s no smoking gun,” says Conard, who works at the University of Tübingen in Germany and who has personally excavated mammoth megasites. Perri agrees. “We don’t know enough about what early dogs—or even the wolves of the time—looked like,” she says. “This is extrapolating from too few examples.” Still, Conard says, “there are so few ideas about how these sites formed, and what Shipman is arguing is possible and testable. It’s a move in the right direction.” |||||","output":"A new theory suggests that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the hunting of mammoths at sites which may have been suitable for early man to ambush the creatures.

Information:  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.  - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek.  - Mnemosyne (or  ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:  - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / (  ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory .  - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610  c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.  - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.   - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.    What is the relationship between 'mneme' and 'zeus'?","output":"The relationship between Mneme and Zeus lies within the realm of Greek mythology, which is an essential part of the ancient Greek religious and cultural beliefs. Mneme and Zeus are both mythological figures that play distinctive roles in the Greek pantheon. Mneme, one of the three original Boeotian Muses, is known as the Muse of memory. She, along with her sisters Melete and Aoide, preceded the later establishment of the Nine Olympian Muses. Muses were considered to be the personifications of knowledge and the arts, and they inspired human creativity, wisdom, and intellect. As the Muse of memory, Mneme represented the importance of remembering and preserving essential elements from the past. On the other hand, Zeus was the supreme deity in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods on Mount Olympus. He was the god of the sky and thunder and held the ultimate authority over both gods and humans. Zeus was considered to be the most powerful among all gods and played a significant role as the central figure of the Greek pantheon. The relationship between Mneme and Zeus can be found in their roles as parent and child in Greek mythology. Mnemosyne, the Titaness, and the personification of memory, is the mother of the Nine Muses, one of whom is Mneme. Zeus, as the father of the Nine Muses, plays the role of Mneme's father. It is through the union of Zeus and Mnemosyne that the Nine Muses, including Mneme, were born. The offspring of this union bridges the gap between the Titans and the Olympian gods, representing aspects of both divine lineages. This connection between Mneme and Zeus also points to a deeper symbolism within Greek mythology: the convergence of power (Zeus) and memory (Mneme). By fathering Mneme, Zeus shows his influence not only in the realm of gods but also in human knowledge and wisdom. Memory, as represented by Mneme, is crucial in the preservation of history, knowledge, and culture, which in turn reflects the ideals and values that the ancient Greeks held in the highest regard. Zeus, as the divine embodiment of power and authority, combines with memory to create a lasting impact on humanity's artistic and intellectual development. In summary, the relationship between Mneme and Zeus in Greek mythology can be defined by their roles as daughter and father, as well as the symbolic union of memory and power. This relationship highlights the significance of both divine figures in the Greek pantheon and their influence on human wisdom and cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several reasons for this: 1. Timeframe: The statement talks about \\"the last centuries of philosophy,\\" whereas the question specifically asks for philosophers of the last 100 years. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and David Hume (1711-1776) are not from the past 100 years. Antony Flew (1923-2010), on the other hand, fits the time frame but is still not a suitable example for other reasons, as mentioned below. 2. Context: The statement mentions that the respective philosophers raised questions regarding the arguments for God's existence, which implies that they were critically examining, and perhaps even challenging, these arguments. This context does not necessarily mean that they were arguing for the existence of God themselves. 3. Antony Flew's stance: Antony Flew was a well-known atheist philosopher known for his arguments against the existence of God. However, late in his life, he changed his position and started leaning towards deism, which is the belief in a non-interventionist creator based on reason instead of revelation or religious authority. This change of view doesn't necessarily mean that he was arguing for the existence of God in the traditional sense, like the question implies. In contrast, here are three philosophers from the last 100 years known for defending the existence of God: 1. Alvin Plantinga (1932-present): Plantinga is an American philosopher known for his work in the philosophy of religion. He formulated the \\"Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism\\" and the \\"Free Will Defense,\\" arguing that belief in God can be rational even without empirical evidence. Plantinga's work in defending theism has been influential in contemporary philosophy. 2. Richard Swinburne (1934-present): Swinburne is a British philosopher who has defended the existence of God using various arguments from natural theology, which include the teleological argument, the cosmological argument, and the argument from consciousness. He has written numerous books on the philosophy of religion, including \\"The Existence of God\\" and \\"The Coherence of Theism.\\" 3. William Lane Craig (1949-present): Craig is an American philosopher and theologian known for his work on the cosmological argument, specifically the Kalam Cosmological Argument, which posits that the universe must have had a cause for its existence. He has participated in numerous debates with atheists and skeptics, presenting several arguments in favor of theism. These philosophers are more appropriate examples for answering the question at hand, as they are from the last 100 years and have presented or defended arguments supporting the existence of God."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question. There are five possible categories (1) algebra (2) arithmetic (3) measurement (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category. Problem:Let p = 54 + -49. Solve -13 - 12 = -p*h for h. Solution:","output":"Step 1: Identify the category of the question The problem contains letter variables (p and h) and asks to find the value of a variable (h). So, this problem belongs to category (1) 'algebra'. Step 2: Simplify the given equations We are given the equation p = 54 + -49, which can be simplified as p = 54 - 49. So, p = 5. Step 3: Use the value of 'p' to find 'h' We are given the equation -13 - 12 = -p*h, which can be simplified as -25 = -5*h. We need to solve this equation for h. Step 4: Solve for 'h' To solve the equation -25 = -5*h, we will first divide both sides of the equation by -5: -25 / -5 = (-5*h) / -5 So, 5 = h Step 5: Conclusion The variable h has a value of 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He wished he hadn't come to the lake for the weekend. \\"We're ready,\\" Dad said as he came in from the porch. \\" Grab your rod.\\"  Alex turned away from the window and slowly picked up his fishing rod. \\"Have fun!\\" Mom said. \\"Sure,\\" said Alex, trying to make his voice bright. \\"We should have done this before.\\" Dad said. \\"Let's catch a big one!\\" Dad picked up his tackle   box, rod, and bait can from the porch. He clicked on the flashlight.     They walked down the hill toward the lake in the narrow beam of light. The only thing Alex could see was the circle of weeds and rocks at their feet, lit by the flashlight. Insect voices filled his ears---clicks, hums, buzzes, whines. Hundreds of bugs waited in the darkness to attack. \\"Ow!\\" he blurted as he felt a sting on his arm. \\"Mosquitoes,\\" Dad said. \\"I have brought some spray   to keep them off.\\"  When they reached the boat, Alex stumbled as he climbed over the side. \\"I don't like this much,\\" he said. \\"It's so dark.\\" Dad squeezed his shoulder. \\"Don't worry.

Ask a question about Sexual orientation.","output":"What are the different types of sexual orientation, and how can one understand and respect the diversity among them? Sexual orientation is a term used to describe a person's consistent pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, or neither gender. It is a spectrum, with a range of orientations that people can identify with, and a fundamental aspect of an individual's identity. Understanding and respecting the diverse range of sexual orientations can foster a more open-minded, empathetic, and inclusive society. This detailed answer provides an overview of some common sexual orientation categories and offers guidance on fostering understanding and respect for this diversity. 1. Heterosexuality: This is the most common sexual orientation, referring to individuals who are attracted to members of the opposite sex. For example, a heterosexual man would be attracted to women, while a heterosexual woman would be attracted to men. 2. Homosexuality: This refers to people who are attracted to members of the same sex. Gay men are sexually and/or romantically attracted to other men, while lesbians are women who are attracted to other women. It is essential to respect and accept homosexuality as a legitimate and valid sexual orientation, just like heterosexuality. 3. Bisexuality: This is a sexual orientation characterized by attraction to both men and women. It does not necessarily mean that the attraction is equal or that a bisexual person is sexually involved with both genders simultaneously. Like any other orientation, bisexuality is a valid expression of human sexuality. 4. Pansexuality: Pansexual individuals have the capacity for attraction to others, regardless of their gender identity or biological sex. They may be attracted to people who identify as male, female, transgender, genderqueer, or other gender non-conforming identities. This term is more inclusive than bisexuality, as it acknowledges the diverse range of gender identities that exist beyond the gender binary. 5. Asexuality: Asexual people experience little to no sexual attraction to others. This does not mean that they are incapable of forming deep emotional bonds or engaging in intimate relationships; rather, their attraction to others is not based on a desire for sexual interaction. It is crucial to understand and acknowledge the existence of asexuality as a valid sexual orientation. To foster understanding and respect for sexual orientation diversity, here are some helpful tips: 1. Educate yourself: Educating oneself about different sexual orientations is key to forming respectful and empathetic perspectives. Engage in conversations with people of diverse sexual orientations, read relevant literature, and participate in seminars or workshops. 2. Use inclusive language: When communicating with others, be mindful of your language and terminology. Avoid assumptions based on appearances and treat people as individuals with their unique preferences. 3. Challenge stereotypes: Recognize and confront the stereotypes and misconceptions that can reinforce prejudice and discrimination. Support the people in your life who may be facing discrimination due to their sexual orientation. 4. Be a listener: When discussing sexual orientation, it is vital to be an active, empathetic listener. If you are unsure about the correct language or terminology to use, it's better to ask questions and seek clarification rather than making assumptions. 5. Advocate for policies and practices supporting inclusivity: Encourage and support organizations, businesses, and institutions to adopt policies and practices that respect and celebrate the diversity of sexual orientations. By understanding, respecting, and celebrating the various sexual orientations that exist, we can come together to create a more tolerant and inclusive society, where everyone is free to express their true selves without fear of judgment or discrimination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \\"activity\\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics  , strength building, and flexibility   exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day. On days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day. Just as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching   activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes.

Blogger Danny Sloggett won support on social media after he called for the so-called \\"ghost signs\\" to be saved. A JCDecaux spokewoman said its billboard had been \\"permanently removed\\" and would not be replaced. But she was unable to confirm why the company had taken the decision. Mr Sloggett described the move as \\"wonderful\\" and said he felt his efforts had been appreciated. \\"I think it's great that they might have taken notice of what we were saying. So many things have been ruined and it's good to rectify something from our past,\\" he said. When Mr Sloggett first spotted the billboards, he described them as \\"relics\\" which \\"showed off Clacton's power\\". \\"The Royal Family used to come here in the 1920s and 30s. Lots of people used to come from London, and things like this are an important part of our history which has been hidden away,\\" he said. The posters, which advertised Ambrosia, Black Cat cigarettes and a local cafe, are on the side of a building currently leased by an estate agency. The BBC was unable to contact the owner of the building with the vintage posters on its side. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Vintage signs from the 1920s were discovered in Clacton when a JCDecaux billboard was removed.

Input: “For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said of his decision not to seek reelection in 2018. | AP Photo Chaffetz won't run for reelection in 2018 'I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector.'      House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Wednesday he will not run for reelection next year, ending a fast-rising political career, at least for now.      “After long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018,” he wrote on Facebook. “I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector.”      Story Continued Below      The move by the highly ambitious politician came as a shock to many in Washington. Chaffetz defeated a more moderate GOP incumbent in a 2008 primary and rose to prominence as a fierce inquisitor of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He also was seen as a possible candidate for the Senate.      “I have long advocated public service should be for a limited time and not a lifetime or full career,” he wrote. “After more than 1,500 nights away from my home, it is time. I may run again for public office, but not in 2018.”      Asked whether he would run for governor in 2020 in an interview with Utah’s KSL Newsradio, Chaffetz said, “Maybe,” adding, “I’m not trying to close the door or open the door to anything in the future… a couple years from now you can make that decision.”      Chaffetz also pre-emptively dismissed speculation about why he would leave Congress.      “For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives,” he wrote. “I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker [Paul] Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.”      In the radio interview, he encouraged listeners that hear any rumors about him to \\"put that aside.\\"      \\"I love serving in Congress, but I love my family more,\\" Chaffetz said. \\"I didn't want to go there forever, I really meant it when I said I wanted to get in, serve, and get out.\\"      He added that the contentious political environment had nothing to do with his decision to leave Capitol Hill, and he touted his work on the powerful Oversight Committee, including his controversial investigations of the Benghazi attacks, Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the IRS.      Democrats responded to Chaffetz's announcement by accusing him of failing to investigate the Trump administration's improprieties.      \\"Chaffetz refused to hold Trump and his family accountable for using the presidency to pad their bank accounts at the expense of Americans,\\" said DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson. She said DNC Chairman Tom Perez and Sen. Bernie Sanders are heading to Salt Lake City on Friday to campaign against Trump.      Chaffetz's 3rd District in Utah, which runs from the Salt Lake City suburbs to the state's southern and eastern borders, is one of the most Republican in the country: Neither Obama nor Clinton scored even a quarter of the vote there in 2012 or 2016, and Chaffetz has won reelection with at least 70 percent of the vote four times in a row.

You can unsubscribe at any time.      The district has not been open for two decades and could draw a large crowd of interested Republican office-seekers as a result.      A Democratic physician, Kathryn Allen, raised a whopping 561,000 in the first quarter to run against Chaffetz, but she will face that built-in partisan disadvantage in a general election.      Aidan Quigley and Scott Bland contributed to this report. ||||| On Capitol Hill, Mr. Chaffetz has shown an opportunistic streak, often rushing toward television cameras with an eager smile. During the election, he vacillated several times before backing President Trump. He said he would not be able to look his teenage daughter in the eye should he vote for Mr. Trump after revelations arose that Mr. Trump had boasted in 2005 of sexually assaulting women. Then he voted for him. And he vowed to investigate Hillary Clinton whether she won or not.      With a ready foil in Mrs. Clinton, whose brushes with controversy have sustained many Republican congressional careers, Mr. Chaffetz appeared primed to emerge as a chief tormentor for a new Democratic White House.      Instead, as much as perhaps any member of Congress, his fortunes turned with Mr. Trump’s victory.      During his time heading the committee, Mr. Chaffetz has focused often on two pet issues: criticizing the Secret Service for security lapses and holding Mrs. Clinton to account.      After the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, announced in July that the bureau would recommend that Mrs. Clinton not be charged over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state, Mr. Chaffetz led House Republicans in rejecting Mr. Comey’s conclusion.      Five days after the announcement, Mr. Chaffetz asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Mrs. Clinton had lied in her testimony before Congress about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Chaffetz had been one of the first lawmakers to raise questions about the Obama administration’s role in Benghazi, traveling to Libya less than a month after the attacks to evaluate security standards.      “It’s the nature of being the committee chairman to conduct oversight of the administration,” he said last year, describing his role as a pursuit of facts, not a political agenda.      But with Mr. Trump’s surprise victory in November, Mr. Chaffetz found himself in an uncomfortable position: a watchdog who often sounded disinclined to watch over a fellow Republican. ||||| When receiving donations of more than 200, candidates must report who gave, how much they gave and when. Of those bigger, itemized donations to Allen — some 66,300 — about 82 percent came from people outside of Utah. Boasting of 15,194 donors, Allen said she got at least one contribution from a resident in every state (as well as some foreign funds, which, according to campaign finance law, had to be returned).      None of Allen's contributions came from political action committees (PACs), though a few celebrities, including Nancy Sinatra, donated.      \\"I think people underestimate me and underestimate other Democrats,\\" said Allen, a 63-year-old physician and resident of Cottonwood Heights.      Her campaign went viral in early March when in less than a week, Allen went from 20,000 in an exploratory account to declaring her candidacy with 410,000 in donations. The reason for the spike? Chaffetz appeared on national television and remarked that \\"rather than get that new iPhone,\\" low-income Americans may have to prioritize spending on health care. Though he later sought to clarify the comment, angry people from across the country jumped on the fundraising site CrowdPac and flooded Allen with money.      It also catapulted Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, into action. The congressman had raised just 29,550 from the start of the year until the end of February. Then, beginning on March 6, his fundraising picked up significantly. He collected 123,050 in the last three weeks of the reporting period.      His campaign seized on Allen's success, sending emails to constituents encouraging them to rally around him. The messages warned that \\"this campaign is going to be unlike any other that I've ever seen,\\" and some focused on Rosie O'Donnell, a television star who has feuded with President Donald Trump in the past.      Chaffetz, with an active campaign team, spent all of the money he raised in the quarter and dipped into his reserves for 6,000 more. Still, he said his 402,700 in the bank is \\"plenty.\\"      \\"We're right where we need to be,\\" Chaffetz said. \\"This has never been a problem for me. The election is still a long time away.\\"      None of the five Democrats that Chaffetz has faced and demolished since his first win in 2008 spent more than 60,000, and the congressman also has never captured less than 65 percent of the vote in his largely Republican district. Allen's well-funded candidacy is unique and so is Chaffetz's dipping approval ratings. Just 52 percent of Chaffetz's constituents — far below previous ratings — approve of his performance, according to a March poll from Utah Policy.      Allen looks to capitalize on that \\"dissatisfaction,\\" particularly the tumult following the congressman's town hall in February and what residents see as unmet demands for him to investigate Trump as the House Oversight Committee chairman.      \\"The game has changed,\\" Allen said. \\"I think [my donations] reflect sentiments against the direction our government is going — and Chaffetz is a big part of that.\\"      Her experience in politics is limited to a three-year stint as a congressional aide in California, where she grew up, and two years spent working on a county housing program in the 1970s. She has worked as a doctor in Utah since the 1980s.      Other contenders in the congressional race include Republican Damian Kidd , who collected 15,500 in the first quarter and has spent all but 1,590 of it.      Chaffetz may also face a conservative challenge from former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin (who said he might run against Chaffetz or Sen. Orrin Hatch).      McMullin raised 5,000 and has 10,169 in cash on hand, though his presidential account also shows a debt of nearly 670,000.      ctanner@sltrib.com ||||| SALT LAKE CITY — Rep. Jason Chaffetz said the raucous reception he received at Thursday evening's town hall meeting was \\"bullying and an attempt at intimidation\\" from a crowd opposed to President Donald Trump's election.      \\"You could see it online a couple days before, a concerted effort in part to just cause chaos,\\" the Utah Republican said Friday. \\"Democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to deal with this.\\"      The relentless jeering at his and other recent congressional town halls around the country recall the tea party's reaction to President Barack Obama and Democrats, and comes as protests continue over Trump's policies.      Those protests include the women's marches held around the world that drew thousands of demonstrators to the Utah Capitol on the opening day of the 2017 Legislature last month.      Chris Karpowitz, co-director of BYU's Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, sees the parallels with the tea party movement, but he said it's too soon to say what impact the unrest coming from the left will have at the ballot box.      \\"I think there is a sense of unease and frustration about the Trump administration, and that concern is coming out in a variety of different ways, including in big demonstrations in major cities. But it's also touching us here in Utah,\\" he said.      That such strong anti-Trump sentiment is coming from one of the most Republican states in the country is surprising, said Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor and an active member of the GOP.      \\"The fact that it's happening in Utah as well as a lot of places signals there are a lot of people on the left who are still angry and energized,\\" Hagle said. \\"They're saying they want to be heard.\\"      Jason Perry, head of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics, said politicians need to pay attention.      \\"I think for a while this is going to be the new norm, people inserting themselves in the process and demanding some accountability from elected officials,\\" Perry said.      He, too, said it's unclear what that means for candidates in GOP-dominated Utah, where the tea party was able to unseat longtime Sen. Bob Bennett, a Republican, in 2010.      \\"I would not say there's reasons for Republicans right now to be concerned,\\" Perry said. \\"But there are reasons for them to continue to listen.\\"      Chaffetz said the crowd that filled the auditorium at Brighton High School in Cottonwood Heights and spilled over into a protest outside included people brought in from other states to disrupt the meeting.      \\"Absolutely. I know there were,\\" he said, suggesting it was \\"more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate\\" than a reflection of the feelings of his 3rd District constituents.      Asked who would foot the bill to fill the audience with outside agitators, Chaffetz said, \\"do some reporting\\" and described how one participant made it a point to say he was not being paid by a national Democratic organization.      But Rep. Marie Poulson, D-Cottonwood Heights, said she believed most of the estimated 1,000 attendees inside the high school auditorium — and at least that many who protested outside — were Chaffetz's constituents.      \\"I've heard some of my colleagues (at the Utah Legislature) say here today that they had shipped in liberals to give him a bad time,\\" Poulson said. \\"I serve that area and I listen to their frustrations.\\"      She said when she invited her own constituents to attend a legislative gathering held in Holladay on Thursday night, many in the politically moderate area said they were going to Chaffetz's town hall meeting instead.      \\"I had so many get back to me and say, 'We've been so upset by what Rep. Chaffetz is doing. We want him to investigate equally, with as much zeal as he did in the past, with this current administration,'\\" Poulson said.      And although Poulson said she doesn't approve of what she termed \\"some of the disrespect\\" shown to Chaffetz at the town hall meeting, she does \\"recognize that a lot of people are upset and angry.\\"      Don Peay of Utahns for Trump, who has close ties to the Trump family, said he walked out of the meeting that was punctuated by chants including \\"do your job\\" \\"you work for us\\" and \\"vote him out.\\"      \\"It was an angry mob of anarchists. It wasn't just Trump. They hated everything,\\" Peay said. \\"The behavior at the meeting was a hundred times worse than anything ever out of Trump's mouth.\\"      Some who attended the rally have taken issue with that characterization. Trump's critics and some supporters have lashed out at him over his crude comments about women, his mocking of a handicapped reporter, his temperament, among other issues. At one point during the campaign, Chaffetz said he couldn't look his wife and daughter in the eye and vote for Trump after his crude comments from a 2005 videotape were released. Chaffetz ultimately voted for Trump.      Another longtime Trump supporter, Senate Majority Leader Ralph Okerlund, R-Monroe, said \\"some of the discontent is just a result of disappointment in the election.\\"      But Okerlund said there's an edge to how that's being expressed.      \\"This is taking it to a new level. All of the demonstrations and some of the vehemence that we have not seen before,\\" he said. \\"We're just seeing this continued escalation of discontent by the side that isn't in charge.\\"      Much of the focus of the town hall was on whether Chaffetz, as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, would hold the president accountable.      Chaffetz said that was \\"ironic\\" since earlier Thursday he had called for \\"disciplinary action\\" against a White House counselor who apparently violated federal ethics rules by urging people to buy Ivanka Trump merchandise in a TV interview.      \\"I’ll never satisfy their desire to bring down Donald Trump. I’ll never satisfy that. It will never be good enough,\\" he said, noting that the president is exempt from conflict of interest laws and his business interests have long been widely known.      \\"People are asking me to use the power of Congress to do a full-on fishing expedition to investigate him personally on things that are not required by law. I think my doing that would be an abuse of power,\\" Chaffetz said.      The congressman said while it's \\"important that people have an opportunity to voice their concerns, I think they should be somewhat embarrassed by how a lot of people handled themselves.\\"      Chaffetz said he was trying to provide that opportunity by holding the town hall meeting.      \\"And I did hear them, but it was hard to hear through all the shouting and yelling,\\" including, he claimed, during the Pledge of Allegiance.      \\"That’s who these people are,\\" he said. \\"We’re better than that. That’s not what the average Utahn is like.\\"      A video of much of the Pledge of Allegiance posted on Facebook appears to show some members of the audience shouting at the end of the pledge, mostly emphasizing the last few words \\"indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\\" and then cheering afterward.      Posted by Andrew Ehninger on Saturday, February 11, 2017      Chaffetz said he will continue to make himself available to voters but may now avoid providing a venue \\"for these radicals to further intimidate.\\"      On Friday, he addressed the Utah State Board of Education, joking about his warm welcome.

Movie title: Apollo 13 Context: On July 20, 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell hosts a house party where guests watch on television as Neil Armstrong takes his first steps on the Moon. After the party, Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon and walk on its surface. On October 30, 1969, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that he and his crew will fly the Apollo 13 mission instead of Apollo 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is discovered to have been exposed to rubella, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert, as a safety precaution. Lovell initially resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband's safety, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for launch. After the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, an engine on the second stage cuts off prematurely, but the craft still reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage re-fires, sending Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert docks the Command/Service Module Odyssey with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pulls it away from the spent stage. Three days into the mission, the crew sends a live television transmission from Odyssey, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert performs a standard housekeeping procedure, one of two liquid oxygen tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. Mission Control aborts the Moon landing, Lovell and Haise hurriedly power up Aquarius as a \\"lifeboat\\" for the return home, and Swigert shuts down Odyssey before its battery power runs out.

Input: Passage: Henry XVI already had a dispute with Louis VII's father Stephen III. On 17 April 1414, Henry and other enemies of Louis VII founded the Parakeet Society.  On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII.  In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \\"the son of a cook\\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund.  Henry XVI wanted revenge. The conflict escalated into a war when an army from Bavaria-Ingolstadt burned down the castle of the Burgrave of Nuremberg. John III, who had succeeded his brother William II as Duke of Bavaria-Straubing in 1418, remained neutral.

Sentence 1: 1. Richard Biddle was the brother of Nicholas Biddle. 2. Richard Biddle was the nephew of Edward Biddle. 3. Richard Biddle was the uncle of Charles Biddle. Sentence 2: 1. Edward Biddle was the brother of Nicholas Biddle. 2. Edward Biddle was the uncle of Charles John Biddle. 3. Edward Biddle was the nephew of Richard Biddle. Now let's compare the sentences: 1. Both sentences mention that Richard and Edward Biddle were brothers of Nicholas Biddle, so this information is consistent. 2. Sentence 1 states that Richard Biddle was the nephew of Edward Biddle, while Sentence 2 states that Edward Biddle was the nephew of Richard Biddle. This information contradicts itself, as a nephew is a son of someone's sibling, not their uncle. It is impossible for both Richard and Edward to be each other's nephews. 3. Sentence 1 states that Richard Biddle was the uncle of Charles Biddle, while Sentence 2 states that Edward Biddle was the uncle of Charles John Biddle. If Charles Biddle and Charles John Biddle are the same person, this information is inconsistent, as both Richard and Edward cannot simultaneously be Charles' uncles unless they are siblings (which contradicts point 2). Based on this analysis, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. Therefore, the answer is [i] no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I was excited to get this because in the other reviews it says that it's loud enough, but the only draw back is the small blinking light. I received it, and immediately started to practice, and I wasn't even on a grand piano but my large upright totally drowned out the clicks, it was just way too quiet and there's no volume control volume so I was stuck with it. the light is also small, but not impossible to follow, the only problem with light is that it usually makes you delay just a little bit. So, yes, this metronome would be good if you have a digital keyboard, or perhaps a quieter instrument like acoustic guitar but to all the pianists, violinists, wind players, you will not be able to hear anything out of this metronome. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the metronome's lack of volume control and insufficient loudness, making it unsuitable for professional musicians playing certain instruments such as piano, violin, or wind instruments.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The more you play and watch, the faster and better you’ll get. Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts. While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward. and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game more fair. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top.  Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up. You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like. The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say \\"check\\" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player.  In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn. If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say \\"check\\" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand. For example, you could raise the ante 1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or \\"hold pat\\" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn. The dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet 10 and it's now your turn, you would say \\"call\\" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place 10 in chips or cash in the pot. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to \\"call\\" or \\"raise\\" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else \\"fold\\". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises.  If someone before you bets 20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it's your turn by saying “raise to 30.” However, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile. You can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash. You can usually return and watch the game after you cash in.

Answer:","output":"The best way to preheat the oven is: a). press the bake button on the oven, set to the desired temperature, then wait until the oven beeps at you to know that it is at the desired temperature. The justification for this choice is as follows: 1. Pressing the bake button activates the oven's baking function, which is designed to heat the oven evenly and maintain a consistent temperature throughout the entire space. This is ideal for preheating, as it ensures that the food will cook evenly once placed inside the oven. 2. Setting the oven to the desired temperature is important so that you can achieve the proper heat required for your specific recipe. Different types of food and baked goods require different temperatures to cook properly. 3. Waiting for the oven to beep or signal that it has reached the desired temperature is crucial since it confirms that your oven is now ready for baking.

Background: Lane was born Morton Donald Isaacson at the Manhattan \\"Flower Hospital\\" in New York City to a Jewish father (Jacob) and a Catholic mother (Dolly), who later converted to Judaism. Jacob \\"Jack\\" Isaacson was a sergeant in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and Dolly was a homemaker. He was raised in The Bronx, where he attended DeWitt Clinton High School and was classmates with Judd Hirsch and Garry Marshall. By his mid-teens, due to his mother's influential personality, Isaacson had decided he wanted to be in show business. Context: In 1965 the Irish comedian Dave Allen presented a talk show on Sydney television for TCN-9. He was eventually sacked and Nine producer John Collins looked for replacement hosts to fill in for the rest of the season. After a series of temporary hosts, Collins found Lane working in The Dunes Nightclub in Hawaii. While in the United States, Collins asked Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton if there was anybody he should consider as a replacement; Newton's answer was \\"Don Lane\\".  Lane was offered the job after filming and sending in an audition tape for the TCN-9 executives. He was given the host's chair for six weeks. He planned to base his version of the show on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Lane's run was variously referred to as The Tonight Show, Tonight with Don Lane and Sydney Tonight. Within a month, Nine settled on Lane as permanent host. After four weeks, his original six-week contract was extended to forty weeks.  Tonight with Don Lane featured comedy sketches, interviews with visiting entertainers and musical numbers often performed by Lane with the Tonight Show Orchestra. The announcer for the show was Mike Walsh, who later went on to host his own successful variety show.  Due to technical restrictions, Lane's tonight show was only broadcast throughout New South Wales, just as In Melbourne Tonight(IMT) was restricted to Victoria. Work on a coaxial cable linking Melbourne with Sydney had begun in June 1959 and was completed on 5 February 1963. On 7 July 1965, Lane appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with Graham Kennedy via the cable. Lane and Kennedy sang the song \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" as a duet. They took full advantage of the new technology and the duet included the performers throwing jugs of water and Kennedy holding up a sign saying \\"Go Home Yank\\", to which Lane laughed. Lane also performed another duet with Kennedy at the Logies ceremony in 1967.  In March 1968, Lane was charged with importing marijuana into Australia. He was arrested at Sydney Airport and remanded in custody. He strenuously protested his innocence, claiming that the drugs were planted into his jacket pocket by a former business associate who wanted revenge. He was found not guilty on all charges, being defended by barrister Marcus Einfeld. Question: What was Tonight with Don Lane?. Whats the answer?","output":"Tonight with Don Lane was a TV show in Australia. It was like a fun party where people could watch from their homes. Don Lane was the host, and he would do funny skits, talk to famous guests, and sometimes even sing and dance with a big band playing music. The show was like a big friend gathering for people to enjoy at night. It became very popular, and Don Lane stayed as the host for a long time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Marie Skłodowska Curie, a Polish and naturalized French physicist, had a small rocky island named after her near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago. Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist who made groundbreaking discoveries in physics and chemistry. She is best known for her research on radioactivity, a term she coined, and the discovery of the elements polonium (named after her homeland, Poland) and radium. Marie Curie moved to Paris, France, in 1891 to study at the prestigious Sorbonne University. In 1895, she married Pierre Curie, a French physicist, and they formed a powerful scientific partnership. Together, they conducted extensive research on radioactivity and discovered the phenomenon of induced radioactivity in 1898. Marie Curie's work in radioactivity and her findings on the radioactive properties of thorium, uranium, and the newly discovered elements earned her the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics, which she shared with Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel. In 1911, she also received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery and characterization of polonium and radium. Throughout her career, Marie Curie faced several challenges, including gender discrimination and struggles to secure funding for her research. Despite these obstacles, she persevered and continued to make significant scientific contributions, becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Her work has had a lasting impact on science, medicine, and the world at large, with her discoveries in radioactivity being critical to the development of cancer radiotherapy, the study of nuclear energy, and the understanding of the properties and structure of atoms. In honor of her immense contributions to science and her extraordinary achievements, a small rocky island near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago in Antarctica was named after her.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How do you keep the car between the lines on the road?","output":"Keeping a car between the lines on the road requires a combination of mental awareness, hand-eye coordination, and understanding of the car's dimensions and functioning. The key is to maintain consistent and smooth control of the car while being attentive to the road conditions and traffic. Here is a step-by-step guide to help someone accomplish this goal: 1. Familiarize yourself with the car: Get accustomed to the size and dimensions of the car, the position of the mirrors, and how the controls work, including the steering, accelerator, and brakes. Height and seat adjustments should be made to ensure clear visibility of the road and that all controls are within comfortable reach. 2. Check the mirrors: Before hitting the road, position the side and rearview mirrors to have a clear view of the surrounding traffic. Mirrors help in keeping track of nearby vehicles and maintaining spatial awareness. 3. Hold the steering wheel correctly: A crucial aspect of keeping a car between the lines is holding the steering wheel properly. Place your hands at the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions for optimal control. Maintain a firm grip on the wheel but avoid holding it too tightly, as it can cause fatigue and reduce control. 4. Look ahead and scan the road: Always keep your eyes focused on the road ahead and continuously scan your surroundings, including the road lines, traffic, pedestrians, and any potential obstacles. By staying alert and aware, you will be better prepared to make necessary adjustments to your course. 5. Use reference points: Utilize landmarks and reference points, such as the edge of the hood or the side mirrors, to help align your car with the road lines. Keep a mental note of these points to ensure your car remains in the correct position. 6. Maintain a safe distance: Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you to allow for sufficient reaction time in case of sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. This distance also helps in maintaining a clear sightline to the road lines. 7. Apply smooth steering inputs: To keep the car between the lines, smoothly and gradually turn the steering wheel in the desired direction. Making jerky or sudden movements can cause you to lose control and venture out of your lane. 8. Stay within the speed limit: Driving at appropriate speeds allows for better control of the car and easier lane maintenance. Adjusting speed depending on the road, traffic, and weather conditions is essential. 9. Regularly check your blind spots: Frequently check your blind spots by quickly glancing over your shoulder in addition to using the side mirrors, especially when changing lanes or merging onto highways. This ensures you are aware of vehicles outside your immediate field of vision. 10. Avoid distractions: Minimize distractions such as mobile phones, loud music, or engaging in activities that could divert your attention away from the road. Staying focused on driving is vital to keeping your car between the lines. 11. Practice, practice, practice: Like any skill, becoming proficient at maintaining your car within the lines requires practice. Commit to regular driving sessions in various conditions to build confidence and improve your proficiency. By following these steps and practicing consistently, drivers can learn to keep their car between the lines effectively and safely navigate the roads."},{"instruction":"Select from:  a). No;  b).

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in. Squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I said, \\"I wasn't done yet.\\" Ma said, \\"Your father's making breakfast in the restaurant.\\" That meant we should hurry, so I slid the brush over my teeth while Little Bit sat next to the sink, and then I ran out of the house.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Neil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with The Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd.  In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews--James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James--was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL. With their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer headed for Los Angeles, where they encountered Stills.

With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK, hard rock's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade. Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held. Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock, with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos. However, new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s. 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner, who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s. Midwestern groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock. In 1978, Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen. He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song \\"Eruption\\" from the album Van Halen, which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion, while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar. What two genres made inroads on hard rock in the 1970s? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The two genres that made inroads on hard rock in the 1970s were disco and punk rock."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What 's the maximum amount of money we have made from selling the watermelons ?","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling watermelons To determine the maximum amount of money made from selling the watermelons, we need to find out how many watermelons were sold at each price. We know that: - 1 watermelon was sold for 3 - 2 watermelons were sold for 5 - A total of 20 watermelons were sold. Step 2: Find the number of watermelons sold at each price point We should consider the highest revenue-generating scenario, which would be selling more watermelons at the 2 for 5 price point. Let's assume 'x' watermelons were sold at 1 for 3, and the rest were sold at 2 for 5. So, we can write the total number of watermelons sold as x + 2 * (20 - x). x + 2 * (20 - x) = 20 Step 3: Solve the equation Now we need to solve the equation to find the value of 'x': x + 40 - 2x = 20 x - 2x = 20 - 40 -x = -20 x = 20 This means that 20 watermelons were sold at 1 for 3, and 0 watermelons were sold at 2 for 5. We can now calculate the total revenue. Step 4: Calculate the maximum revenue Total revenue (1 for 3) = 20 watermelons * 3/watermelon = 60 Total revenue (2 for 5) = 0 * 5 = 0 So, the maximum amount of money made from selling the watermelons is 60."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.  Guess a valid title for it!

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chargers, the Broncos traveled to Reliant Stadium for an AFC match with the Houston Texans. The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. A 35-yard field goal by Bullock narrowed the Broncos' lead, but the Broncos increased it with two field goals from Prater in the final minute of the first half &#8212; a 25-yarder and a 44-yarder. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his 51st touchdown pass of the season &#8212; a 25-yarder to tight end Julius Thomas, in which Manning set a new NFL record for touchdown passes in a single season. With the win, coupled with the Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the Broncos clinched the AFC West division title. This was the 13th division title in the Broncos' franchise history, surpassing the Oakland Raiders for the all-time lead in AFC West championships since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. It also marked the first time in franchise history that the Broncos have clinched three consecutive AFC West division titles. How many points did the Texans have at the half?","output":"To find out how many points the Texans had at the half, we need to look at the scoring plays for the Texans in the first and second quarters: 1. In the first quarter, Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock scored a 45-yard field goal. 2. In the second quarter, Bullock scored another field goal, this time a 35-yard one. Each field goal is worth 3 points. So, to calculate the total points for the Texans at the half, we add the points from both field goals: 45-yard field goal (first quarter) = 3 points 35-yard field goal (second quarter) = 3 points Total points for the Texans at the half = 3 + 3 = 6 points"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Title: Disastrously Underwhelming and Highly Frustrating User Experience I am utterly disappointed to write this 1-star review for the app with the package org.telegram.messenger. As a person who constantly needs to keep in touch with different groups of friends, family, and work colleagues, I expected Telegram to be a reliable and convenient communication platform. However, my experience was contrary to my expectations, and I find it necessary to share my dissatisfaction with everyone to save them from the tumultuous ride I had with this app. Firstly, the app's signup process was a herculean task, which quickly became a vexing battle against time. The One-Time Password (OTP) that I was supposed to receive simply failed to reach my phone multiple times. Every time I requested another OTP, I encountered the same issue, leaving me utterly annoyed and frustrated. I would expect a messaging app to at least handle its basic communication features with ease, but this first step already proved to be a striking problem. Once I finally managed to register and enter the app, I was confronted with a user interface that was far from intuitive. It was a convoluted mess that made me dread using the app the moment I first laid my eyes on it. The features were overcomplicated and disorganized, making it difficult to locate specific functionalities. In today's world - where every other app aims for simplicity and a seamless user experience - it was astonishing to see how the Telegram developers missed the mark. Moreover, the messaging experience was consistently marred by slow message delivery and app crashes. My messages frequently got stuck in limbo before finally being delivered after ages. And not only that, the app crashed on multiple occasions, even after I tried to reinstall it. It was inconvenient and frustrating, to say the least. The thought of losing critical information had me stressed out and made me question my decision to use Telegram in the first place. Additionally, the security features of org.telegram.messenger were wholly underwhelming. As someone who values privacy, I was shocked to learn that the app's end-to-end encryption was only implemented in their \\"secret chats\\" feature, leaving my regular conversations vulnerable to malicious parties. This revelation heavily deterred me from discussing any sensitive information within the app. Lastly, the customer support was a disaster. They were unresponsive and unhelpful, offering absolutely no solutions when I contacted them regarding my numerous app-related issues. I spent hours trying to communicate with them, but my efforts were completely futile. With all these issues combined, I am confident in saying that the org.telegram.messenger app should be avoided at all costs. It is an inferior communication platform that taints the messaging experience with its unreliable, frustrating, and insecure foundation. If you are looking for a better alternative, I highly suggest exploring other options readily available in the app stores, as they are leaps and bounds ahead of Telegram Messenger."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Translate to Romanian","output":"\\"Aceasta reprezintă conducerea Uniunii Europene în conformitate cu metoda comunitară.\\" Metoda comunitară se referă la procesul decizional și la modul în care sunt adoptate politicile în cadrul Uniunii Europene. Această metodă implică un grad ridicat de cooperare între instituțiile europene, cum ar fi Comisia Europeană, Consiliul Uniunii Europene și Parlamentul European. În esență, metoda comunitară reprezintă baza cooperării și guvernării în cadrul UE. Principiile metodei comunitare includ: 1. Supranaționalitate: Deciziile luate în cadrul UE sunt realizate de instituții supranaționale care își sprijină membrilor să lucreze împreună pentru a aborda provocările cu care se confruntă întregul continent european. Acest concept diferă de cooperarea interguvernamentală, în care guvernele naționale își păstrează controlul asupra deciziilor și acțiunilor. 2. Partajarea suveranității: Statele membre își transferă o parte din suveranitatea lor națională în favoarea instituțiilor UE în domenii specifice, cum ar fi comerțul sau mediul, pentru a permite crearea și implementarea de politici comune. 3. Respectarea dreptului comunitar: Legislația UE este direct aplicabilă în toate statele membre, iar sistemele juridice naționale trebuie să respecte și să pună în aplicare aceste legi. Dacă există conflicte între dreptul UE și legile naționale, dreptul comunitar primează. 4. Procesul decizional bazat pe consens: În cadrul metodei comunitare, deciziile sunt luate în strânsă colaborare între instituțiile europene și statele membre. Acest lucru se face, de obicei, prin votare și negociere, cu scopul de a se ajunge la un consens și de a asigura că toate părțile interesate au un cuvânt de spus în proces. 5. Rolul central al Comisiei Europene: Comisia Europeană are un rol central în procesul decizional al metodei comunitare, deoarece este responsabilă pentru elaborarea propunerilor legislative și pentru asigurarea respectării legislației UE. De asemenea, Comisia răspunde în fața Parlamentului European, ceea ce contribuie la responsabilitatea democratică în cadrul UE. În concluzie, metoda comunitară reprezintă o abordare centrală în conducerea și adoptarea politicilor în cadrul Uniunii Europene, bazată pe colaborarea strânsă între statele membre și instituțiile europene, respectarea supranaționalității și partajarea suveranității și aplicarea uniformă a dreptului comunitar în întregul bloc."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She believed her best chance to be heard was through sheer repetition, so Rachel Crooks took her seat at the dining table and prepared to tell the story again. She was used to difficult audiences, to skeptics and Internet trolls who flooded her Facebook page with threats, but this was a generous crowd: a dozen women, all friends of her aunt, gathered for a casual dinner party on a Friday night. The hostess turned off the music, clanked a fork against her wineglass and gestured to Crooks. “Would you mind telling us about the famous incident?” she asked. “Not the sound-bite version, but the real version.”      “The real version,” Crooks said, nodding back. She took a sip of water and folded a napkin onto her lap.      Rachel Crooks is one of the 19 women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual assault.      “It all happened at Trump Tower,” she said. “I had just moved to New York, and I was working as a secretary for another company in the building. That’s where he forced himself on me.”      Crooks, 35, had been publicly reliving this story for much of the past two years, ever since she first described it in an email to the New York Times several months before the 2016 election. “I don’t know if people will really care about this or if this will matter at all,” she had written then, and after Donald Trump’s election she had repeated her story at the Women’s March, on the “Today” show and at a news conference organized by women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred. Crooks had spoken to people dressed in #MeToo sweatshirts and to her rural neighbors whose yards were decorated with Trump signs. In early February, she launched a campaign to become a Democratic state representative in Ohio, in part so she could share her story more widely with voters across the state. And yet, after dozens of retellings, she still wasn’t sure: Did people really care? Did it matter at all?      Despite her story, and the similar stories of more than a dozen other women, nothing had changed. Trump, who had denied all of the accusations, was still president of the United States, and Crooks was still circling back to the same moments on Jan. 11, 2006, that had come to define so much about her life.      Rachel Crooks holds a photograph of herself from the time when she worked at Trump Tower.      “He was waiting for the elevator outside our office when I got up the nerve to introduce myself,” she said now, remembering that day when she was 22 years old and Trump was 59. “It’s not like I was trying to upset the apple cart. I don’t know. Maybe I was being naive.”      The hostess shook her head and then reached for Crooks’s hand. “You did absolutely nothing wrong,” she said.      “Thank you,” Crooks said, even though she sometimes still wondered. She reached for her water glass and lifted it up into the air to use as a prop. “He took hold of my hand and held me in place like this,” she said, squeezing the sides of the water glass, shaking it gently from side to side. “He started kissing me on one cheek, then the other cheek. He was talking to me in between kisses, asking where I was from, or if I wanted to be a model. He wouldn’t let go of my hand, and then he went right in and started kissing me on the lips.”      She shook the water glass one final time and set it down. “It felt like a long kiss,” she said. “The whole thing probably lasted two minutes, maybe less.”      “Like you were another piece of his property,” the hostess said.      “And with those orange lips!” another woman said.      Everyone at the table began to talk at the same time about Trump, and Crooks pushed her chair back and nodded along. She understood by now that for everyone else this was a story about the president — about what he had or hadn’t done during those two minutes, and what that said about his morality and the character of the country that voted him into office. But the story Crooks was still trying to understand was her own, about what those two minutes had meant for her.      The hostess clinked her glass again to quiet the room. “Sorry, but can we go back to the kiss for a second?”      “Sure,” Crooks said, and then she started to tell it again.      Crooks gets ready for work at her home in Tiffin.      There were 19 women in all who made public accusations of sexual misconduct, or “The Nineteen,” as they had come to be known on T-shirts and bumper stickers. Most had come forward with their stories after Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, and the experiences they described having with him spanned five decades. They claimed Trump had “acted like a creepy uncle,” or “squeezed my butt,” or “eyed me like meat,” or “stuck his hand up under my skirt,” or “groped with octopus hands,” or “pushed me against a wall,” or “thrust his genitals,” or “forced his tongue into my mouth” or “offered 10,000 for everything.”      In response, Trump had called the accusations against him “total fabrications” based on “political motives” to destroy his campaign and then his presidency. “Nothing ever happened with any of these women,” Trump tweeted once. “Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!”      One woman accused Trump of assaulting her in the middle of a commercial flight after they met as seatmates in the 1970s. Another said it happened in a conference room during the middle of a job interview. Another, a journalist for People magazine, said Trump forced his tongue into her mouth as they finished an interview for a feature story about his marriage to Melania. The list of accusers included a reality-TV host, a runner-up on “The Apprentice,” a yoga instructor, an adult-film star and several women who had competed in Trump’s beauty pageants: a Miss New Hampshire, Miss Washington, Miss Arizona and Miss Finland.      And then there was Crooks, who had never been on reality TV, never drank alcohol, never met anyone famous until she moved from her childhood home in Green Springs to New York City in the summer of 2005. Nobody else in three generations of her family had ever seen the appeal in leaving Green Springs, population 1,300, but nobody else was quite like her: striking and self-assured at 6 feet tall; all-state in basketball, volleyball and track; the high school salutatorian and “Most Likely to Succeed.” She wanted to backpack across Europe, earn her doctorate, work in high-end fashion and live in a skyscraper that looked out over something other than an endless grid of brown-and-green soybean fields. “New York is where you can make things happen,” she had written to a friend back then, and a few weeks after graduating from college she persuaded her high school boyfriend, Clint Hackenburg, to move with her.      They rented a room in a cheap group house way out in Bay Ridge, and she took the first job she could find on Craigslist to pay rent, at an investment firm in Trump Tower called Bayrock. Her secretarial tasks were to make coffee, water the two office palm trees, polish the gold-trimmed mirrors, straighten the tassels on the Oriental rug at the entryway and sit at a mahogany welcome desk to greet visitors who came through the glass front doors.      She found the work mindless and demeaning, but all around her was the promise of New York. There was Oprah Winfrey, filming a TV show next to the two-story Christmas wreath in the main lobby. There was George Clooney, strolling past the office. There was Trump, an occasional business partner with Bayrock, standing right outside the glass doors every few days with his bodyguard as he waited for the elevator to take him back to his 100 million penthouse on the 66th floor. She remembered that sometimes he looked in and smiled at her. At least once she thought she saw him wave. “If you’re working in that building, you’ve got to at least meet him,” Hackenburg told her, and after five months Crooks finally got up from her desk and went out to say hello. It was early in the morning, and the office was mostly empty. She walked toward Trump, who she remembers was standing by himself in the small waiting area near the elevators. She held out her hand, intent on introducing herself not as a fan or as a secretary but as a business partner.      “Mr. Trump, I wanted to say hi, since our companies do a little work together,” she remembered telling him that day, and then, before she understood what was happening, she remembered Trump becoming the second man ever to kiss her.      “Fiction,” was what Trump’s campaign called her story when Crooks first told it publicly in 2016. “It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged,” the campaign said.      But Crooks’s version of that day was prompting more and more questions in her mind. Why did she sometimes feel as if he was still holding her in place? Why had she spent so much of the past decade recoiling from that moment — back behind the receptionist desk, back inside of her head, back home to the certainty and simplicity of small-town Ohio? It was just a dreadful kiss, or at least that’s what she kept trying to tell herself to quiet the confusion that had grown out of that moment, turning into shame, hardening into anxiety and insecurity until nearly a decade later, when she first started to read about other women whose accusations sounded so much like her own. Kissed at a party. Kissed in a dance club. Kissed during a business meeting. Kissed while attending a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Largo. “For the first time, I started to think it wasn’t my fault for being clueless and naive, or for something I did wrong in seeming that way to him,” Crooks said in one of her first public statements about Trump in 2016. Maybe together with the other accusers their stories had power, Crooks thought. Maybe, if the accusations alone weren’t enough to hold Trump accountable for his behavior, the women could force the country to pay attention with better messaging and greater theatrics.      Late in 2017, Crooks agreed to join several accusers for television interviews and news conferences in New York. “A call to action,” the invitation read, because their goal was to demand a congressional investigation into Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct. Crooks wrote herself some reminders for effective public speaking: “Use detail and repetition.” “Make it personal.” “Focus on solutions.” She volunteered to speak first, squared her shoulders and then turned to face the cameras with the poise of the athlete she had been.      “By now all of you are probably familiar with my story,” she said before beginning it again. The 24th floor. His lips coming toward hers. His hands holding her in place until the elevator arrived to take him upstairs. “Feelings of self-doubt and insignificance,” she said.      “I know there are many worse forms of sexual harassment, but doesn’t this still speak to character?” she said. “I don’t want money. I don’t need a lawsuit. I just want people to listen. How many women have to come forward? What will it take to get a response?”      Crooks at her office at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, where she works as a recruiter. A Trump flag hangs on a house in Green Springs, Ohio, the town where Crooks grew up.      Left: Crooks at her office at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, where she works as a recruiter. Right: A Trump flag hangs on a house in Green Springs, Ohio, the town where Crooks grew up.      The response that came was waiting every day on Crooks’s computer, so one morning back home in Ohio she woke up and walked downstairs to her laptop. The front door was locked, the shades were drawn, and she sat next to the dog she had recently bought with hopes that a pet might help reduce her anxiety. She navigated to Facebook. “Good morning, Rachel!” read a greeting at the top of her page, and then she clicked open her messages.      “Very unbelievable story,” read the first. “Try and get rich some other way.”      “You ignorant, attention seeking cow.”      “Nobody would touch you, especially not Trump. You look like a boy. A gun to your head would be good for our nation.”      She had tried changing the privacy settings on her Facebook page and logging off Twitter, but there was no way to barricade herself from so much hostility. It came into her email inbox at the tiny college in Ohio where she worked as a recruiter of international students. It came when she walked her dog around the block or took her nephews trick-or-treating. “So many stares and weird comments that give me social anxiety,” was how she explained it once to a friend, because now each interaction required a series of calculations. Two thirds of people in Seneca County had voted for Trump. Ninety-four percent of Trump supporters told pollsters that their views were “not impacted” by the sexual harassment allegations against him. So Crooks wondered: Did the majority of her friends, co-workers and neighbors think she was lying? Or, even worse in her mind, did they believe her but simply not care?      “An honest, timeless, values-first community” was how one tourism slogan described Seneca County, and Crooks had always believed those things to be true. Her father had worked 39 years as a mechanic at Whirlpool and then retired with a decent pension. Her sister was raising four children in the same converted farmhouse where Crooks had grown up. Everybody in town knew her family — four generations of Crooks clustered within a few square blocks — so a local newspaper had interviewed community members about Crooks’s allegations against Trump. “A fine, wholesome young girl,” her high school volleyball coach told the paper, and that seemed to Crooks like the most Ohio compliment of all. But then the story ended and the comments began, and Crooks kept reading because she knew some of the commenters, too.      “I’m a friend of the family. She’s lying.”      “If he was going to make a move on a woman, it wouldn’t be her!”      “We know Trump has class, so why would he waste his time on some average chick like this?”      In her “values-first” community, it now felt to Crooks as if politics had become a fissure that was always deepening, the facts distorted by both sides, until even her own family no longer agreed on what or whom to believe. Her parents and sister supported her, even if they disliked talking about politics. Her grandmother, a staunch conservative, hugged Crooks after reading the original article about Trump’s harassment in the New York Times but then sometimes talked admiringly about Trump. Another of her relatives was often posting laudatory stories about the president on Facebook and dismissing many of the attacks against him as purely political, until one day Crooks decided to email her.      “Your candidate of choice kissed me without my consent,” Crooks wrote, and then she began to wonder whether there was some way to tell her story, or some piece of evidence, that could change her relative’s mind. During one news conference, she had asked Trump to release the security videotapes from the 24th floor that day, but he never responded. She had not heard from him, or anyone representing him, since she came home from New York. “What can I ever do to prove this happened and that it impacted my life?” she said.      Maybe the proof was the email she had sent to her mother, from the Bayrock office in New York, at 1:27 that afternoon in 2006: “Hey Ma, my day started off rough…had a weird incident with Mr. Trump.”      Or the email she sent a few hours later to her sister at 3:05 p.m.: “I must just appear to be some dumb girl that he can take advantage of…ugh!”      Or the email she sent a few days after that to another relative: “Ah yes, the Donald kiss…very creepy man, let me tell you!”      Or the recorded conversation between Trump and Billy Bush on an “Access Hollywood” bus late in 2005, months before Crooks says she met Trump by the elevators: “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”      “By all means, have your opinions,” Crooks wrote to her relative instead, because more and more she believed no version of her story could bridge the widening divide.      “It makes me ill, to be quite honest with you . . . when my own family members not only vote for but publicly defend this person,” she wrote. “For my own sanity, I will not engage you further on this.”      Rachel Crooks, back right, meets with the Get Rachel Elected group at her home in Tiffin. Crooks announced in early February that she is running for state representative in Ohio.      And then there was one of her other relatives, her aunt, Barbara Radebaugh, who was often encouraging her niece to engage and to fight. “Keep speaking your truth!” Radebaugh wrote to her, and she invited Crooks to Columbus in late January to participate in the second annual Women’s March. The two of them had traveled together from Ohio to the inaugural march in Washington on a bus with several dozen strangers, and now many of those women gathered again in Columbus for a small reunion a few hours before the march.      “What a transformative, empowering year,” Radebaugh said to the group, because one of the women from that bus ride had become a Democratic fundraiser, another had started volunteering for reproductive rights, another had joined the board of the local Pride parade, and two more were running for seats in the Ohio House of Representatives. Crooks had yet to officially launch her campaign, but Mary Relotto had already raised 20,000, knocked on thousands of doors and filed all of her paperwork. She was scheduled to give a kickoff speech in Columbus, and now she asked Crooks whether she would be willing to share her story about Trump during the march.      “You are an inspiration to me,” Relotto told her. “I want to champion you, to champion each other. Your voice and your story in this is huge.”      “Thank you,” Crooks said. “I don’t always feel that way, but —”      “It’s huge. So let me ask you: Do you want to engage with the people?”      “I don’t know. This feels more like your moment.”      “Thank you, but the people need to see a face. You have a powerful story. It’s up to you how far you want to take it. What do you want to do?”      It was the same question Crooks’s sister had asked over the phone that morning in 2006, minutes after Trump got onto his elevator and Crooks retreated back to an empty office at Bayrock to call home. “What do you want to do?” her sister had asked, and together they had gone through the options. Report the harassment to building security guards who wore Trump’s name on their uniforms? Tell her managers at Bayrock, where Trump was a key business partner? Confide in Bayrock’s founder, Tevfik Arif, a personal friend of Trump and his wife, Melania?      The only thing she could think to do instead of reporting it was go quietly back to her desk for the afternoon and then back to the rental house to tell Hackenburg. Maybe she had done something to encourage Trump, she said. Maybe she wasn’t coming across as smart, serious or professional. “Her self-confidence was absolutely rocked,” Hackenburg said.      She went back to Bayrock during the next weeks and tried to duck into the office kitchen whenever she noticed Trump waiting at the elevator. She remembered him smiling at her one day and smiling politely back. She remembered him coming in another day to ask for her phone number, saying he wanted to pass it along to a modeling agency, and because her co-workers were standing nearby and she couldn’t think up an excuse, she gave it to him. Why couldn’t she stand up for herself? What was wrong with her? Why hadn’t she shouted at him, or quit her job, or pushed him away, or bit his lip? She blamed Trump for making her feel powerless. She blamed herself for caving into shame and self-doubt. Ten months after moving to New York, she was on her way back to rural Ohio — the place she had never imagined living, and the place she had remained ever since.      Rachel Crooks plays with her dog Carlow at the Tiffin Bark Park.      She didn’t think of it as a tragedy. She had gone on to graduate school in Ohio, bought a home close to her family, in the nearby town of Tiffin, and begun a career that allowed to her travel around the world, but she also believed some small part of her had never come back from New York. “It was one of the first real failures or defeats of my life, where the world wasn’t what I hoped it was going to be, and I started to really doubt myself,” she said.      For several years she had barely told anybody about Trump, because she assumed nothing would come of her story. Now she had spent 18 months repeating it and proving herself right.      “I am not sure I’ve changed one person’s mind,” she said.      But what choice did she have, except to let it go silent as if it never happened at all? She didn’t want to retreat anymore from that moment, to cycle back into self-doubt. So she would go on television. She would speak at the news conferences. She would deal with the hate mail. She would run for office. She would repeat her story over and over whenever she was asked, even now, to a few women in Columbus marching alongside her in the snow.      “It happened right by the elevators,” she said, beginning the story again, even if she was telling it mostly for herself. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Article: After we finished thirteen miles of hiking, we were tired and our muscles ached as we made our way back to New England. The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed. When we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style. As we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess  was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs. As the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \\"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \\"Excuse me.\\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer. After a few moments she returned to our seats. \\"I can tell you work with the public,\\" she said. \\"Why do you think so?\\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \\"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\\" The sense of belonging to the elite  group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words. Our first class seats offered us more than a comfortable ride. We were reminded that without kindness, we would be flying in no class. Question: Where did the writer ever go hiking?

Maybe not the first metamovie, but certainly the one that popularized the genre. 2. ...a fun, well-paced slasher... 3. a nineties-style teenage slasher movie with just enough tongue-in-cheek understanding of its own silliness to make it gruesomely fun without being insulting 4. The picture is so full of cross-references, self-mockery and movies within movies (including a stalking that's recorded on video) that it can't help turning into a precious two-hour in-joke. 5. The movie's only wrinkle is that it is, in a crude fashion, post-modernist. Pardon me while I alert the media. 6. By the time Scream arrives at its final twist, Craven has done too many contortions of his own to give the finale much shock value. 7. The movie contains the usual stock horror characters, but they are supplied with dialogue, often surprisingly smart and funny, that serves as a running, biting commentary on slasher conventions. 8. Remains a highly polished piece of meta-slasher mayhem. 9. Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street. 10. It is a fright film that takes elements from classics that evoked the screamin' meemies and reinvents melodramatic applications offering a new spin to slice-and-dice antics. Gallows humor runs rampant, too. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"The overall consensus about the movie is that it's a fun and entertaining film that is different from other scary movies because it makes fun of itself and has some clever and funny lines. People liked how it played with the usual scary movie rules and added some new twists.

Scherer was personally awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves by Adolf Hitler for the command of the defense of Kholm .","output":"Yes, both sentences have the same meaning. Here's the step-by-step breakdown and justification of the changes made in the original sentence to obtain the second sentence: 1. In the first sentence, \\"For Kholm's command of the defense,\\" is moved to the end of the sentence to become \\"for the command of the defense of Kholm.\\" This rearrangement maintains the meaning, which indicates that Scherer was awarded for commanding the defense of Kholm. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Scherer was personally awarded\\" is moved to the beginning of the sentence. This change keeps the focus on Scherer as the main subject who received the award. 3. The phrases \\"knight's cross of the Iron Cross with oak foliage\\" and \\"Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves\\" mean the same thing. The capitalization of \\"Knight's Cross\\" and \\"Oak Leaves\\" does not change the meaning. The difference in wording between \\"oak foliage\\" and \\"Oak Leaves\\" is just a synonym for the same decorative element of the award. It is important to note that \\"Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves\\" is the most commonly used and accurate term for the award. 4.

So, let's add them together:  57 * i - 29 * i = (57 - 29) * i = 28 * i Now our problem looks like this: -91 * i = 28 * i + 2380 2. Next, let's help \\"i\\" by adding 91 * i to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -91 * i on the left side: -91 * i + 91 * i = 28 * i + 91 * i + 2380 0 = 119 * i + 2380 3. Now, we have 119 * i + 2380. We want to find out how many candies \\"i\\" has, so we need to remove 2380 from the total. To do that, we'll subtract 2380 from both sides: 119 * i + 2380 - 2380 = 0 - 2380 119 * i = -2380 4. Lastly, we want to find out how many candies \\"i\\" has, so we need to divide both sides by 119: 119 * i / 119 = -2380 / 119 i = -20 So, our little letter friend \\"i\\" has -20 candies, which means \\"i\\" actually owes someone 20 candies!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their dominating win over the Saints, the Broncos traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Cincinnati Bengals. A 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos an early lead, but the Bengals countered in the second quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos added to their lead, when return specialist Trindon Holliday took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a touchdown. However, the Bengals would reel off 17 unanswered points, consisting of a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andy Dalton to wide receiver A. J. Green, a 49-field goal by Nugent followed in the fourth quarter by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, with the latter two scores coming off Manning interceptions. This gave Cincinnati a 20-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next possession, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. Ten plays into the Bengals' next possession, Dalton was intercepted by cornerback Champ Bailey at the Bengals' 46-yard line, and the Broncos subsequently added to their lead eight plays later, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai.

Luther, a once well-respected engineer and researcher, emerges from the city's vast network of sewers, tormented by his past. Haunted by a series of unfortunate events, Luther had found solace in the cold darkness of the underground tunnels, away from the unforgiving society that cast him out. As Alice investigates Luther's past, she discovers that he had been working on a top-secret government project – a project that could have catastrophic ramifications for the entire city. This diabolical invention, buried deep within the sewers, holds the key to the sudden string of disappearances that has gripped the city. Their encounter puts Luther and Alice into a reluctant alliance, as they strive to right the wrongs of Luther's past, while unraveling the mystery of the missing people. As they venture deeper into the labyrinth of the underworld, they must confront dangerous thugs, toxic surroundings, and the nauseating truth of human greed and corruption. As the stakes grow increasingly higher, Luther grapples with his inner demons and finds redemption in the most unexpected of places – his genius talent for engineering and inventive mind come to their aid in the darkest of moments.

Summarize this article: Card counters are notorious for playing blackjack for hours and hours, often without eating or enjoying the amenities available at the resort. Acting like a tourist just looking for a simple good time may take the suspicion off of you. You want to blend in. Busting out your three-piece Armani suit is not what you want to do when starting your card counting career at your local casino. Leave the Italian suede at home and act like a regular Joe. Dealers are trained to shuffle the deck upon an unexplainable increase in the bet. For this reason, only up your bet in small increments and at seemingly random points in the game. This may seem counter to making money, but if you get thrown out, you'll be making zero. No, card counting isn't illegal, but it is heavily frowned upon and you can be asked to never return. This is why we had you practicing with the TV, radio, and several messy, loud-mouthed children. If you are so busy counting your lips are practically moving, it's a dead giveaway. Go ahead, get a drink, make small talk. Enjoy yourself.  Counters have a reputation for being \\"zoned in\\" to the game.  He will remain fixated on their cards while everyone else is looking at a gorgeous woman. Don't be that guy. You need to be proficient enough at counting that you can carry on a conversation.  Chat with the dealer about how their day is going.  If the pit boss comes up, chat with him, too. Many dealers know how to count cards.  A dealer that likes you will be more likely to wait before shuffling on a favorable deck and shuffle sooner on a bad one. A dealer can help you or hurt you.  Motivate the dealer to be for you. Same goes for the entire pit crew -- get them on your side, your not-so-heinous crime may slide under their radar. At any time, there are hundreds of cameras going on in the casino in addition to the eyes of the dealers, those in the pit (behind the tables), and the security staff. If they'll catch a waitress for serving a customer every 18.37 minutes, they'll definitely have the attention span to monitor you. Because of this, it's very important to be on your best behavior. If a casino suspects you're counting, they probably won't come right out and say it. They may have someone start a conversation with you to distract you, assign you a high-speed dealer, shuffle spontaneously or change the betting rules. If any of these happen, back down slowly, but immediately. When you hit a table, stay there for a spell. Why would you leave? And when you make your moves at this table, take a second to think about it. Normal blackjack players haven't spent the past three months staring at this exact set up in black and white. Everything you do needs to be nonchalant and casual. Do not jump from table to table every time the deck sours.  This will bring you to the attention of the casino personnel fast.  Make minimum bets until the deck is richer. Increase casually because you're doing well -- not because you know what's about to come.","output":"Card counters often spend long hours at blackjack tables, often foregoing eating or enjoying other amenities of the resort. To avoid suspicion, it's advised to act like an ordinary tourist, avoiding flashy clothing and making small, random bets. Increasing unusually can cause the dealer to shuffle the deck and affect the game. While card counting is not illegal, it is widely disapproved and can result in being asked to never return to the casino. Therefore, it's important to not become overly engrossed in counting, instead maintaining a casual demeanor and engaging in conversations with the dealer and pit boss. Many dealers know how to count cards and if they're friendly with you, they might delay shuffling on a favorable deck. Casinos are full of surveillance and keen staff, so any suspicious behavior could be noted. If casinos suspect you're counting, they might try to divert your attention or change rules. If this happens, retreat carefully. It's recommended to stay at one table and keep your demeanor and betting casual, as frequent table changes could be attention-grabbing."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience.  The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.  For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there. Was their plan successful?","output":"Yes, their plan was successful. David Monroe Shoup and his fellow Marines faced heavy resistance on the beaches of Tarawa, but they were able to rally and push inland. With Shoup's strong leadership, they kept launching aggressive attacks against the Japanese defenders. By the second day of the attack, the American troops were winning the battle, and more reinforcements arrived to help them. Eventually, they secured Tarawa, which was an important victory during World War II.

Movie title: Terminator Salvation Movie plot: In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign his body over for medical research following his execution by lethal injection. One year later, the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as Judgment Day (see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines). In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a small nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted \\"kill list\\" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in four days' time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance to Skynet, but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father (see The Terminator). John meets with his officer Barnes (Common) and wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and sends radio broadcasts to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and his mute companion Star (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle relates to Marcus the events of Judgment Day and the ensuing war between humans and machines. Hearing John's radio broadcast, the three leave Los Angeles in search of the... Answer:","output":"In the sci-fi action film \\"Terminator Salvation\\", it is Dr. Serena Kogan who convinces Marcus Wright to sign over his body for medical research. The character of Dr. Kogan is portrayed by actress Helena Bonham Carter, while Marcus Wright is played by Sam Worthington. The film, which is set predominantly in the year 2018, sheds light upon Marcus Wright's backstory through a series of flashbacks to the year 2003. At this time, Wright is seen as an inmate on death row, awaiting execution by lethal injection for his crimes. It is here when he is visited by Dr. Serena Kogan, a representative of Cyberdyne Systems, a high-tech corporation. Dr. Kogan is shown to be terminally ill, dreadfully seeking a cure or way to prolong her life. She presents Wright with a prospect that promises him a chance to ensure his life would still hold some meaning after his execution. In the deal, despite his death, his physique would contribute to the advancement of medical research and potentially assist in improving or saving lives in the future. Being convinced by Dr. Kogan's heartfelt appeal and the perspective of redemption, Marcus consents to sign his body over for research. Unbeknownst to him, this decision ultimately results in his consciousness being implanted into a Terminator, and he becomes a linchpin in Cyberdyne's development of Skynet, an artificial intelligence system that perceives humanity as a threat leading to a catastrophic event known as Judgment Day. In the grand scheme of the film's narrative, Marcus plays a major role in the following events, including saving the life of Kyle Reese, who is significant to the survival of John Conner, the leader of the Resistance against Skynet. Despite having been manipulated into becoming a pawn for Cyberdyne Systems, Marcus retains his humanity and fights for the cause of the Resistance, underlining the moral complexities of identity and the human spirit.  This is just a portion of the intricate plot within \\"Terminator Salvation\\", where each character's motivations, actions, and fate are interwoven into a thrilling narrative about survival, redemption, and the thin line between man and machine. If the film proposal you're considering contains such complex character arcs, a well-built plot, and evokes philosophic contemplations along with high-paced action scenes, it is definitely worth considering for investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This courageous act not only highlights the importance of vigilance in ensuring the safety of premises, but also demonstrates the ways in which a company slogan can be turned into a powerful statement in a high-pressure situation. The Incident It was a day just like any other when the unsuspecting employee encountered the event that would forever change their life. As they went about their regular duties, a masked individual entered the establishment, brandishing a weapon and demanding cash from the premises.  Faced with a situation like nothing they had ever experienced before, the employee knew they had to think quickly and remain calm to protect themselves, their colleagues, and the customers present in the store. As their mind raced through possible courses of action, inspiration struck from an unlikely source. The Power of a Slogan \\"Go run on Dunkin!\\" This phrase, made famous by the popular international coffee and doughnut company Dunkin' Donuts, has been used to promote the idea that their products can provide the fuel to keep people going throughout their busy lives.  In that moment, the employee seized the opportunity to use this familiar slogan in a powerful statement of defiance against the would-be robber. With a confident smile, the employee repeated the phrase, \\"Go run on Dunkin'!\\" as they continued to stand their ground.  The Effect Taken aback by the boldness of this impassioned declaration, the robber found themselves unsure of how to proceed. Whether it was the familiarity of the slogan or the employee's unwavering courage that threw them off, the cracking of their confidence was evident. As they hesitated and glanced around nervously, it became clear that the power dynamics in the room had shifted dramatically. With the help of their coworkers, the employee was able to use the momentum of their bold action to dissuade the would-be thief from committing the crime. Recognizing that they had lost their advantage, the robber began to retreat, but not without the employee issuing one last reminder to, \\"Go run on Dunkin'!\\" The Aftermath and the Importance of Preparedness In the aftermath of this harrowing incident, the employee has been hailed as a hero for their quick thinking and courage under pressure. Their actions have encouraged other businesses and individuals to educate themselves on appropriate safety procedures and responses to such situations. Though it may not always be advisable to engage an assailant directly, the importance of remaining calm and actively assessing the situation in order to make the best decision cannot be understated. The story of the employee who used the words \\"Go run on Dunkin'\\" to foil a robbery attempt serves as a reminder that, with the right attitude, even the most challenging situations can be overcome. Whether it's a company slogan or personal motto, the power of words, paired with determination and courage, can make all the difference in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that \\"Two men wearing matching white t-shirts and headphones are leaning over working on something.\\" Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims, \\"A couple of black guys in white t-shirts are leaning over a project.\\" Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention two men wearing white t-shirts, leaning over an object. However, the premise does not provide any information regarding the men's race, while the hypothesis specifies that they are black. Additionally, the premise mentions the men are wearing headphones, which the hypothesis does not. Step 4: Evaluate if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true. Since the premise does not provide any information about the men's race, we cannot confirm or refute the part of the hypothesis that refers to them as black. Additionally, the missing detail about the headphones in the hypothesis makes the hypothesis incomplete in relation to the premise.

The answer to the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church is inside the article: During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

In the given statement, \\"A man in black taking his leashed cat on a walk,\\" there are a few key pieces of information that will help us make our conclusion. First, let's consider the subject of the statement: \\"A man in black.\\" Although the color of his clothes does not necessarily matter, this part of the statement does clarify that there is a man in the scenario. Next, we need to analyze the action that the man is performing: \\"taking his leashed cat on a walk.\\" Here, we can determine that the man is engaging in an activity where he is walking and is accompanied by his cat, which is leashed. There is a clear indication that the man is taking the cat for a walk, and that the cat is a pet under his care. Given these descriptions, it is reasonable to conclude that the scenario depicted can be simplified to \\"A man walking his pet.\\" This is because the man is walking and is also in the company of a leashed animal (the cat), which is, in this case, his pet.

Given the question: Information:  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico.  - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida. It includes the populous Miami metropolitan area, the Florida Keys, and other localities. South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors. When the term was originally used in the 1880s it described a building of 10 to 20 floors but now describes one of at least 40-50 floors. Mostly designed for office, commercial and residential uses a skyscraper can also be called a high-rise, but the term skyscraper is often used for buildings higher than .

Help as much as you can. Question: Information:  - Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Previously considered a subfamily of the gulls, Laridae, they are now usually given full family status and divided into eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.  - Genovesa Island , named after the Italian city of Genoa , in honor of Christopher Columbus , ( referred to in English as Tower Island ) is a shield volcano in the Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean . The island occupies about 14 square kilometres ( 5 sq mi ) , and its maximum elevation is 64 m ( 210 ft ) . The horse - shoe shaped island has a volcanic caldera whose wall has collapsed , forming the Great Darwin Bay , surrounded by cliffs . Lake Arcturus , filled with salt water , lies in the centre , and sediment within this crater lake is less than 6,000 years old . Although no historical eruptions are known from Genovesa , there are very young lava flows on the flanks of the volcano .  - A maar is a broad, low-relief volcanic crater caused by a phreatomagmatic eruption (an explosion which occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A maar characteristically fills with water to form a relatively shallow crater lake which may also be called a maar. The name comes from a Moselle Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany. Maars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in size from across and from deep; most maars commonly fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - A sinkhole, also known as a cenote, sink, sink-hole, shakehole, swallet, swallow hole, or doline (the different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably), is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer. Most are caused by karst processesfor example, the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffosion processes. Sinkholes vary in size from both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. Sinkholes may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Bárðarbunga, Bardarbunga (Anglophone spelling), is a stratovolcano located under Vatnajökull, Iceland's most extensive glacier. The second highest mountain in Iceland, above sea level, Bárðarbunga is also part of a volcanic system that is approximately long and wide. Description. Bárðarbunga is a subglacial stratovolcano located under the ice cap of Vatnajökull glacier within the Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland. It rises to above sea level, making it the second highest mountain in Iceland, about lower than Hvannadalshnjúkur. The caldera is about 80 square kilometres, up to 10 km wide and about deep. The surrounding edges rise up to 1,850 metres but the base is on average close to 1,100 metres. The volcano is covered in ice to a depth of 850m, hiding the glacier-filled crater. The associated volcanic system and fissure swarm is about 190 km long and 25 km wide.  - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - The Galápagos Islands (official name: \\"Archipiélago de Colón\\", other Spanish name: \\"Islas Galápagos\\") are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the Equator in the Pacific Ocean surrounding the centre of the Western Hemisphere, west of continental Ecuador, of which they are a part. The islands are known for their vast number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the \\"Beagle\\", as his observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.  - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\".   - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - A crater lake is a lake that forms in a volcanic crater or caldera, such as a maar; less commonly and with lower association to the term a lake may form in an impact crater caused by a meteorite, or in an artificial explosion caused by humans. Sometimes lakes which form inside calderas are called caldera lakes, but often this distinction is not made. Crater lakes covering active (fumarolic) volcanic vents are sometimes known as volcanic lakes, and the water within them is often acidic, saturated with volcanic gases, and cloudy with a strong greenish color. For example, the crater lake of Kawah Ijen in Indonesia has a pH of under 0.5. Lakes located in dormant or extinct volcanoes tend to have fresh water, and the water clarity in such lakes can be exceptional due to the lack of inflowing streams and sediment.  - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.  - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

Prank calls are a great way to create hilarious memories with your friends. Just make sure you don’t call anyone that will be offended by your prank call. You should only call people who will appreciate the humor since it’s all in good fun.  Try calling someone and asking someone if their refrigerator is running. When they say yes, tell them that they better go catch it! You could also make prank calls using the cell phone of a person who already fell asleep at your sleepover. Just make sure you don’t do anything that could get them in trouble. Pranks that scare someone for a moment can be hilarious. But be careful to keep the joke lighthearted. You want the people that you prank to be able to realize it is a joke right away, rather than being legitimately scared. For example, you could try one of these pranks:  Put makeup on your face to make yourself look like an insane clown. Then wake up your friends! Hide in the shower behind the shower curtain and pop out when someone comes in to use the bathroom. Just make sure to do it before they start using the bathroom to avoid any awkwardness. Sometimes people do funny things in their sleep and it can be really funny to record it or to talk about it the next morning. But, even if no one does anything funny in their sleep, you can always pretend they did as another prank!  Tell someone they said funny stuff in their sleep. For example, you could tell your friend that while he was sleeping he said, \\"I love the lunch-lady\\". If someone is a terrible sleep talker, record the funny things they say.","output":"The article suggests various prank ideas to keep friends entertained and create hilarious memories.

Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred   monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups.

Write a summary based on this article: * Vote is a boost to right-wing Swiss People's Party      * Likely to damage Swiss image      By Sam Cage      ZURICH, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A Swiss vote to ban the construction of new minarets puts the spotlight on the Alpine country's social and political divisions and could herald a new surge in populist, anti-immigrant sentiment.      The unexpected vote and high turnout in Sunday's referendum gives a boost to the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party (SVP), a relatively new political force that has shaken up the country's traditionally cosy power-sharing system. [ID:nGEE5AS05E]      \\"It could well be the beginnings of a new right-wing surge,\\" said Clive Church, a Swiss politics expert from Kent University.      The SVP, which has grown rapidly since the 1980s to become Switzerland's largest party, has been accused of racism for its strident anti-immigration campaigns, including a poster showing a white sheep kicking black sheep off a Swiss flag. It campaigned against extending the right of European Union citizens to live and work in non-EU member Switzerland, which voters approved in February despite SVP posters of three long-beaked sinister-looking ravens picking at a small map of Switzerland. [ID:nL7312972]      The SVP won the largest share of the vote in a 2007 general election but its fortunes have since faded: a faction split off to form another party, at one point it lost all its cabinet seats and it has had little success in referenda. Until now.      The SVP poster for Sunday's vote featured a Swiss flag covered in missile-like minarets and the portrait of a woman covered with a black chador and veil, associated with strict Islam, continuing the line of provocative election literature.      While Switzerland's Muslim community of some 300,000 is relatively small there is wider concern about immigration in a country where foreigners make up more than a fifth of the total 7.7 million population.      Nationwide voter turnout was about 53 percent, higher than a more usual 35 to 45 percent, and 22 of 26 cantons, or provinces, voted in favour of the initiative. The decision went against recent polls, which had indicated a slim majority opposed a ban.      There was marked division between urban areas like Zurich and French-speaking areas -- which are traditionally more liberal -- and rural, German speaking cantons like Schaffhausen, where some 70 percent of voters supported the initiative.      \\"It represents a two finger gesture against the towns, foreigners, the powerful, the better educated and the like. The pattern of voting confirms that,\\" said Swiss culture and politics expert Jonathan Steinberg of the University of Pennsylvania.      IDENTITY CRISIS      Switzerland has suffered an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War robbed its neutrality of much meaning, helping fuel the rise of the SVP. Continued... ||||| ZURICH -- Muslim leaders from around the world condemned a vote in Switzerland to ban the construction of minarets in the Alpine country, raising fresh fears of a backlash against Swiss interests around the world.      Voters in Switzerland approved a referendum Sunday to ban the building of new minarets on mosques. Nearly 58% of voters, and all but four of the country's 26 cantons, supported the initiative, with support for the ban reaching 70% in some regions.      Banning Minarets in Switzerland View Slideshow Urs Flueeler/Associated Press A poster of the conservative initiative was spray-painted with a peace sign and a sticker reading \\"thank you\\" in the village of Amsteg. The European Court of Human Rights could strike down Sunday's vote, which incurred swift condemnation in Switzerland and abroad. More photos and interactive graphics      The outcome was a surprise in a country that has had far fewer problems with the integration of its Muslim minority than its European neighbors. As a result, the government braced for a possible backlash against Swiss businesses, even as companies themselves took a low-key response to the outcome, hoping not to stir tension.      Political and religious leaders of Muslim countries were quick to condemn the vote. Maskuri Abdillah, head of Indonesia's biggest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama, said the vote reflected \\"a hatred of Swiss people against Muslim communities.\\"      Egypt's top cleric, Ali Gomaa, called the referendum an \\"insult\\" to Muslims, while the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the largest international Muslim group with 57 member states, called the vote a \\"recent example of growing anti-Islamic incitements in Europe by extremist, anti-immigrant, xenophobic, racist, scare-mongering ultraright politicians who reign over common sense, wisdom and universal values.\\"      \\"It is a bad answer to a bad question,\\" Babacar Ba, the Geneva ambassador of the Islamic conference told Swiss journalists Monday. \\"I fear that this kind of thing is simply a gift to extremism and intolerance.\\"      The Swiss foreign ministry began Monday to try to ease tensions with the Muslim world. Top diplomats in Bern have contacted leaders of Islamic organizations, including the Islamic conference. Swiss diplomats in Muslim countries also have reached out to local foreign ministries to assure governments that the referendum doesn't restrict the right of Muslims in Switzerland to practice their religion.      Despite the rhetoric, there were no reports Monday of incidents against Swiss interests. The Swiss government, which waged an aggressive campaign against the initiative, has feared a backlash similar to that suffered by Denmark several years ago after the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, when consumers boycotted Danish goods and protesters attacked Danish embassies in some countries.      In the run-up to the Swiss referendum, the government studied the Danish leadership's reaction to that incident to prepare for a possible yes vote. As a result, Swiss diplomats in recent months have worked to calm concerns in Muslim countries about the initiative.      On Monday, Swiss companies kept a low profile in the wake of the vote, declining to discuss any possible retaliation while urging the government to work to calm tensions.      A number of Swiss companies, such as engineering group ABB Ltd. and food maker Nestlé SA, have large interests in Muslim countries. Nestlé has about 50 factories in the Muslim world and is the world's largest producer of halal food, or food permissible under Islamic law. Nestlé has recently begun expanding its halal business in Europe, to cater to the Continent's growing Muslim population. \\"Nestlé cannot be associated with any form of discrimination,\\" the company said.      Switzerland's main employer's association, Economiesuisse, called for the government to \\"limit the potential damage\\" by keeping a dialogue open with Muslim leaders.      At a business conference in Zurich, Hans-Ulrich Meister, head of Switzerland for Credit Suisse Group, played down concerns. Clients in the Muslim countries \\"typically are huge investors and very professional,\\" he said. \\"They can differentiate between direct democracy banning minarets and religious freedom, but the political bodies in Switzerland have to explain this.\\"      Nonetheless, the government suggested Swiss business could suffer somewhat as a result of the vote. \\"I am assuming our trade relations with other countries will become more difficult,\\" said Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf at a news conference.      —Summer Said and Katharina Bart contributed to this article.

A:","output":"Based on the given information, let me analyze the review and provide a detailed explanation of whether it portrays the product in a flattering or unflattering light. The title of the review indicates that it is about a \\"Horror story,\\" which could be interpreted as either a book or the reviewer's experience of the entire purchasing process. However, there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review. Let's first look at the positive aspect: - \\"The book was all that it was supposed to be\\" - This statement suggests that the reviewer is satisfied with the content and quality of the book. It implies that the book met their expectations, possibly regarding its storyline, characters, and the author's writing style. This part of the review casts the product (the book) in a flattering light, as it reflects the reviewer's satisfaction with the product itself. However, there are some negative aspects in the review as well: - The reviewer mentions that the book \\"didn't come when it was supposed to,\\" which indicates that there might have been a delay in the delivery of the product. This can be seen as an unflattering aspect for the product, but it is essential to note that this issue might not necessarily be tied to the product itself. Instead, it could be related to the shipping or delivery service employed. - Additionally, the reviewer states that the book \\"had to be shipped to my second address,\\" again pointing out another issue with the delivery process. Similar to the previous negative aspect, this issue might not directly reflect the product itself but rather the performance of the shipping or handling services utilized. In summary, this review portrays the product in both a flattering and unflattering light. However, it is essential to differentiate between the product and the services provided by external parties. The book, as a product, is depicted in a flattering light, as the reviewer has expressed satisfaction with its content and quality. However, the unflattering references in the review highlight issues related to the shipping and delivery processes rather than the novel itself. Therefore, the unflattering aspects would not tarnish the book's reputation but could negatively impact the customer's overall experience and perception of the seller or the delivery service."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Lib Dems favour a cheaper option, with a study on possible alternatives due to be published in the summer. Labour says it would consider different options for the future if they provided better value for money while retaining for the UK a \\"credible\\" deterrent. Q&A: Trident replacement If it did so it would mean a break with past Labour policy - the then Prime Minister Tony Blair committed the party to a like-for-like replacement in 2006. Trident is a sea-based nuclear weapons system, acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s. It has three parts - submarines, missiles and warheads, and although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely. The current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the 2020s. In 2007 MPs backed by 409 to 61 for \\"conceptual\\" work to begin on a replacement system, and the go-ahead for the Â£3bn procurement of important items began after the 2010 election. But the coalition government also decided to delay the ultimate decision on whether to proceed and how many submarines to order until 2016, after the expected date of the next election. The Financial Times quotes one of Labour leader Ed Miliband's advisers as saying: \\"We just want to put it in the bag of money saving measures we are advocating to show we are serious about deficit reductions.\\" A Labour spokesman told the BBC that the party would look at the outcome of the government's report on possible alternatives to Trident before reaching a decision. He said the party remained \\"committed to retaining an independent nuclear deterrent\\" but would be looking at \\"value for money\\" if the report does come up with a viable alternative. Possible alternatives include ending the requirement to have nuclear weapons on submarines at sea round-the-clock, or using different submarines and cruise missiles.","output":"So, there are three big teams called Conservatives, Lib Dems, and Labour.
