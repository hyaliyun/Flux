(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When the final closing arguments in a murder trial have been presented to the judge, she gives her instructions to the jury, all of whom are men. In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one...

Dust devils on Mars can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes, with a funnel more than 330ft (100 metres) wide stretching up to 12 miles (19km) above the surface. Their smaller counterparts on Earth form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air above. Now, a new study has found that it's not just their size that sets Martian dust devils apart; they also require a stronger updraft create a similar vortex than on Earth. Spinning a dust devil in the thin air of Mars requires a stronger updraft than is needed to create a similar vortex on Earth, researchers claim. Pictured is a dust devil reaching above the plain of Mars' Amazonis Planitia. The discovery could help scientists analyse how dust affects the Martian weather system - a piece of information that will impact deep space missions to the red planet. 'To start a dust devil on Mars you need convection, a strong updraft,' said Bryce Williams, an atmospheric science graduate student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). 'We looked at the ratio between convection and surface turbulence to find the sweet spot where there is enough updraft to overcome the low level wind and turbulence. 'And on Mars, where we think the process that creates a vortex is more easily disrupted by frictional dissipation – turbulence and wind at the surface – you need twice as much convective updraft as you do on Earth.' Dust devils on Mars can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes, with a funnel more than 330ft (100 metres) wide stretching as much as 12 miles (19km) above the surface (left). Their smaller counterparts on Earth form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air (right) Dust devils and tornadoes are common on Mars. Here they have lifted the thin bright dust on the surface of the Schiaparelli Basin, exposing darker material underneath. The team looked for the dust devil sweet spot by combining data from a study of Australian dust devils with meteorological observations collected during the Viking Lander mission. They are now looking at the effects dust devils have on lifting dust into the Martian atmosphere, and changing the planet's climate. 'The Martian air is so thin, dust has a greater effect on energy transfers in the atmosphere and on the surface than it does in Earth's thick atmosphere,' said Professor Udaysankar Nair. Dust in the Martian air cools the surface during the day and emits long-wave radiation that warms the surface at night. Nasa scientists in California have revealed evidence that suggests there is life on Mars based on readings taken by the Curiosity rover (shown). They said methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria. And at the moment there is no alternative explanation for the spikes. In the past few months, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, but one greater question remains: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well? Scientists may be on the brink of answering that question with an equally conclusive 'yes', as convincing evidence has been detected by Nasa's Curiosity rover. An instrument on the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface - and it could be the first alien life ever detected. 'This temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localiSed source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden 'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. While spotting dust devil tracks is relatively common, catching these whirling dervishes on the Martian surface can be tough. Earlier this year, observations from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter caught three dust devils in action. Despite their reputation, they can actually help solar panelled robots on the Martian surface. For instance, the Mars Rover Opportunity underwent a 'cleaning event' this year, when a dust devil blew off material stuck to its surface. Earlier this year, observations from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter caught three dust devils in action. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A new study reveals that dust devils on Mars require a stronger updraft to create a vortex than on Earth due to the thin Martian atmosphere.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The geography of New York City is characterized by its coastal position at the meeting of the the Atlantic Ocean and a river that is how many miles long? The answer is:","output":"New York City, often regarded as the epitome of urban landscapes, demonstrates unique geographical characteristics due to its coastal position where the Atlantic Ocean meets a noteworthy river. Crucial to understanding New York City's geography is the Hudson River, which plays a significant role in shaping the city's development and environment. Stretching approximately 315 miles (507 kilometers) in length, the Hudson River begins in the Adirondack Mountains at Lake Tear of the Clouds, coursing through eastern New York State, and reaching its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean between Battery Park in Manhattan and Liberty Island. The nature of this lengthy river has been instrumental in determining New York City's topography, climate, and ecosystem, thereby directly influencing both the city's design and function. New York City is located at a strategic juncture where the Hudson River flows into the Upper New York Bay or the New York Harbor, a broad, complex estuary system that enhances commerce, trade, and transportation capabilities. Over time, the city experienced an increase in maritime traffic, becoming a critical hub for international trade and industry in the United States. The formation of the five boroughs of New York City – Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island – can also be partially attributed to the Hudson River's geographical influence. Besides its centrality to New York City's geography, the Hudson River has environmental implications, supporting the convergence of freshwater and saltwater species. The Hudson River Estuary is home to over 200 species of fish and a diverse array of birds, mammals, and plants. The river plays an important role in migration and breeding habitats, providing vital ecological benefits to the surrounding area. Additionally, the Hudson River Valley boasts bountiful agricultural lands and picturesque landscapes, attracting both residents and tourists alike. The river has inspired generations of artists, writers, and architects, leading to the Hudson River School's establishment, a mid-19th-century American art movement that celebrated the beauty and power of nature. In conclusion, New York City's geography is significantly characterized by its coastal position at the meeting point of the Atlantic Ocean and the approximately 315-mile (507-kilometer) long Hudson River. This unique location has not only molded the city's development and infrastructure but also shaped its prosperous maritime trade, diverse ecosystems, and rich culture, making New York City the iconic metropolis it is today."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - The Vettones (Greek: \\"Ouettones\\") were a pre-Roman people of the Iberian Peninsula of possibly Celtic ethnicity.  - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.  - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek  (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from  (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and  (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\".  - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used.  - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.  - Castile and León (Leonese: \\"Castiella y Llión\\" ) is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the first time during the First Spanish Republic in the 19th century. León first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it permanently in 1230. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the third largest region of the European Union, covering an area of with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011).  - The Central System, Spanish and , is one of the main systems of mountain ranges in the Iberian Peninsula. 2,592 m high Pico Almanzor is its highest summit.   - The Sierra de Gredos is a mountain range in central Spain that spans the provinces of Ávila, Salamanca, Cáceres, Madrid, and Toledo. It is part of the much larger Central System of mountain ranges. Its highest point is Pico Almanzor, at 2,592 metres and it has been declared a natural park by the Autonomous Community of Castile and León. The Sierra de Gredos is one of the most extensive mountain ranges of the Central System; it comprises five river valleys: the Alto Tormes, the Alto Alberche, the Tiétar Oriental, the Tiétar Occidental y la Vera, and the Valle del Ambroz. The first known inhabitants were the Vettones, a pre-Roman Celtic people. The central part of the range encomprises the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park.  - The Circo de Gredos is a glacial cirque situated in the central part of the northern slope of the Sierra de Gredos ( the main range in the Sistema Central mountains in central Spain ) . It is one of the most important areas in the Parque Regional de la Sierra de Gredos . It is the most significant glacial cirque of the Sierra de Gredos , and of the entire Sistema Central , approximately 33 hectares ( 330,000 square meters ) in area . At the East edge of the cirque is the summit Pico Almanzor , the highest of the range at 2,592 meters . At the North - East edge , the bottom of the cirque , there is the Laguna Grande de Gredos at a height of 1,940 metres . Next to this lake is the mountain refuge Elola , much frequented by mountaineers who intend to climb Pico Almanzor . The cirque is within the basin of the river Tormes , a tributary of the river Duero . It is part of the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park . There is a route that leads to the cirque which is very busy with tourists and mountaineers , particularly in the summer . This path starts from parking that is known as the Plataforma de Gredos at 1,770 meters . The well defined route climbs South - West from here , and then across a grassy boggy moor to arrive at the Barrerones ( 2,210 metres ) . From here , the path descends south until reaching the Laguna Grande ( or great lake ) de Gredos , and the refuge Elola .  - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger.  - Pico Almanzor is the highest mountain in central Spain.

Q: CONTEXT: Minas  Ambos bandos se verían envueltos en grandes competiciones de minados y contraminados. La tierra seca del Somme estaba especialmente preparada para la construcción de zapas. Sin embargo, con la ayuda de los explosivos era también posible excavar en terrenos como Flandes. Habían compañías especializadas en tunelados, normalmente formadas por personas que tenían experiencia civil como mineros de carbón, que construían túneles dentro de la tierra de nadie y debajo de las trincheras enemigas. Estas minas se rellenaban entonces de explosivos y eran detonadas, produciendo un gran cráter. Con ello se perseguían dos propósitos: destruir la trinchera enemiga y, gracias al montículo que producía alrededor del cráter, servir como \\"trinchera\\" cercana a la línea enemiga. Por ello, cuando se detonaba una mina, los dos bandos corrían para ocupar y fortificar el cráter. ANSWER: un gran cráter A:","output":"¿Cuál era la finalidad de utilizar explosivos para excavar túneles debajo de las trincheras enemigas y luego detonarlos, y cómo aprovechaban ambos bandos el gran cráter resultante en la guerra de trincheras?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title: NEW YORK, USA (AFP) - Delta Air Lines announced an aggressive restructuring plan yesterday that would cut 6,000 to 7,000 jobs and slash costs, while warning that bankruptcy remains  quot;a real possibility quot;.","output":"Title: \\"Delta Air Lines Unveils Major Restructuring Plan: Job Cuts, Cost Reductions, and Bankruptcy Warnings\\" The American airline giant, Delta Air Lines, revealed an ambitious restructuring plan yesterday, outlining a series of measures aimed at addressing its financial challenges. The announcement comes amidst turbulent times for the airline industry, with the ongoing pandemic continuing to negatively impact demand for air travel. Delta's management acknowledged that bankruptcy remains a very real possibility, should the proposed measures fail to bear fruit. The restructuring plan includes cutting between 6,000 to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, as a means to align operational overheads with expected market demands. The move is expected to affect employees across various departments and organizational levels. These measures are intended to help the company become leaner and more agile, in response to the rapidly changing landscape of commercial aviation. The airline industry has been particularly hard hit, as more people opt for virtual meetings, cancel vacations, and avoid non-essential travel due to the ongoing pandemic. In addition to the workforce reductions, Delta aims to lower operational costs significantly. These measures will include reviewing and renegotiating current contracts with suppliers, and reevaluating the company's fleet plans. The airline may opt to defer or cancel orders for new aircraft and accelerate the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient planes. In combination with the employment cuts, this approach is anticipated to lead to annualized cost savings of 2.1 to 2.3 billion. In a statement made to the press, Delta's management emphasized the importance of these initiatives in securing the company's future. They admitted that, despite receiving billions of dollars in government aid over the past year, the possibility of declaring bankruptcy had not been completely averted. Indeed, other major airlines around the world have succumbed to insolvency or sought bankruptcy protection to weather the storm, suggesting that Delta's concerns are well-founded. Industry experts are closely watching Delta's restructuring efforts, as they may serve as a blueprint for other airlines grappling with similar challenges. While some analysts believe that the proposed measures may be sufficient to help Delta avoid bankruptcy, others argue that a full recovery for the airline can only be achieved once widespread vaccination efforts have eradicated the pandemic and restored consumer confidence. In conclusion, Delta Air Lines' restructuring plan, consisting of significant job cuts and aggressive cost reductions, aims to strengthen the company's financial position and avert potential bankruptcy. The success of these measures will not only impact thousands of employees and customers but may also indicate the path forward for an industry in desperate need of stability and growth. Only time will tell whether Delta's bold initiative will be enough to help it overcome the unparalleled challenges it currently faces."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

Here is an article: The UK has sought advice from Canada on how to secure a trade agreement with the EU following the Brexit vote, the Canadian trade minister has said. Chrystia Freeland told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that her team had been having “technical exchanges” with Britain about Canada’s recently finalised deal with the EU. She was speaking before a meeting with Liam Fox, the UK’s secretary of state for international trade. “As members of the Commonwealth they agreed to build a stronger, closer relationship in a number of areas including trade and prosperity,” a spokesperson for the new department said. “The ministers expressed a wish to work together better to promote the opportunities and benefits of globalisation and to think about how to get more SMEs exporting.” On Thursday, David Davis, the minister for Brexit, said his preferred model for the UK’s continuing relationship with the EU is Canada’s comprehensive and economic trade agreement (Ceta). Speaking on Friday, Freeland said: “We have been sharing, at a technical level, details of how Ceta works.” However, she said securing such deals was “very, very complicated. There are 300 trade negotiators in Canada. It takes a big expert team to negotiate trade agreements.” The UK does not have the expertise to negotiate trade deals, as for decades agreements have been conducted at EU level. Whitehall is scouring business, the European commission, and friendly countries including Canada for trade specialists to help lead talks. The government has said it plans to hire up to 300 staff to try to address a shortage of trade negotiators capable of forging closer economic ties to dozens of other countries. Oliver Letwin, who was going to run the Brexit unit before losing his role in Theresa May’s cabinet overhaul, told the BBC: “We don’t have trade negotiators because the trade negotiation has been going on in the EU so we are going to have to hire a whole – David Davis is going to have to hire – group to deal with the EU negotiations, and Liam Fox, of course, in what I think is an excellent plan of Theresa’s to create a new Department of International Trade.” Related: Global trade deals will be bigger outside than in the EU, says David Davis Gregor Irwin, chief economist at the Global Counsel consultancy and a former chief economist at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said the government had people who understood trade policy, but did not have negotiators. “No doubt people will have to be brought in from outside. They will look to get people wherever they can find them, and Canada and New Zealand would be good places to look. This is a huge agenda and it’s a long process.” Davis has said that article 50, the formal process for negotiating the UK’s exit from the EU, should not be triggered until the end of the year, from when Britain would have two years to negotiate its trading terms with the 27-nation bloc. Canada took seven years to finalise its deal with the EU and it is not expected to be implemented until 2017. A top US trade official said on Thursday that he had held preliminary discussions with British officials about how the two countries could pursue bilateral trade relations post Brexit. Freeland said Canada had secured a “gold standard” deal with the EU. However, she made clear that while it had secured “ambitious services agreements”, it would not enjoy the same level of “passporting” that the UK currently has as a member state – a status that enables banks and financial services businesses to trade freely. The Canadian deal also does not offer the same level of freedom of movement for professionals as that within EU member states. While the control of borders and worker movement is something Brexiters have argued for, Freeland said: “Canada’s position is to be ambitious in mobility. We think that facilitates trade.” Write a title for it.","output":"UK Seeks Canadian Advice on Securing Post-Brexit EU Trade Agreement"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

When people see an object, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a meaningful arrangement of semantic parts. Moreover, when people refer to an object, they provide descriptions that are not merely true but also relevant in the current context. Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities. We further show that a neural speaker that is \`listener-aware' --- that plans its utterances according to how an imagined listener would interpret its words in context --- produces more discriminative referring expressions than an \`listener-unaware' speaker, as measured by human performance in identifying the correct object.

By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W.

If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.  I am facing a new situation today: Phyllis and Meredith have the exact same diet and are both going to see a dietician for suggestions about what they should eat. Phyllis is currently five months pregnant and wants to see if she should do anything differently in regards to her food consumption. Meredith is not pregnant, but still wants to go to see if her diet is acceptable.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which woman's diet will most likely include more red meat? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article, it is likely that Phyllis' diet will most likely include more red meat compared to Meredith's diet. The reason for this is that pregnant women, such as Phyllis, have a higher daily requirement of iron (27 mg) in order to support the increased demand for this important nutrient during pregnancy. Red meat, such as beef, is a good source of dietary iron, as mentioned in the background article. On the other hand, Meredith, who is not pregnant, would have lower iron requirements based on her age group; if she is in the 14 to 18 years age range, she would need 15 mg of iron daily, whereas if she is older than 18, her requirements would be in the range of 8 to 18 mg depending on her specific nutritional needs. In order to meet Phyllis' increased iron requirements during her pregnancy, the dietician would likely recommend that she consume more iron-rich foods, such as red meat, shellfish, seeds, nuts, legumes, and fortified breakfast cereals. By doing so, Phyllis can help ensure that she is providing enough iron for both her own health and the healthy development of her baby. Therefore, considering the fact that pregnant women have a higher daily iron requirement, it can be expected that Phyllis' diet will include more red meat compared to Meredith's diet. However, it is essential for both Phyllis and Meredith to consult with their respective dietician to receive personalized dietary advice tailored to their individual needs and health status."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also, choose something that adds to the artwork’s meaning, not something completely random that doesn’t mean anything.  There shouldn’t be copyright issues with this approach unless you are using a lengthy quote. If you have just a few words from a poem or book and you are appropriating it in a new way, this would likely be protected by fair use guidelines.  Pam Farrell titled her painting, “Seasick Sailor,” which were words that she heard in song by both Beck and Bob Dylan. David White used titles of books and movies such as “The Man Who Knew Too Much” and “The Man Who Would Be King” and repurposed them into titles for a series of paintings. One of his paintings is, “The Man Who Was Tired of Perpetual War,” naming the action after the character in his painting. Talk with family, friends, or other artists to get suggestions on a good title. They may have some interesting or inspirational ideas that you hadn’t thought of.  Alternately, throw a “titling party” with other artists or friends. Throw a party and display the artwork. Ask everyone to give suggestions for a title. Some titling parties demand that all guests stay until suggestions are made and a title is chosen. Painter Jackson Pollock would often only number his paintings, such as “Number 27, 1950,” but the art critic Clement Greenberg would give the paintings poetic names, such as “Lavender Mist” or “Alchemy,” in order to differentiate among them. If your artwork or artistic style is particularly influenced by a certain piece of art or artist, you could consider naming your work after that. Paying homage to your influences can be a good source for artwork titles. Andy Warhol created a series of pop culture-infused paintings called, “The Last Supper,” as reinterpretations of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” Observe how other artists name their works of art. Read the story behind why a particular artwork was given its name. Read titles for different types of artwork, from classical paintings and modern drawings to sculptures and video art.

Input: Entity 1: throat   Entity 2: saliva pooling Output:","output":"Step 1: Understand the relationship between the two entities To determine if the second entity is a part of the first entity, we need to understand the relationship between throat and saliva pooling. Step 2: Analyze the context of the entities Throat refers to the part of the body that connects the mouth to the windpipe and esophagus. Saliva pooling, on the other hand, refers to the accumulation of saliva, a fluid secreted by salivary glands, in the mouth or throat. Step 3: Identify the part-of relationship, if any In this case, saliva pooling can occur in the throat. However, saliva pooling itself is not a part of the throat's structure, but rather a process that can take place within it. Step 4: Classify the relationship Since saliva pooling is not a structural part of the throat, the relationship between these two entities would not be classified as meronymy.

Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the flight managed to land safely at its destination. The gun, which was part of the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program, was in the possession of the pilot as a measure of security on board the aircraft. The program was designed as a response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, allowing authorized pilots to carry firearms as a line of defense against potential in-flight threats.  As the aircraft cruised at its assigned altitude, the pilot's gun accidentally discharged after a suspected malfunction. The gunshot reportedly resulted in minor damage to the cabin area but did not jeopardize the flight's overall safety. Passengers were notified of the incident, and the crew remained calm, ensuring everyone's well-being. Airport authorities were informed about the accidental discharge immediately, and measures were in place to assess the situation upon the flight's arrival. Officials from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Air Marshal Service were on hand to investigate the cause of the incident and ensure that future occurrences can be prevented. A thorough examination of the weapon is currently underway to determine the root cause of the accident. The pilot in question, who has not been named, is cooperating with the investigation and will undergo a review of his training and qualifications in light of the event. US Airways and the FFDO program have emphasized the importance of strict protocols and safety measures when handling firearms on board aircraft. This incident serves as a reminder that even with all the necessary precautions in place, unforeseen mishaps can occur. Despite the alarming nature of this incident, passengers and crew members can take comfort in the fact that no one was hurt, and the flight arrived safely at its destination. Amid ongoing investigations, US Airways remains committed to maintaining the highest levels of safety and security for all its passengers and crew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: From what Old English dialect did Scots derive? Is \\"It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of Somerset.\\" the correct answer?","output":"No, the statement about the dialect of Somerset does not answer the question about the Old English dialect from which Scots derived. While it is true that the Somerset dialect preserved aspects of the West Saxon dialect of Old English, it is not directly related to the origin of the Scots language.  Scots originated from the Old English dialect known as Northumbrian, or more specifically, the Northern dialect of Old English. Northumbrian was spoken in the kingdom of Northumbria, which encompassed present-day northeastern England and southeastern Scotland. After the Anglo-Saxon migration and during the 5th and 6th centuries, the Germanic peoples of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes brought their own dialects to the area that would become England. The different Old English dialects were influenced by these groups, with the Northumbrian dialect being greatly influenced by the Angles.  The development of Scots can be traced back to the later part of Northumbria's history when the kingdom was invaded and partitioned by the Vikings in the 9th century. This led to a linguistic divide, with the southern part of Northumbria retaining a more English character, and the northern part, which included the Scottish Lowlands, acquiring a more \\"Scots\\" character. As Scotland emerged as a separate kingdom, the Northumbrian dialect spoken in the southeastern region of modern-day Scotland began to evolve and develop its own characteristics, distinct from the other dialects spoken in England. By the mid- to late 14th century, the language in Scotland had become distinct enough to be considered a separate language, known as Scots. The Middle Scots period (around the 15th and 16th centuries) saw further development and the use of the Scots language in various literary works, legal and administrative documents, and even as the language of the Royal Court. However, following the union of the Scottish and English crowns in 1603 and the eventual creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the Scots language began to lose ground to Standard English, particularly in official and literary contexts. While the linguistic history of Scots can be traced back to the Northumbrian dialect of Old English, it is important to note that Scots also evolved under the influence of other languages and dialects. The Old Norse language spoken by Norse settlers in northern Scotland and Gaelic, which was spoken in other parts of Scotland, also impacted the development of Scots over time. In conclusion, Scots derived from the Northumbrian (Northern) dialect of Old English, and its development has been influenced by various factors, including geographical, historical, and linguistic elements—differentiating it from other Old English dialects and leading to the emergence of a distinct language spoken in Scotland."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Since 1 km = 1000 meters, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds, we can convert 40 km/hr to m/s by multiplying with the appropriate conversion factors: Speed = 40 km/hr * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = (40*1000)/(3600) m/s  Speed = 40000/3600 m/s ≈ 11.11 m/s Step 2: Calculate the length of the train. We know that speed = distance/time, so we can rearrange the equation to find the distance (length of the train) by multiplying speed by time: Length of the train = Speed * Time Length of the train = 11.11 m/s * 25.2 s  Length of the train ≈ 280.08 meters Step 3: Match the calculated length with the given options.

In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, from north London, claims she did not know where the money came from when she agreed to carry €20,000 to Istanbul. A young British student accused of smuggling cash in her knickers to fund jihadists fighting in Syria today said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend. Nawal Msaad, 27, was caught with the stash of €20,000, the equivalent of £15,830, in rolled up notes as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow, jurors have heard. The Old Bailey was earlier told she agreed to be a 'trusted courier' for her close friend Amal El Wahabi, also 27. The money was to be taken to Turkey at the request of El Wahabi’s husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria, the court heard. But she was stopped by police after the cash - which had been hidden inside her in a condom - fell out into her pants. Taking to the witness box at the Old Bailey in tight light pink trousers, a white sleeveless shirt and pink strappy high heel shoes, Msaad insisted she had never meant to smuggle cash abroad to bankroll terrorism. And she accused her friend and co-defendant El Wahabi of 'stitching' her up by not telling her where the money had come from. Her defence barrister Naeem Mian asked her: 'It was put to you that in effect you have been stitched up by her, what do you say to that?' Msaad said: 'Well, she wasn’t completely honest with me about where the money came from. And so I do get that feeling, I’m not going to deny that - the feeling that I have been stitched up.' Msaad, of Holloway, north London, and El Wahabi, of north west London, both deny funding terrorism. Msaad, who was born and raised in London and studying human resource management at London Metropolitan University in Aldgate, said she has known her friend since their school days at Holland Park School. She admitted having a 'soft spot' for her friend, but said they are not very close. And she vehemently denied ever trying to smuggle cash to extremists fighting in Syria, which is in the midst of a bloody civil war. Speaking so softly that the judge had to repeatedly ask her to keep her voice up, she flatly denied the charge against her. Mr Mian asked her: 'Between 13 and 16 of January 2014 were you concerned in an arrangement to make money available for the purposes of terrorism?' She replied: 'No'. He added: 'Did you suspect that the €20,000 given to you by El Wahabi may have been for the purposes of terrorism?' She again replied: 'No'. Her barrister said: 'Were you ever told or did you ever suspect that Aine Davis, otherwise known as Hamza, was or may be involved in terrorism.' She replied: 'No' and also said she had no idea the cash might have come from drug dealing and crime. She added: 'I had no intention to smuggle money into Turkey.' On January 16 this year Msaad set off for Heathrow airport for the three-day trip but when she approached the departure gate she was stopped by police. She said she was going for a 'short break', was buying gold for her mother and had €20,000 'around me'. She was later arrested. Davis allegedly left London in July last year to pursue the jihadist cause but had maintained regular contact with his wife, with whom he has two young sons. The 30-year-old, who was also born in London with roots in Gambia, converted to Islam six or seven years ago, it is alleged. Accusation: Msaad (left) claims she thought the €20,000 was for her school friend and co-defendant Amal El Wahabi (right) to start a new life abroad with her husband and children. Msaad was arrested at Heathrow. Msaad said El Wahabi originally said she had a job for her and that she would be paid €1,000 if she did it. She told jurors she was 'curious' and originally thought it might be a hairdressing job. El Wahabi texted her friend and said 'I asked you because I trust you' but later said she 'can’t explain' the job by phone, the court heard. But El Wahabi later told her it was to courier around €10,000 (£7,900) or 'maybe more' to her husband who she was going to travel abroad to live with, along with their two children. Msaad said she believed the cash was for a new house as the family were setting up home abroad. She later had a phone call with Davis on January 13 who asked her to bring €20,000 (£15,800) over. Msaad told the court: 'I asked \\"how much?\\" He said 20 bags - a bag is €1,000 in slang.' Asked if she had any concerns about travelling with such a large amount of cash on her, she said: 'It is a lot of money, it’s a big responsibility. 'I just didn’t want to lose their money. I was a bit worried.' But she insisted she didn’t think she was doing anything illegal. Denial: Msaad spoke at the Old Bailey to deny funding terrorism and said she has never held extremist views. She said: 'I asked him \\"Are you allowed to bring that amount of money over?\\" 'The way he sounded was really reassuring. He said \\"It’s fine, you can bring that amount of money\\", I had no reason to doubt him.' She admitted she had never asked where the cash came from, but thought it to be Davis’ savings. Msaad, whose family come from Morocco, said she is a Muslim who prays and fasts on Ramadan, but 'wouldn't say my family is particularly religious. I wouldn't call myself religious'. And she denied that she was very political or had ever viewed extremist, jihadi literature. She told the court: 'I would say I'm not more or less than the average person is interested in politics. 'However, I'm sensitive to the situations that are going on in the world, I don't turn a blind eye to anything. 'I'm sympathetic towards situations, but I don't dedicate any of my time towards politics.' The trial was adjourned until 9.30am tomorrow morning.

Msaad was caught with €20,000 in rolled-up notes as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow. The court heard that she agreed to be a \\"trusted courier\\" for her close friend Amal El Wahabi, also 27, and the money was to be taken to Turkey at the request of El Wahabi's husband, Aine Davis, who had joined fighters in Syria. Msaad insisted she had never intended to smuggle cash abroad to fund terrorism and accused her friend and co-defendant El Wahabi of not telling her where the money had come from.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To get vegetables to grow better in your garden.","output":"To get vegetables to grow better in your garden, it's essential to invest time and effort into creating an optimal environment for plants to thrive. Here are some detailed steps that you can follow to achieve better growth in your vegetable garden: 1. Choose the right location: Select an area in your garden that receives an adequate amount of sunlight, as most vegetables need at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sun exposure per day. Ideally, the site should also be close to a water source for easy irrigation and have well-draining soil. 2. Test and amend the soil: Conduct a soil test to determine the pH and nutrient levels of your garden soil. If the pH is too acidic or alkaline, amend the soil with lime or sulfur, respectively. Additionally, consider adding organic matter like compost, aged manure, or well-rotted leaves to improve soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity. 3. Plan your garden layout: Properly plan the arrangement of your vegetables, taking into account their growth habits, mature size, and sunlight requirements. Consider using crop rotation and plant diversification techniques to reduce pest and disease pressure, as well as improve soil health. 4. Choose appropriate crops: Select vegetable varieties that are suited to your region's climate and growing conditions. Consult local gardening groups, extension services, or experienced gardeners for recommendations on the best varieties for your area. 5. Optimize planting times: Ensure that you plant your vegetables at the appropriate time, taking into account factors such as soil temperature, frost dates, and the length of the growing season in your area. This will ensure that your vegetables will have enough time to mature and produce a bountiful harvest. 6. Properly space your plants: Give your vegetables enough space to grow by following recommended planting distances. This will help maximize light penetration and air circulation, while minimizing competition for nutrients, water, and sunlight. 7. Implement effective watering practices: Ensure that your vegetables receive the proper amount of water by using efficient irrigation methods like drip irrigation, soaker hoses, or hand watering at the plant base. Water deeply and consistently, but avoid overwatering as this can cause root rot and other issues. 8. Apply mulch: Applying a layer of organic mulch around your vegetable plants will help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and reduce soil erosion. Some common mulching materials include straw, grass clippings, wood chips, or leaf litter. 9. Fertilize appropriately: Provide your vegetables with the necessary nutrients by applying the right types and amounts of fertilizer based on the results of your soil test and the specific nutritional requirements of your crops. Use either organic (manure, compost, fish emulsion, etc.) or synthetic fertilizers, but always follow label instructions. 10. Pest and disease management: Monitor your garden regularly for signs of pests and diseases. Implement integrated pest management strategies such as biological controls, companion planting, and barrier methods. Use chemical controls only as a last resort, and choose organic or least-toxic options whenever possible. 11. Properly maintain your garden: Regularly weed, prune, and thin your vegetable plants as needed to maintain a healthy garden environment. Timely removal of dead or diseased plant material will help prevent the spread of diseases and pests. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to achieving better growth and a bountiful harvest from your vegetable garden. Remember that gardening is a continuous learning process, so don't be afraid to experiment and adapt your techniques based on your specific growing conditions and observations in the garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The details, first reported in Entertainment Weekly, “are cartoonish in the best (or, depending on one's taste, worst) sense of the word,” writes Ray Gustini in the Atlantic. “There are colorful sidekicks, a cadre of villains called Gangsters Imposters Racketeers Liars & Irredeemable Ex-cons (ie, GIRLIE Men), and, yes, an Arnold Cave.” Plus, “the magazine's April 1 newsstand date is the first major red flag,” Gustini notes. In the Hollywood Reporter, Scott Roxborough expresses similar doubts, but notes that Schwarzenegger had already announced plans for a new TV series, and promised to unveil details next week. But some of the other details Roxborough notes do sound awfully jokey: Schwarzenegger says the project, a collaboration with Stan Lee, is his Plan B since he can’t legally run for president … and claims he didn’t tell Maria Shriver about it in advance. Expand this summary.","output":"There has been a great deal of excitement and speculation surrounding Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the world of entertainment as the cartoon and comic book character, \\"The Governator.\\" Many people believe the announcement might be an April Fool's joke, as the details discussed seem quite cartoonish and over-the-top. These elements include comical sidekicks, an Arnold Cave, and a group of antagonists called Gangsters Imposters Racketeers Liars & Irredeemable Ex-cons (GIRLIE Men). Skepticism surrounding the validity of the project is fueled by the fact that Entertainment Weekly, the first to initially report on the project, has a newsstand date of April 1, which naturally raises doubts. Furthermore, Ray Gustini from the Atlantic has highlighted the cartoonish nature of the project's details, which has added to the overall uncertainty. Scott Roxborough from the Hollywood Reporter, despite expressing doubts about the project's legitimacy, has pointed out Arnold Schwarzenegger's previous announcement of a new television series. He also mentions the unveiling of more details next week, which might provide some credibility to the claims. However, some aspects of the project still sound dubious, such as the actor's collaboration with Stan Lee and his claim that he didn't inform his wife, Maria Shriver, about the project beforehand. Ultimately, the truth behind \\"The Governator\\" project remains uncertain, leaving fans eager for more information to determine whether it is genuinely Schwarzenegger's next venture or merely an elaborate prank."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Without a plan, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough right things. Time management is not doing the wrong things more rapidly. That just gets us nowhere faster. Time management is doing the right things. Work with a messy   desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends, on average, one and a half hours per day in looking for things. That's seven and a half hours per week.

Answer this question: when did lean on me the song come out??","output":"\\"Lean on Me\\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Bill Withers. As a representative work of soul and R&B, it has a profound influence that resonates with multiple generations. The song \\"Lean on Me\\" was first released as a single from Bill Withers' second album, \\"Still Bill.\\" This album came out in 1972, marking a significant point of Bill Withers' career and becoming one of his most unforgettable works. To be more specific, the song was released as a single in April of 1972.  \\"Lean on Me\\" is an iconic song about friendship and reliance; its up-tempo and feel-good rhythmic pattern has been ingrained into popular culture. The song itself quickly climbed the Billboard charts, eventually spending three weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking it a huge commercial success as well. With its uplifting lyrics and universal message, it is no surprise that it resonated with listeners, leading it to become one of Bill Withers' most recognized tracks and one of the most beloved songs across generations. The song's importance in music history is evidenced by its induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007. Moreover, “Lean on Me” was added to the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2015, which deemed the song “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” “Lean on Me” has been covered numerous times by various artists across diverse genres – from pop and rock to gospel. Among the most notable artists are Club Nouveau, whose 1986 version won a Grammy for Best R&B Song, and artists like Michael Bolton, Sheryl Crow, Mary J. Blige and Kid Rock, who performed the song for the Hope for Haiti Now global benefit in response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. In many ways, \\"Lean on Me\\" transcends categorization. It's not strictly soul or pop, but rather a timeless piece that continues to connect and comfort people worldwide, proving the enduring power of music and the timeless appeal of Bill Withers' artistry.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is \\"Susan\\" the same as \\"she\\" in this sentence? Jane knocked on Susan 's door but *she* did not answer.","output":"In the sentence \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door but she did not answer,\\" the pronoun \\"she\\" is most likely referring to Susan. This interpretation is based on the overall context and meaning of the sentence. Here's a more detailed explanation of why this is the case: 1. From the sentence structure, two actions are described in the same sentence, which are closely related—knocking on Susan's door and not answering. From the reader's perspective, it would be natural to connect the two events and assume that the pronoun 'she' is referring to the person whose door is being knocked on, in this case, Susan. 2. The pronoun \\"she\\" is used to replace a noun or noun phrase referring to a female person that was mentioned earlier in the text or conversation. Typically, when a pronoun is placed so close to its antecedent (the word it is replacing) in the sentence, it is reasonable to assume it refers to that antecedent. In this sentence, Susan is the only female person mentioned before the pronoun \\"she,\\" so it is reasonable to assume that \\"she\\" refers to Susan. 3. The purpose of pronouns is to avoid repetition and create a smoother, more coherent text or conversation. In this context, the use of \\"she\\" serves that role by substituting Susan's name and providing continuity from one action to another. It would make for a more coherent and fluent sentence compared to repeating Susan's name, such as \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door, but Susan did not answer.\\" Therefore, based on the contextual clues within the sentence and the grammatical rules of pronoun usage, it is reasonable to assume that \\"she\\" in this sentence refers to Susan. While there may be rare cases where the pronoun might have been intended to refer to a different female person who was mentioned earlier but not in the sentence, the most straightforward interpretation is that \\"Susan\\" and \\"she\\" are the same in this particular sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name \\"Dr. Seuss\\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and a graduate student at the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. Geisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or watercolors, but in his children's books of the postwar period, he generally made use of a starker medium--pen and ink--normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as The Lorax, used more colors.  Geisel's style was unique - his figures are often \\"rounded\\" and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of the Grinch and the Cat in the Hat. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, If I Ran the Circus shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy steam calliope.  Geisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects. His endlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count, from Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, or the \\"most peculiar machine\\" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in The Sneetches. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of Bartholomew Cubbins, the tail of Gertrude McFuzz, and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.  Geisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of \\"voila\\" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish when he creates fish (who perform the gesture with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of If I Ran the Circus, and in the introduction of the \\"Little Cats\\" in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.  Geisel also follows the cartoon tradition of showing motion with lines, like in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in If I Ran the Circus. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses--sight, smell, and hearing--in The Big Brag, and lines even illustrate \\"thought\\", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas. What else did he do in these books?","output":"In addition to the unique artistic style and illustrations that Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, employed in his children's books, he also incorporated several other elements that contributed to the charm and appeal of his works.  First and foremost, his use of language was innovative and engaging, often making use of playful rhymes, inventive wordplay, and even made-up words. This whimsical approach to language not only made the stories fun to read but also helped young readers develop their language skills and encouraged a love for reading. His books, such as \\"Green Eggs and Ham,\\" \\"The Cat in the Hat,\\" and \\"Hop on Pop,\\" are prime examples of his mastery of language. Secondly, Geisel infused his stories with important moral lessons, often addressing complex themes such as environmentalism, tolerance, and the consequences of greed in a way that was easily digestible for children. For example, the book \\"The Lorax\\" conveys an environmentally conscious message, while \\"The Sneetches\\" tackles issues of discrimination and prejudice. These valuable life lessons helped make Dr. Seuss' books not only entertaining but also educational and heartfelt. In addition to the artwork, language, and moral lessons, Dr. Seuss' books also had an element of imagination and fantasy, which fascinated young readers and let them explore different worlds and scenarios. The innovative characters he created, such as the Grinch, Horton the Elephant, and the Whos, are a testament to his boundless creativity and ability to captivate his audience's attention. Furthermore, Dr. Seuss' books often challenged societal norms, pushing against the boundaries of traditional children's storytelling and presenting subversive and unconventional ideas. This progressive approach to storytelling can be seen in books such as \\"Yertle the Turtle,\\" wherein the titular character's quest for power ultimately leads to his downfall. In summary, Dr. Seuss' books incorporated not only unique artistic styles and illustrations but also inventive language, important moral lessons, imaginative fantasy, and progressive ideas. His works have continued to impact and inspire generations of children, encouraging a love for reading and learning while leaving a lasting impression on young minds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Another release in 2008 directly compared the sequences of a second isolate of BiMoV from Taiwan with the sequence of SCSV from Florida . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the exact same information, as they contain subtle differences in the origins of the compared sequences for BiMoV and SCSV isolates. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences to highlight their contrasting aspects: Sentence 1: - The publication is referred to as \\"another publication.\\" - It states that the sequences of a second isolate of BiMoV from Florida were compared to the sequence of SCSV from Taiwan. - This implies that the BiMoV isolate was originally from Florida, and the SCSV isolate was from Taiwan. Sentence 2: - The publication is referred to as \\"another release.\\" - It states that the sequences of a second isolate of BiMoV from Taiwan were compared to the sequence of SCSV from Florida. - This implies that the BiMoV isolate was originally from Taiwan, and the SCSV isolate was from Florida. In summary, while both sentences describe a 2008 publication comparing the sequences of a second isolate of BiMoV to the sequence of SCSV, the key difference lies in the origins of the isolates. In Sentence 1, the BiMoV isolate is from Florida, and the SCSV isolate is from Taiwan. In contrast, Sentence 2 states that the BiMoV isolate is from Taiwan, and the SCSV isolate is from Florida. This difference in isolate origin implies that the two sentences are not communicating the same exact information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mr Dundar, Cumhuriyet's editor-in-chief, and Mr Gul, its Ankara bureau chief, were released in the early hours of Friday after spending 92 days in prison.

Finally , we say that a distribution is concave if formula _ 11 is regular .","output":"While both sentences convey similar information, there are subtle differences in their grammatical structure, formatting, and style. Here's a detailed comparison: 1. Formatting and style:    - In the first sentence, the word \\"Formula\\" is capitalized, suggesting that it is a proper noun or a specific name given to that particular formula. In the second sentence, the word \\"formula\\" is written in lowercase, indicating that it is a common noun referring to any generic mathematical formula.        - In the first sentence, the number \\"11\\" is written directly after the word \\"Formula,\\" without any additional punctuation or space. In the second sentence, there is an underscore \\"_\\" between \\"formula\\" and \\"11.\\" While this difference may seem trivial, it is relevant in the context of a formal document or a coding environment, where formatting is essential. 2. Grammatical structure:    - Both sentences use the same words and phrases, but their placement is different. In the first sentence, \\"the Formula 11\\" is used, while in the second sentence, it is written as \\"formula _ 11.\\" Although both phrases refer to the same concept - a specific mathematical formula - the grammar and structure of the two sentences are slightly different. Overall, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, stating that a distribution is considered concave if a particular formula (denoted as \\"Formula 11\\" or \\"formula _ 11\\") is regular. Despite the minor differences in grammar, formatting, and style, the core meaning remains the same, and readers familiar with the subject matter would likely interpret both sentences in a similar manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys.  Question: suppose The body goes through a kidney transplant happens, how will it affect \\"Kidneys cant filter the blood\\".  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Kidney transplants are often considered when an individual is suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys can no longer function efficiently to filter the blood. In such cases, a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor is transplanted into the recipient's body to re-establish normal kidney function. When the body goes through a kidney transplant, several factors can determine the effectiveness and success of the procedure. The primary goal of the transplant is to ensure that the newly introduced kidney can filter the blood effectively, thus eliminating or reducing the problem of \\"kidneys can't filter the blood\\".  To understand how the kidney transplant can influence the nephron's ability to filter the blood, we need to assess the compatibility, functionality, and potential risks associated with the transplant. The potential influences can be categorized into three primary scenarios: 1. Improved functionality (More effect): If the newly transplanted kidney is healthy and compatible with the recipient's body, the nephron function to filter the blood will improve. The healthy kidney will increase the filtration rate of waste products, resulting in more waste being removed from the blood, and subsequently, more urine will be produced. This improved functionality will lead to a better quality of life for the recipient, as their body will be able to maintain a proper balance of fluids, electrolytes, and waste products. 2. Similar functionality (No effect): There may be cases where the transplanted kidney's function may be similar to the recipient's original kidneys, showing no significant improvement in the nephrons' ability to filter the blood. This situation can result from various factors such as transplant rejection, infections, or pre-existing conditions in the donor kidney. In this scenario, there will be no alteration to the filtration rate, and the recipient may still require additional treatments or support like dialysis to maintain adequate filtration. 3. Reduced functionality (Less effect): Although rare, it is possible for a kidney transplant to result in reduced kidney function. This can happen if the transplanted kidney experiences rejection, infection, or other complications that could lead to impaired functionality. In this case, the nephron's ability to filter the blood will decrease, leading to a less effective filtration rate, increased waste build-up in the blood, and less urine production. Such outcomes may require further medical intervention, including additional kidney transplant(s) or ongoing dialysis support. Overall, the potential influence of a kidney transplant on the process of blood filtration depends on the transplant's success and compatibility between the donor kidney and the recipient's body. A successful transplant can result in more effective filtration and improved kidney function. However, if complications arise or compatibility is less than ideal, the transplant may result in no effect or reduced functionality of the nephron's ability to filter the blood. In any case, ongoing medical monitoring and follow-up care are essential to ensure long-term success and maintain normal kidney function after a transplant."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.  Question: \\"How did the writer of Democracy in America feel about the extremes of democracy?\\" Response: \\"He was excited by it\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choices: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","output":"Alright, kiddo! So there was a man named Alexis de Tocqueville from France who lived a long time ago, and he liked to think and write about how people live and work together. He wrote a famous book called \\"Democracy in America\\" after he visited the United States. He also wrote another book about some big changes in France. Now, when people asked about what he thought of things being very, very democratic, he didn't really like that idea. He liked the idea of people working together and having a say, but he didn't want things to get too crazy. So, when we look at the choices for whether the response is correct or not, the right answer is [1]. no, because he wasn't excited about the extremes of democracy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Coins: Coins are not a tool used for watering plants and do not have a handle. So, this is not a suitable option. 2. Baseball Bat: A baseball bat is a sports equipment, not a tool for watering plants. It has a handle, but it is not used for making plants wet. So, this is not a suitable option. 3. Coffeepot: A coffeepot is primarily used for holding and serving coffee; however, it has a handle and could potentially be used to water plants if no other options are suitable. While it's not the most appropriate option, it could work in a pinch. 4. Watering Can: A watering can is specifically designed for watering plants and has a handle for easy use.

Left Foot: Although shoes are designed to be worn on our feet, they cannot be kept on our feet all the time. While our feet are a great place for shoes when in use, it is not a practical option for storing shoes. Removing them when not in use is more comfortable and hygienic. 2. Wedding: A wedding is an event, not a place to keep a shoe. While people wear shoes to weddings, it doesn't serve as a storage space once the event is over. 3. Closet: A closet is a dedicated space in a home for storing clothes, footwear, and accessories. Keeping shoes in a closet keeps them organized, clean, and protected from dust and sunlight. It is important to store shoes in a well-ventilated and dry area to prevent mold, bad odors, and deterioration. A closet perfectly fits these requirements. Furthermore, a closet allows you to easily see and access your footwear collection, making it convenient to choose the appropriate pair for any outfit or occasion. 4. Shoebox: While shoeboxes may seem like an ideal storage solution because they are designed for shoes, they are not necessarily the most practical option. Storing shoes in their boxes requires more space than simply stacking or lining them up in a closet. Additionally, retrieving your shoes from a stack of boxes can be inconvenient, and a closed box does not provide sufficient air circulation for the shoes to breathe. 5. House: A house has many rooms and spaces, and shoes can be misplaced or untidily scattered if not stored in a specific area. Keeping shoes throughout the house is not an organized or practical approach. Furthermore, shoes may gather dust, dirt, or grime and could potentially soil your floors or carpets. In conclusion, storing shoes in a closet is the most suitable option among the ones provided. It offers a designated, practical, and space-efficient storage solution that keeps your shoes organized, easily accessible, and in good condition, while maintaining the cleanliness and tidiness of your living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The violent ambush that killed five Dallas police officers and wounded seven more could have been a lot worse, the city's police chief says. Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, was killed by police in the deadly attack Thursday night during a protest against police killings of African American men. Since the shooting deaths of two black men by white police officers over two days last week, protests have been held across the country. Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted. McKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \\"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let's talk about atoms. Atoms are teeny-weeny bits of everything in the whole wide world. They are like super duper tiny Lego blocks that make up everything we see, touch, and feel! To answer your first question: Humans cannot actually cut an atom, just like you can't cut a tiny speck of dust with a pair of scissors. It's just too tiny. Plus, if someone were able to cut an atom, it could make a big boom, so we definitely don't want to try! Now, your second question is about hydrogen atoms in an eyeball.

Our eyeballs, like many other parts of our body, are made up of so many different kinds of these 'beads' or atoms. The number of hydrogen atoms, which would be represented by one color of bead, would be a really, really big number since they are so tiny! So, your two questions are not quite the same thing.

When a new one came out, he would go to the theatre and watch the new movie three or four times. Jerry would also buy videos at Barney's Video Store.

Renowned radio and television presenter Brian Widlake, known for conducting the first-ever televised interview with former South African President Nelson Mandela, has passed away at the age of 85. Widlake's career spanned decades, during which he engaged with some of the world's most influential political and business figures, leaving an indelible mark on the world of journalism. Brian Widlake began his career in the 1950s, starting as a reporter with the World at One on BBC Radio 4 before moving on to present The Money Programme on BBC Two in 1966. He continued this role for almost three decades, becoming one of the most recognized and respected figures in British television journalism. However, Widlake's most famous moment came in 1961, when he secured the first-ever television interview with anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela. At the time, Mandela was the leader of the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC), and had been living underground to evade arrest by the South African government. The interview, conducted in secret and under the threat of Mandela's imminent arrest, highlighted the struggle for freedom and equality that was happening in South Africa. The conversation was broadcasted to millions and brought international attention to the civil rights movement in the region. In addition to interviewing Mandela, Widlake also had a knack for covering some of the most critical financial crises and events of the modern era. His reporting on the UK’s high-profile Sterling Crisis of 1967 and the Three-Day Week in 1974 showcased his ability to provide comprehensive and insightful analysis on complex economic issues. His work during those turbulent times earned him widespread recognition and cemented his reputation as a trusted and knowledgeable voice in journalism. Throughout his career, Brian Widlake shared close friendships with prominent figures in the worlds of politics and business, reflecting the high esteem in which he was held. Perhaps key among these was his camaraderie with Sir David Frost, with whom he co-authored the book \\"Climate for Living\\" in 1978. By melding together his passions for political and financial journalism, Brian Widlake was instrumental in shaping the careers of several young journalists. He believed in fostering the talent of the next generation, and passed on his knowledge and wisdom to those who showed promise and dedication in the field. The untimely passing of Brian Widlake marks the end of an era. The memories of his exceptional work, however, will continue to serve as an inspiration for journalists around the world. As we mourn the loss of Brian Widlake, we also celebrate his immense impact on the world of journalism and his unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth, no matter the circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where is Jack offered a contract to work? Movie title: The Family Man Movie plot: Jack Campbell is a single Wall Street executive living in New York City. He is in the midst of putting together a multi-billion dollar merger and has ordered an emergency meeting on Christmas Day. In his office, on Christmas Eve, he hears that his former girlfriend, Kate, called him after many years. He walks into a convenience store where a lottery contestant, Cash, has a winning ticket worth 238. The store clerk does not believe Cash, so Cash pulls out a gun and Jack offers to buy the ticket. Jack offers to help Cash. In return, Cash questions Jack, asking him if he is missing anything in his life. Jack says he has everything he needs. Cash tells Jack that actions have consequence and that Jack has brought whatever is coming on himself. Jack returns to his penthouse and sleeps. On Christmas Day, Jack wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children. He hurries back to his office and condo in New York, but his closest friends do not recognize him. Jack runs out to the street and encounters Cash driving Jack's Ferrari. Cash explains that Jack is experiencing a glimpse of an alternate universe in order to learn a lesson. He advises Jack to take the time to learn whatever it is that he needs to learn. Jack is living the life he could have had, had he stayed in the United States with his girlfriend. He has a modest family life, where he is a car tire salesman and Kate is a non-profit lawyer. Jack's young daughter realizes his secret, thinks he is an alien and decides to assist him in surviving his new life. Jack struggles to fit into the role of a family man, such as missing opening Christmas presents, flirting with a married woman and forgetting his anniversary.

You might say something like, “I'm afraid to sleep here alone. Will you stay with me?” Use a positive affirmation to empower yourself when fear happens. You might repeat statements like, “You're perfectly safe at home” or “This, too, shall pass” to remind yourself you can get through anything.

For instance, if you feel afraid of public speaking, you might list “good” things like, “I'm dressed well. I prepared all last night for this.

Write a summary based on this article: She was the artist who put the contemporary in contemporary Inuit art, a catalyst for other Inuit artists, young and old, to deal with life as it was in Canada’s North, an award-winning international standard-bearer. And now Annie Pootoogook is dead at 47.      Officials with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in her hometown of Cape Dorset confirmed Friday afternoon that the woman whose body had been recovered Monday morning from the Rideau River in Ottawa was Ms. Pootoogook.      Police said they were not treating the incident as a homicide but crime investigators are seeking the public’s help in retracing the artist’s last hours and days.      Ms. Pootoogook had been living for roughly the past nine years in Ottawa, sometimes on the street and in shelters, sometimes plagued by alcohol and drug abuse and, in 2012, an unwanted pregnancy. She’d relocated there from Nunavut in the wake of a string of major artistic successes in southern Canada and internationally. These included an acclaimed solo exhibition, in 2006, of her ink, crayon, pencil and chalk drawings at Toronto’s Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, one of Canada’s premier venues for cutting-edge art. This in turn led to her winning the 50,000 Sobey Art Award that same year, given annually to an artist of singular talent under 40. In 2007 she was invited to participate at the prestigious Documenta 12 showcase, held every five years in Kassel, Germany. Two years later, she was given a solo show at New York’s National Museum of the American Indian George Gustav Heye Center.      In photos: The work of artist Annie Pootoogook      Ms. Pootoogook’s art was far removed from the imagery of kayaks, walruses, harpoons and the other tried-and-true themes and subjects that had informed much Inuit art from the 1950s onward. She wielded a matter-of-fact, almost deadpan style to closely depict all facets of modern Inuit life, from a husband beating his wife and families shopping, to men watching television porn and women beading.      Ms. Pootoogook, who began drawing in 1997, was the granddaughter of Pitseolak Ashoona, one of the earliest Cape Dorset drawers and print-makers. Her mother Napachie was a prolific graphic artist while father Eegyvudluk was similarly esteemed as a carver and print-maker.      However, after her triumphs of 2006-09, Ms. Pootoogook’s output slowed, then seemed to stop. Toronto dealer Pat Feheley, who’d given Ms. Pootoogook her first commercial bow in 2001 as part of a group show called The Unexpected, then her first solo outing in 2003, told The Globe and Mail in July of 2012 that she hadn’t received an original Pootoogook drawing in more than three years.      In an interview Friday, Ms. Feheley said she was “stunned” by the loss. “She had a rough couple of years but I always thought she’d be back. We’d go back to Dorset and the image bank she would have had would have been amazing.”      Ms. Pootoogook’s art, at least initially, was almost a kind of therapy, Ms. Feheley said. “It was simply to get it out of her head. She didn’t particularly care if they sold or not.”      Tributes were quick to pour in.      Andrew Hunter, Canadian art curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario, called her “a profoundly influential artist who had the courage to push the boundaries of Inuit art.”      Academic curator Gerald McMaster said “her legacy will not be forgotten, in that she leaves us thinking about the same troubled world she was brave enough to depict.”      Nancy Campbell, former AGO associate curator of special projects, spoke of Ms. Pootoogook’s “poignant, often difficult pictures” being “a crucial part of opening the dialogue about art-making in the North.”      Report Typo/Error ||||| Prominent Inuk artist Annie Pootoogook has been identified as the woman whose body was found in Ottawa's Rideau River earlier this week.      Officials with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in her hometown, Cape Dorset, Nunavut, confirmed the death of the chalk-and-ink artist, who rose to prominence when she won the Sobey Award in 2006.      Pootoogook, 47, had been living in Ottawa.      Her drawings offered a contemporary take on her culture, where old customs intermingled with modern technology and goods.      Her work is part of the collections at the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario and was recently part of an exhibition on Indigenous pop art at Ottawa's Saw Gallery.      \\"Her inclusion in the exhibition was a no-brainer, in that she looked at contemporary life in a way no other artist had ever done,\\" said Saw Gallery curator Jason St-Laurent, who first met Pootoogook five years ago.

It was \\"like the artistic lives were already aimed to be passed on to Annie,\\" said Jimmy Manning, the president of the Inuit Art Foundation, in Inuktitut.      Saw Gallery curator Jason St-Laurent, standing in front of one of Annie Pootoogook's drawings, said the artist was a \\"shining light\\" to those who knew her.

St-Laurent described Pootoogook as a free spirit who lived life on her own terms. He said he lost touch with her a few months ago, but said she was always welcome at the gallery.      \\"When she came into Saw, she was a shining light, and made everyone laugh… she was the kindest soul you could ever meet.

Pootoogook’s body was discovered Monday at about 8:50 a.m. in the water close to Bordeleau Park in Lowertown. Police do not consider her death to be suspicious or a homicide, said Const. Marc Soucy. “We just want to recreate her final moments.”      Soucy said an autopsy has been performed, but police are not releasing a cause of death. It is unclear where Pootoogook was last seen.      Pootoogook’s story is one of a rocket ride to superstardom in the art world, followed by a crash into addiction, life on the street and tragedy.      Originally from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, Pootoogook was considered one of Canada’s most pre-eminent Inuit artists. Her grandmother, Pitseolak Ashoona, an artist, was the last to grow up in the traditional Inuit lifestyle. Her mother, Napachie Pootoogook, was also an artist who died in 2002.      Pootoogook began drawing in 1997 and was discovered about 14 years ago by Patricia Feheley of Feheley Fine Arts, a Toronto art gallery that began buying her work through the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in Cape Dorset. Her drawings were a jarring chronicle of modern Inuit life — a family watching Jerry Springer on television, ATM cash machines, scenes of alcoholism and spousal abuse.      Feheley helped to raise Pootoogook’s profile and sold her drawings in coloured pencils for as much has 2,600.      Related      “I was just hit by their power,” Feheley said in a 2012 interview. “The best I have ever heard it described is they are so direct, they are so honest, they so come from the head to the hand to the paper, and that is why they resonate so much with people.”      Pootoogook won the 50,000 Sobey Art Award in 2006 and exhibited on an international scale. In 2007, showed at the Montreal Biennial, the Basel Art Fair in Switzerland and Documenta 12 in Kasel, Germany. In 2009-10 there was a solo show in New York, and a review in the New York Times which called her work “disconcertingly autobiographical.”            Her last solo show was in 2011 in Kingston.      Pootoogook, who has lived in Ottawa since 2007, battled the demons of sexual abuse, alcohol and drugs. By 2012 she had disappeared from view and journalists who attempted to track down the media-shy artist were disappointed. She drew attention again when Citizen reporter Hugh Adami found her in July of 2012, pregnant, panhandling and selling drawings for 25 to 30 on the street to pay for cigarettes.      That September, she gave birth to a baby girl, named Napuchie, in a bathroom at the Shepherds of Good Hope. The baby was a month premature and weighed three pounds, 10 ounces. (She had two previous children on Baffin Island.) Three days later, Pootoogook was back on Rideau Street.      Her art appeared to reflect the torment of her life. Crying While Making a Drawing, dated 2003, shows a woman in tears on her knees in a near-empty room, with drawings of Christian crosses on the floor in front of her. Another drawing from that time period, called Evil Spirit, shows a woman on her hands and knees being tormented by a horned demon.      Last October, Pootoogook told Adami that she was living at a women’s shelter after moving out of an ex-boyfriend’s apartment in the wake of a tumultuous relationship. She said she knew she had an alcohol problem and planned to see an addiction counsellor. She was on probation because she made a “mistake” related to drinking.            “When people tell you to stop drinking,” Pootoogook told Adami, her tendency is to “keep drinking and drinking.”      On Friday, Adami, now retired, said when he first met Pootoogook “I thought she was going to pull it together. People in the art community were reaching out to her. Lots of people wanted to help.”      He interviewed her several times after that, most recently last October. “It was getting worse and worse. She was ravaged by alcohol. She mentioned her baby and started crying. It was very, very sad.”      In a 2012 interview with Citizen arts writer Paul Gessell, Feheley said Pootoogook’s fame was “just too much, too fast.”      “Her vault to stardom, which was serious stardom, was really a two-and-one-half year thing for someone who was living a relatively sheltered life and not that happy a life in Cape Dorset, when suddenly she was in Switzerland and she was in Germany and she won all this money and there were three books and two movies,” said Feheley.      “I think she just literally got overwhelmed.”      Police ask anyone who saw Pootoogook in the days leading up to the discovery of her body to contact the Ottawa Police major crime unit at 613 236 1222, ext. 5493.      Anonymous tips can be submitted by calling Crime Stoppers toll-free at 1-800-222-8477.      jlaucius@postmedia.com ||||| The body of Pootoogook, 46, was spotted in the water around 8:50 a.m. Monday near Bordeleau Park in Lowertown, near the Ontario-Quebec border. An autopsy was performed later in the week to confirm her identity; Ottawa police identified Pootoogook in a news release Friday.      Pootoogook, born in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, was an acclaimed, award-winning contemporary Inuit artist best known for her frank, ink-and-crayon drawings of contemporary northern life. Her work was reflective of her own life and community, at times chronicling her experience of physical and sexual abuse and living with relatives suffering from alcoholism.      In 2006, Pootoogook won the Sobey Art Award, beating out four other shortlisted artists from across Canada for the 50,000 prize. The same year, her work was exhibited at a landmark show at Toronto’s Power Plant Gallery, the first time Canada’s pre-eminent contemporary art venue had held a major show by an Inuit. In 2007 she took part in Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, a prestigious, invitation-only art exhibition — held once every five years — that defines the current state of contemporary and modern art. Pootoogook’s Toronto dealer, Pat Feheley, said at the time that it was the first time that an Inuit artist had been invited to participate.

The answer to the question: What is the title of the painting that was referred to in the earliest inventories as La Familia? is inside the article: The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as La Familia (\\"The Family\\"). A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.

Das Erwachen der grundlegenden Werte, nach denen wir alle streben, bezieht sich auf die Wiederentdeckung und Wertschätzung von Prinzipien, die für das menschliche Zusammenleben und das Funktionieren einer gerechten und harmonischen Gesellschaft von entscheidender Bedeutung sind. Diese grundlegenden Werte umfassen Aspekte wie Ehrlichkeit, Respekt, Mitgefühl, Gleichheit und Fairness. In einer zunehmend globalisierten und digitalisierten Welt, in der Menschen oft auf der Suche nach schnellen Lösungen und oberflächlichen Erfolgen sind, besteht die Gefahr, dass diese grundlegenden Werte vernachlässigt oder vergessen werden. Das Erwachen dieser Werte bedeutet, dass Menschen beginnen, über die Bedeutung von ethischen und moralischen Prinzipien in ihrem Leben nachzudenken und ihr Handeln danach auszurichten. Ein solches Umdenken kann durch persönliche Erfahrungen, den Austausch mit anderen Menschen, das Lesen von inspirierenden Büchern oder das Hören von motivierenden Geschichten ausgelöst werden. Es führt dazu, dass Menschen bewusster und reflektierter mit sich selbst, ihren Mitmenschen und ihrer Umwelt umgehen. Während das Erwachen grundlegender Werte auf individueller Ebene stattfinden kann, hat es auch Auswirkungen auf das gesellschaftliche Zusammenleben. So entstehen vermehrt Initiativen und Projekte, die auf soziale Gerechtigkeit, Umweltschutz, Bildung und Zusammenarbeit abzielen, und Menschen setzen sich für die Stärkung demokratischer und menschenrechtlicher Werte ein. Die Suche nach den grundlegenden Werten, nach denen wir alle streben, führt also zu einer Erkenntnis, dass wir als Individuen und als Gesellschaft mehr erreichen und ein zufriedeneres Leben führen können, wenn wir uns an diesen Werten orientieren.

Given the question: I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.  Now, I have a new situation: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together. They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\"?

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple.

The kids suddenly turn against everything around them and trash the apartment to complete annihilation. The kids are called \\"Destruction Incorporated\\", a bunch of self-imposed derelicts who terrorize a sleepy Florida town. They are led by the near-psychotic Dexter, his pal Denny, Denny's girlfriend Bitsy, and their friend Lummox.

Afterwards, Dexter and a few of the Destruction crew pile into Dexter's 1967 white Mustang car and drive around town terrorizing and harassing the locals. One teenybopper steals a lady's newspaper and sets fire to it. A man is splashed painted when a few other youths throw paint at him. Also, a police officer is contemptuously taunted. At a corner coffee shop, the overly zealous teens engage in a bloody fist fight with another teenager, named Doug, who used to know Dexter and was part of his gang before walking away years ago. As result of the rumble, the group begins to trash the place. The proprietor threatens to call the police, but is cut short when one of the teenyboppers punches him in the face.

Federal prosecutors say Benjamin Yoho, 41, dumped the debris between October 2014 and April in the Uncompahgre National Forest near the Jud Wiebe Trail.      Authorities say he built a structure in the forest where he lived.      Yoho was also sentenced to one year of probation in the case.      He was convicted of residing, maintaining a structure and leaving debris on national forest land.

Benjamin Yoho, 41 of Telluride and Ouray, was convicted after a one-day bench trial before U.S. Magistrate David West in Durango on charges of massive littering in an area north of Telluride.      Officials said from October 2014 to April, Yoho lived and had a structure on Forest System land and transported several items from the Telluride “Free Box” where he littered a large area near the Jud Wiebe Trail.      In May, 48 volunteers and numerous crews from the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control removed about 8,500 pounds of debris from the forest by helicopter.      Yoho was convicted of residing on National Forest system lands, maintaining a structure in the National Forest and leaving debris in the forest. He will serve one year of probation after his release from prison.      “This was no ordinary case of littering in the National Forest — this was full-scale trashing of the public lands and merited a term of incarceration,” U.S. Attorney John Walsh said in a statement.      “Individuals residing on National Forest lands is not only illegal, it poses a significant public safety concern and causes damage to the resources and watersheds, as well as threatening wildlife and in some cases prevents the public from being able to safely recreate in the national forest,” U.S. Forest Service special agent in charge Laura Mark said.      Added San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters: “I hope this serves as a warning to all that trashing our National Forest is unacceptable behavior.

George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner.

George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide.

Wouldn't it be better if healthcare was free?\\" What country offers the best Healthcare system in the world? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices:  (a). no.  (b). yes.","output":"While America is often depicted as the \\"world's best country,\\" it is important to examine its healthcare system in greater detail to address the concerns mentioned. The United States is the only developed country that does not offer free or universal healthcare to its citizens, which has led to some people being unable to afford the healthcare they need. This issue stems from various factors, including the complexity of the insurance system, high healthcare costs, and the significant role of private healthcare providers in the industry. Several factors contribute to the high cost of healthcare in the United States. First, the country lacks a centralized negotiation system for the prices of medical services, treatments, and medications, which results in wide price variations. Second, administrative costs are considerably higher compared to other countries, partly due to the multiplicity of private insurance companies and the complexity of the billing process. Finally, the high demand for medical services, expensive medical equipment, and advanced technologies also contribute to the rising healthcare costs in America. However, just because there are people who can barely afford healthcare in America does not necessarily mean the country as a whole is not the \\"world's best.\\" The United States is known for its technological advancements, research, and innovation in the healthcare sector. Additionally, the American healthcare system is highly regarded for its quality and patient satisfaction. Although these factors do not guarantee accessible healthcare for everyone in the country, they showcase America's strengths in certain aspects of healthcare. In terms of which country offers the best healthcare system in the world, there is no universal consensus as each nation has its unique strengths and weaknesses. However, countries with universal healthcare systems, like Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, consistently rank high on global healthcare indices. For instance, in the 2020 Euro Health Consumer Index, the Netherlands secured the top position, followed by Switzerland and Norway. Similarly, in the 2019 Global Health Security Index, the United States ranked first, followed by the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. Concerning the multi-choice problem, the two questions discussed above are not the same. The first question asks about the limitations of the American healthcare system and the benefits of free healthcare, while the second question seeks to identify the country with the best healthcare system globally. So, the answer to the multi-choice problem is: (a). No."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please add spaces between words: IndustrialProductsLimitedLifetimeWarranty","output":"Industrial Products Limited Lifetime Warranty Here is the phrase provided with spaces added between each word: Industrial Products Limited Lifetime Warranty This phrase represents a type of warranty offered by a company specializing in producing industrial products. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation for each word or phrase in the context of the warranty. 1. Industrial Products: This term refers to items or goods that are manufactured for use in various industries and businesses. Industrial products encompass a wide range of items, such as machinery, tools, equipment, replacement parts, and supplies. These products are typically designed with durability, functionality, and efficiency in mind, helping various industries to carry out their tasks effectively. 2. Limited: The term \\"limited\\" in a warranty context implies that there are certain limitations or restrictions to the warranty coverage. These limitations can be based on time, usage, the scope of coverage, or other specific conditions defined by the issuing company. In general, a limited warranty offers less comprehensive coverage compared to a full or unconditional warranty. 3. Lifetime: The term \\"lifetime\\" is often used in warranties to indicate the intended duration of the warranty coverage. Typically, a lifetime warranty means that the warranty will remain in effect for the entire lifespan of the product, as long as it is owned by the original purchaser. However, this can also vary depending on the conditions imposed by the warranty provider. In some cases, a \\"lifetime\\" warranty may refer to a specific number of years or be based on the expected useful life of the product according to industry standards. 4. Warranty: A warranty is a formal assurance provided by a manufacturer or company that a product will perform as intended, meeting the necessary quality standards and criteria. If a product covered under warranty does not meet the stipulated expectations, the warranty provides the consumer with protection against defects, entitling them to repairs, replacements, or refunds as per the warranty terms and conditions. In summary, the term \\"Industrial Products Limited Lifetime Warranty\\" refers to a warranty offered by a company that produces industrial products. This warranty covers the product for its entire lifespan, usually while it is owned by the original purchaser, but comes with specific limitations or restrictions based on the conditions laid out by the warranty provider. The warranty ensures that the industrial products will function as intended, and if they do not, the buyer will be entitled to receive repairs, replacements, or refunds in accordance with the warranty terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Erin offered to help Victoria to overcome shyness because","output":"Erin knew what it was like to be held back by shyness. Erin had once been painfully shy herself, but through trial and error, she had managed to gain her own self-confidence. Erin saw the same struggle in Victoria and couldn't bear to see her new friend go through that emotional turmoil alone. Step 1: Build a connection Erin began by spending more time with Victoria, making sure that their bond strengthened. She believed that trust and understanding were essential for any progress they hoped to make. Step 2: Identify the causes  Next, Erin had conversations with Victoria to identify the root causes of her shyness. Through these conversations, Erin found out that Victoria's shyness was rooted in fear of being judged and rejected by others. This insight would help Erin in devising strategies to help her friend. Step 3: Address the fears Erin started working with Victoria on reframing her thought patterns surrounding judgement and rejection. One tactic they employed was role-playing in a safe environment, with Erin providing constructive feedback and encouragement after each scenario. Step 4: Encouragement and positive reinforcement To further boost Victoria's self-esteem and confidence, Erin made sure to acknowledge and praise her strengths and accomplishments, both big and small. She provided constant encouragement and reminded her friend of her value and uniqueness. Step 5: Gradual exposure Erin believed that it was necessary to put Victoria in situations that would push her out of her comfort zone incrementally. They began attending events or meet-ups together and started with small goals like initiating conversations or participating in group activities. Step 6: Empower Victoria to face challenges independently Now that Victoria was starting to gain confidence, it was time for her to face the world on her own. Erin empowered her to take up challenges independently, and assured Victoria that she would always be there for support whenever needed. Step 7: Reassess and move forward As Victoria practiced these newfound skills, Erin would reassess with her every few weeks to troubleshoot and reassess any remaining shyness triggers. This allowed them to adapt their strategies and to focus on Victoria's specific needs at each stage of her journey. Over time, Victoria's shyness began to give way to self-assuredness, as she blossomed into a more confident, outgoing individual. She no longer allowed her insecurities to hold her back, and she used the tools Erin provided her to face any challenges life threw her way. Victoria became forever grateful to Erin, knowing that without her friend's guidance and support, she might have never discovered her true potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Give me the correct facts to answer this: what political party was henry clay? Answer:","output":"Henry Clay, an American statesman and skilled orator, was a member of multiple political parties throughout his career, with the most prominent ones being the Democratic-Republican Party, the National Republican Party, and the Whig Party. Here is a detailed breakdown of his affiliations: 1. Democratic-Republican Party: During the early years of his political career, Clay was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the 1790s. The party favored a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution, minimal federal government involvement in economic affairs, and strong support for states' rights. As a rising political figure in Kentucky, Clay served in the Kentucky legislature from 1803 to 1809, before moving on to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1811. He was elected Speaker of the House on the first day of his term, reflecting his popularity among the Democratic-Republicans. Clay was a strong advocate for the War of 1812, which played a crucial role in heightening his national profile.  2. National Republican Party: As the Democratic-Republican Party began to fracture in the early 1820s, Clay aligned himself with the National Republican Party, which was established around 1825. The National Republicans were a faction that supported economic nationalism, advocating for federally-funded infrastructure and the establishment of a central bank. This party formed in opposition to President Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party, with Clay serving as a leading figure. The National Republican Party eventually emerged as a distinct entity, nominating Clay as their presidential candidate in the 1832 election. However, Clay lost the election to Jackson. 3. Whig Party: Following the decline of the National Republican Party, Henry Clay became a founding member of the Whig Party in 1833-1834. The Whig Party was created as a coalition of anti-Jackson politicians, united in their opposition to what they saw as the autocratic and authoritarian policies of President Jackson. The Whigs supported a strong federal government, particularly in the realms of economic development and national infrastructure, reflecting Clay's \\"American System\\" of economic plans. Clay served as a key leader of the Whig Party and ran as their presidential candidate in 1844, ultimately losing to the Democratic candidate James K. Polk. In conclusion, Henry Clay's political affiliations evolved throughout his career, beginning with the Democratic-Republican Party, transitioning to the National Republican Party, and finally co-founding the Whig Party. He was an instrumental figure in shaping the platforms and policies of these parties, reflecting his dedication to a robust federal government, economic development, and a strong emphasis on national unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The release of radiation from an underground nuclear explosion - an effect known as \\"venting\\" - would give away clues to the technical composition and size of a country's device, and therefore its nuclear capability. The test site is carefully geologically surveyed to ensure suitability. Such tests usually take place well away from population centres. The nuclear device is placed into a drilled hole or tunnel usually between 200-800m (650-2,600ft) below the surface, and several metres wide. A lead-lined canister containing monitoring equipment is lowered into the shaft above the chamber. The hole is then plugged with gravel, sand, gypsum and other fine materials to contain the explosion and fallout underground. The device is remotely detonated from a surface control bunker. The nuclear explosion vaporises subterranean rock, creating an underground chamber filled with superheated radioactive gas. As this cools, a pool of molten rock collects at the bottom of the chamber. Minutes or hours after the blast, as the pressure falls, the chamber collapses in on itself causing subsidence and a crater to appear on the surface. Seismic waves equivalent to a 5.1-magnitude earthquake were registered near the Punggye-ri nuclear site in a remote area in the east of the country, rattling Chinese border cities. Hours later, state media announced the first \\"successfully performed\\" underground test on a hydrogen bomb. Nuclear experts have expressed some scepticism, saying they would have expected a larger blast from an H-bomb, but it could be weeks before independent tests can verify or dismiss the claim.

The website now features royal-themed first birthday sets along with a new range of baby shower celebration accessories. While many customers are excited to indulge in the exquisite event supplies, the family behind the company has been accused of 'cashing-in' on events, particularly those related to their royal connections. Royal-Themed First Birthday Sets Party Pieces, owned by the family of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, presents a host of royal-themed products to customers worldwide, ensuring that every special event becomes a memorable moment. Among their latest offerings are a range of first birthday sets, reminiscent of the opulent celebrations the UK's royal family is known for. The lavish sets include themed tableware, decorations, and various entertaining supplies, allowing parents to create the perfect royal setting for their little prince or princess. Selena Button, a mother of a one-year-old, raves about the new royal collection. \\"My daughter's first birthday was truly special thanks to the incredible attention to detail on these Middleton's party supplies. Everyone felt like they were in the company of royalty,\\" she said. New Baby Shower Accessories Range In addition to the first birthday sets, Middleton's Party Pieces has also launched a new range of baby shower celebration accessories, appealing to parents looking to organize a regal party in anticipation of their newborn. This stylish collection comprises tableware, decorations, and invitations that bear the same high-quality finish one would expect from a royal event.

The family has been previously accused of using their royal ties to cash in on events, evoking a myriad of varying opinions on this subject. 'Cashing-In' on Events Numerous commentators have accused the Middleton family of exploiting their relationships with the UK's most prominent family to profit from their company's sales. Their association with the royal family and their large following can contribute to the popularity of their products, potentially boosting revenue.

Is the family truly passionate about providing exceptional event supplies, or are they just focusing on the benefits that their royal connections bring?\\" Conclusion While the debate on whether the Middleton family is unfairly leveraging their royal connections to boost their business continues, one cannot deny that their royal-themed products have made a grand entrance to the market of luxury party supplies. As customers continue to share their excitement for the elegant range of themed decorations trending across social media, the opulent world of regal celebrations becomes increasingly accessible. The popularity of Middleton's Party Pieces may in part be driven by the global fascination with the royal family; however, the quality and creativity of their products undoubtedly contribute to the ongoing success of the company. Regardless of the controversy surrounding their royal ties, Middleton's Party Pieces continues to thrive, fulfilling the dreams of their customers by creating unforgettable events fit for royalty."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Problem:Su Can is a general who leads a military force to save a prince from a large fortress of enemies in the mountains. In return, the prince promises that the Emperor will make him governor of Hu Bei. Su's step brother Yuan is envious of Su, but Su loves him and asks the prince to make Yuan governor instead. Su wants to leave the military and lead a life pursuing the perfection of Wu Shu, eventually in the hopes of starting his school and teaching his skills. Su gives his great prestigious sword to a comrade Ma, then tells Yuan of his plans. Yuan expresses that he is always in Su's shadow but accepts the governorship. Early next morning, Su leaves on a horse.Five years later, Su and his wife Ying (Yuan's sister) have a child, Feng. Su's father informs them that Yuan is returning from the military to be a governor. He warns Su that Yuan may not have come back simply to reconcile with family but to seek revenge. This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning an evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbours concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright.When Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held. Yuan greets his sister Ying, Feng, and Su's father. Su's father knows what is impending and asks Yuan to take his revenge on him alone, sparing Su and his family. Using his mastery of the Five Venom Fists, Yuan kills Su's father and decapitates him. He expresses his desire to be with his sister (Ying) and her son Feng as a family. When Su hears the news of his father's murder, he rushes to the scene of his father's death and is attacked by the Iron Twins. He chases them to a rapid where Yuan is offering Su's father's head to his real father as a symbol of revenge taken. A battle ensues between Yuan and Su. Yuan has a dark armour sewn into his body, making him partially invulnerable to blades. Using his Five Venom Fists, Yuan deals a deadly poisonous blow to Su who is defeated. Feng begs for Su's life and Yuan spares him but throws him into the rapids. Ying jumps into the rapid to save Su and Yuan is heartbroken at the loss of his beloved sister. He takes Feng in as his only family.Ying awakes in forest area and tries to bring her husband to civilization and safety. They are found by a herb researcher and wine maker, Sister Yu, who treats Su's wounds. Su comes to consciousness but is broken to find his right arm severely weakened with all tendons torn. At first, he is desperate and turns to drinking, but with Ying's support, he focuses on training in order to save Feng. He meets Wu Shu God and an old sage and asks to be their disciple. At a sacred site, he trains with the Wu Shu God for years, always trying to defeat him but never able to. Later, by checking Su's pulse, Dr. Du reveals to Ying that Su is going mad and that there is probably no Wu Shu God or Old Sage since she is the only one living in the area. Ying follows Su into the forest one day and finds him fighting (seemingly) with himself, oblivious to the fact that he is only battling with the Wu Shu God in his mind. Ying pleads with Su to come to his senses but he does not believe her. By the time Su realizes the truth, it is too late. Ying has left to try to save Feng by herself.At Yuan's palace, Ying is now a captive of Yuan. Su arrives shortly after and fights his way through the guards. He also battles the Iron Twins and with his improved skills, impales both on a podao, a saber like spear. Yuan orders his men to bury Ying alive in a box and then kills the men who buried her so that only he knows her location. A crazed Su battles with Yuan in his training chamber and ultimately defeats him, even gnashing though a poisonous snake in the process. Feng screams that Yuan must not die because only he knows Ying's location, but a maddened Su delivers a fatal blow to Yuan's throat, thus executing him in anger. Realizing the words of Feng, he rushes out and a dying soldier reveals the vague location of Ying. Su and Feng rush to search for her but are too late digging her out. Ying dies from lack of air, and Su goes mad with grief.The era changes from the dynastic to the colonized. Su has lost his mind after the loss of his wife and the previous delusions he had. A homeless Feng leads his father through the streets by rope and takes care of him. A Kung Fu master is killed in a fighting arena - part of a foreigners' club - leaving Su's old friend, Ma, as leader of the Wu Shu Federation. The arena is a stage below which tigers lurk freely, waiting for any unfortunate fighter to drop below.In the meantime, Su goes into an inn and creates trouble by stealing wine and countering people bent on stopping him with martial art moves. He then meets a fellow drunkard (the Wu Shu God in disguise) who spars with him and gives him a few philosophical tips. The two of them start using Drunken Fighting (Zui Quan) techniques, and Su regains his sanity. The inn lady calls Ma to deal with Su and Ma recognizes Su. They have a talk and Ma gives Su back his sword. Su asks Ma to take care of Feng since he is unfit to be a father but Feng persists, staying with his father instead.The next day, Su and Feng show up to support Ma in his arena battle. Su goes about drinking in the club's bar area, oblivious to Ma receiving a serious beating in the ring. When Feng tries to save Ma from being killed, the opposing wrestler grabs Feng and holds him in the air. Feng screams for help from his father. His son's cries awake Su from his drunken state and Su rushes into the arena. As Ma and Feng are being taken out of the arena by bystanders, Su battles and defeats the wrestler. Anthony, owner of a wrestling stable, orders his lot to pour into the arena, resulting in a mismatch of three wrestlers to one (Su). Using the drunken martial arts technique learned from his fellow drunkard in the inn, Su's defeats the fighters although he is heavily injured. At the end of the battle, the other fighters are either dead or unconscious, and only after a vision of Ying and the dramatic cries of Feng in an otherwise silenced arena, does a semi-conscious Su manage to stand up. He is declared the winner.The film ends with a seemingly restored Su practising his moves of old but with long hair reminiscent of the insane period of his life, with Feng observing. Su has seemingly found his passion., Question: What is Su's son's name? Solution:","output":"Feng"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Another one of my favorite buffets!!! No, it's not on the strip. Yes, it's at the M Resort... Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance.  Totally worth it.  Along with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol  So at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week.  There's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain.   I never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this.  There's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though. They serve espresso and coffee in that dessert section as well, but I'm usually all tapped out to get anything from there.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as largely positive, with a few minor critiques. Let's analyze it step by step: 1. The reviewer starts by stating that it is one of their favorite buffets, which indicates a strong positive sentiment. 2. They mention that the location is off the strip and surrounded by nothing, which may be considered slightly negative, but they immediately follow up with \\"Totally worth it,\\" reinforcing a positive sentiment. 3. The mention of unlimited drinks, including beer, wine, and cider, is seen as a positive aspect of the buffet. 4. The reviewer discusses the different buffet options available, highlighting the weekend seafood buffet, which is a favorite of theirs. This shows a positive sentiment. 5. They mention how there is an incredible selection of food, reinforcing the positive sentiment. 6. The reviewer talks about their personal food choices when visiting the buffet, describing their enjoyment and satisfaction. 7. They mention that they never eat the sushi or Asian food due to their preference for other options, which could be slightly negative, but this appears to be a personal preference and not an overall critique of the buffet. 8. The dessert selection is described as huge, but the reviewer shares mixed feelings, saying that they don't like the desserts as much as another buffet's desserts. This is a minor critique, making this part of the review somewhat negative. 9. In conclusion, they mention that they're usually too full to try the espresso and coffee, suggesting they generally leave satisfied. Overall, the review is mostly positive, with the reviewer enjoying the buffet and its variety of food options, along with its unlimited drinks. The minor critiques are focused on the dessert selection and the location being off the main strip."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Urinalysis (urine analysis) often provides clues to renal disease. Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless.   Q: Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to what is the likely cause?   A: OPTIONS: (1). Hypothyroid (2). aeration (3). occidentalis (4). glomeruli Answer:","output":"Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely cause.

The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  I am facing a new situation today: Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, Company B would not have significant tax benefits of debt since it is mostly financed by equity. The tax benefits of debt generally arise when a company has a higher proportion of debt financing, as the interest payments on debt are tax-deductible. In contrast, Company B's financing structure, which relies primarily on equity, does not provide these same tax advantages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The difference in the sentences lies in the tense and structure but not in the meaning of the word \\"snow.\\" In the first sentence, \\"It started to snow,\\" the verb \\"snow\\" is used in the infinitive form (to snow) to show an action that began in the past. The verb \\"started\\" indicates the commencement of the act of snowing and suggests a specific point in time when the precipitation began. In the second sentence, \\"It is snowing,\\" the verb \\"snow\\" is used in its present participle form (-ing) to create the present continuous tense, which signifies an ongoing action. The present continuous tense implies that snow is falling at the current moment.

Here is a news article: McDonald’s has beefed up the Quarter Pounder as part of a larger effort to spice up its menu and reverse its financial slump. We wanted to see how the new, enhanced burger measures up, value-wise, to “quarter-pound” options at other fast-food joints.      McDonald’s announced this week that the Quarter Pounder is no longer a quarter pound. Actually, it was never really a quarter pound—those measurements refer to the weight of the beef before it is cooked (4 ounces of uncooked beef turns into about 2.8 ounces of cooked beef). Burgers at other chains, of course, also shrink when they’re cooked. But moving forward, McDonald’s patties will now weigh in at 4.25 ounces instead of 4, meaning it’s the biggest (false) quarter pounder of all the (false) quarter pounders offered at burger chains.      Local operators will decide whether they want to increase prices, but those who keep prices the same will offer one of the cheapest burgers, per ounce of beef, of all the major burger chains. ||||| Published on Sep 27, 2011      Pulp Fiction movie clips: http://j.mp/1L5eDtj      BUY THE MOVIE: http://amzn.to/u4q3x7      Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr            CLIP DESCRIPTION:      Vincent (John Travolta) tells Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) about the little differences regarding life in Europe.            FILM DESCRIPTION:      Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

Hillary Clinton is heading to Iowa as the politician that most Democrats would choose as their 2016 presidential nominee. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa said they would support Hillary Clinton if the 2016 caucuses were held today. That number far outpaces the 15% that would opt for Vice President Joe Biden, 7% who would choose Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 5% who would pick Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton will be visiting Iowa for the first time in six years on Sunday when she headlines the last Harkin Steak Fry. Biden, likewise, will be in the state Wednesday to speak at a liberal Catholic event in Des Moines.","output":"Hillary Clinton's overwhelming lead in the new CNN/ORC International poll indicates that she is the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election. With a significant number of registered Democrats in Iowa expressing their support for her candidacy, it is expected that this trend will continue in other key states as well. On the other hand, the poll shows that potential Democratic rivals Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders lag far behind in terms of voter preference in Iowa. It is imperative for these candidates to increase their efforts in terms of campaigning and gaining support from not only Iowa voters but also Democratic voters in other primaries and caucuses. The Harkin Steak Fry will provide Clinton with a high-profile platform to connect with Iowa Democrats and potentially solidify her position as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. This event, which has been hosted annually by Sen. Tom Harkin since 1972, is an ideal stage for aspiring presidential contenders to showcase their vision and policies to the local electorate. Biden, who is slated to visit the state to attend a liberal Catholic event in Des Moines, also has the opportunity to strengthen his base and demonstrate his commitment to progressive values. As the 2016 election campaign season begins garnering more attention, it is essential for Clinton and her rivals to emphasize their individual stances on key political issues, build momentum and engage with voters. They will need to address concerns such as the economy, healthcare, foreign policy, national security, climate change, and social justice. In doing so, they can showcase their leadership capabilities and the potential to guide the nation towards progress. Moving forward, the Democratic candidates will focus on developing grassroots support, refining their messaging, and preparing for the upcoming primary season. They will attempt to differentiate themselves by leveraging their unique experiences, plans, and objectives. It is likely that they will seek endorsements from various political figures, organizations, and unions, which will enhance their credibility and further expand their support base. The race for the Democratic nomination is far from over, but at this stage, Hillary Clinton appears to be the frontrunner in Iowa and is expected to do well in other states. However, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders will continue to work diligently to gain support from voters across the country. In conclusion, the most logical completion of this news story is that Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls indicates her strong position within the Democratic party, making her a favorite for the presidential nomination. However, competitors like Biden, Warren, and Sanders will strive to gain support from the electorate and challenge her in the upcoming caucuses and primaries. As the race progresses, it will be important for all candidates to effectively communicate their vision and policy stances in order to gain the trust and support of the Democratic electorate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 285*d + 57 + 103 = 275*d for d, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation. 2. Move variable terms to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. 3. Isolate the variable (d) to get its value. Let's start solving the equation step by step: 1. Simplify the equation: 285*d + 57 + 103 = 275*d (Combine the constants 57 and 103) 285*d + 160 = 275*d 2. Move the variable terms to one side of the equation and constants to the other side: To do this, we can subtract 275*d from both sides of the equation to move all the d terms to the left side: 285*d - 275*d + 160 = 275*d - 275*d (Combine the d terms) 10*d + 160 = 0 Now, subtract 160 from both sides of the equation to move all the constants to the right side: 10*d = -160 3. Isolate the variable (d) to get its value: Now, we will isolate d by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d, which is 10: 10*d / 10 = -160 / 10 d = -16 So, the value of d is -16.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the near-future, organic virtual reality game consoles known as \\"game pods\\" have replaced electronic ones. The pods are attached to \\"bio-ports\\", outlets inserted at players' spines, through biotechnological umbilical cords. Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of \\"realists\\" fights both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's preeminent game designer, is testing her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group at a seminar. She is shot in the shoulder by an assassin named Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) with an organic pistol, which is undetectable by security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul (Jude Law) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Allegra discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game, may have been damaged due to an \\"UmbyCord\\" being ripped out as the game was being downloaded. To test it, she must plug into the game in tandem with another player she can trust, and talks a reluctant Pikul into installing a bio-port in his own body so he can play the game with her. Pikul, one of a dwindling few who has refused to have a bio-port installed to this point, at first objects due to a phobia about \\"surgical penetration\\", but eventually gives in. They head to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas (Willem Dafoe) to get it installed. Gas deliberately installs a faulty bio-port and the game pod is damaged. Gas (a shotgun in hand) reveals that he is going to kill Allegra for the bounty on her head, but Pikul shoots him with the rivet gun used to install the port. The pair make their way to a former ski lodge used by Allegra's mentor, Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm). He and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port. Inside the game, Pikul realizes that it is hard to tell whether his or Allegra's actions are their own intentions... The answer is:","output":"What are the consequences of blurring the line between reality and the virtual world in the movie eXistenZ, and how do the characters navigate this uncertain environment as they test the game and encounter various obstacles?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta was visibly disappointed after the Gunners suffered a 2-0 defeat in their Champions League Group D opener at Borussia Dortmund. Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck either side of half-time and the German club would have been more emphatic victors than 2-0 but for the reflexes of Wojciech Szczesny and their own wastefulness. Arteta told Sky Sports 5: 'We faced a tough side in one of the most difficult stadiums in Europe, we knew that from the start. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta and vice-captain Per Mertesacker look on after conceding in Dortmund. Ciro Immobile scores Borussia Dortmund's first goal on the stroke of half time which Arteta called sloppy. 'They put us under pressure, it was very sloppy from us to concede the goal with 20 seconds to go in the first half from a long throw from the other side of the pitch and after you are 1-0 down, it's very difficult. They are very quick on the break and we didn't perform well enough tonight.' The 32-year-old Spaniard was aware of the pace Dortmund had up front which Arsenal failed to cope with. He added: 'They put a lot of pace and a lot of pressure up front. When they play here and when you (are familiar) - we've been playing here every year in the Champions League - but we couldn't cope with that and we gave the ball away too many times in our own half in difficult positions.' For the second time in two matches Danny Welbeck illustrated why his finishing is considered below par for a top forward by failing to convert a one-on-one with a goalkeeper. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-0 early in the second period as Borussia Dortmund dominated. Arsene Wenger looks on as his side are completely dismantled by a high-energy Borussia Dortmund. With the match goalless and Arsenal under relentless attack, Welbeck managed to drag Aaron Ramsey's clever pass wide with just Roman Weidenfeller to beat. It was a key moment and the £16million signing from Manchester United, who had other chances to open his Gunners account, only enhanced concerns over his record in front of goal. On the Gunners' chances during the match Arteta added: 'They took the game from where they wanted to take it and that's the disappointing thing for us. 'I think we had three or four very clear chances and I think they had three as well very clear, when it came to chances it was probably equal but I think they were the better side tonight.' Mikel Arteta is put under pressure as the Arsenal midfielders were throughout in the Westfalenstadion. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was delighted with the result and said matches like this make his job one of the best in the world. He said: 'We had three players ruled out of the team to muscle problems so it was not the best night we had but in the morning we made some decisions and I have to say it was a great performance from my team. It was really strong. 'We were brave and fast and really worked, it was everything we needed for this game. 'If you give them one metre of space they are so strong and they make everything with you. You need to brave against these strong players. Arsenal's new striker Danny Welbeck had the Gunners' best chance at 0-0 but slid the ball wide. 'You need go out in space and look for one-to-one situations and be brave enough to lose it because the next one is next to you. 'I enjoyed this game from the first second to the last.' Looking ahead to his side's next tough encounter - Saturday's return to the Bundesliga, Klopp added: 'We did what we have to win this game and for us it was near perfection so the important thing for me is three days and against Mainz, my former club. 'It's hard work all the time but if you see games like this, it's the best job in the world.'","output":"So, Arsenal is a soccer team. Their captain, Mikel Arteta, felt really sad when they lost a game 2-0 against another team called Borussia Dortmund. In soccer, the team with the most goals wins the game. There was a guy named Ciro Immobile who made a goal just before half-time and another guy named Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made another goal too. Arteta was upset because they made some mistakes when they were defending.  Danny Welbeck, a player from Arsenal, had a chance to score a goal, but he missed it. This made Arteta and the team more upset. Dortmund's coach, a man named Jurgen Klopp, was happy because his team did well and won the game. He was especially proud because they had some players who couldn't play because of injury, but they still managed to win. In simple words, Arsenal lost, and their captain was very disappointed. Borussia Dortmund won, and their coach was very happy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored.

With a slightly chaotic boarding process (more noticeable after such a serene start) we were too busy sorting out the seats to realise that we had hopped on board, and within in seconds it seemed, our pilot had lifted off smoothly in a flurry of water foam. As we began to watch the world turn into a Lilliput version of itself, we barely blinked for watching beautiful vistas unfold. From tiny little islands (the above Passage Island technically belongs to West Vancouver, known as the Hollywood suburb of the city, and a couple of the homes are allegedly owned by celebrities) where the residents enjoy views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound – to the fjords all the way along the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler.

Review title: Classic Stories Product review: I bought this book for my three year old daughter because she loves Curious George. It is a good book, but the stories are a little long, longer than the other stories of George that we're used to. Overall, it was a good purchase though. The answer to this question is:","output":"It may slightly decrease the chances of buying the product.  Here's my justification: 1. Identification of Positive and Negative Statements: The review has both positive and negative sentiments. The positive sentiments include the buyer felt it was a good purchase and the child loves Curious George, which is beneficial for others looking for books centering around this character. The negative sentiment is that the stories are longer than expected. 2. Relativity of the Negatives: The negative sentiment does not indicate a problem with the quality or content of the book. Rather, it is related to the length of the stories, which may not be an issue for another potential buyer, depending on the age and reading abilities of their child.  3. Weighing the Positives and Negatives: Since the quality and content are deemed good and the negative sentiment given is a subjective and relative point which could be a non-issue for another buyer, this slightly tips the scale towards decreasing the chances of buying the product.  4. Consideration of the Reviewer's Conclusion: Recognizing the reviewer concluded it was overall a good purchase despite the story length can lean the potential buyer towards purchasing. Overall, the review would probably slightly decrease the chances of buying the book because a potential purchaser might worry about the story length not suiting a child's attention span, particularly if they are used to shorter Curious George stories.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Paul Latour is a prisoner of war in Germany and his wife Marie lives hand-to-mouth with their two children in a squalid flat. A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her, successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging. While talking with Paul one night, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \\"nothing but good things\\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she wouldn't clarify, but alluded to her abortion activities. Marie also confessed to wanting to be a famous singer. Despite her husbands return, she will not resume relations. She sees him as immasculated, and less than a man. Although he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat so that the two can have some privacy. Marie not only has more space for her illicit business but lets a prostitute use a room during the day. She also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator. When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help, suggesting that part of her duties can be to sleep with Paul. After returning home early and witnessing Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them of her illegal activities. A recent law of the Vichy rÃ©gime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write some highlights for the following article: Kenny Ortega, the director of Michael Jackson's aborted comeback show, began his testimony Monday about what AEG Live executives did and said in Jackson's final days. His first hours on the stand Monday afternoon were spent discussing Jackson's creativity, saying his voice, songs and dancing were \\"like no one else in his generation.\\" He will return Tuesday to resume his testimony. Lawyers for Jackson's mother and children argue in the wrongful death trial against AEG Live that those executives ignored warning signs about his health and mental condition that, if heeded, could have saved his life. The lawsuit contends the promoters hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson -- not their executives -- chose and controlled the doctor, who was giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic in a desperate search for sleep in his last two months. Ortega, who knew Jackson well and worked with him closely preparing his \\"This Is It\\" shows, sounded a warning to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips in an e-mail on June 20, 2009 -- five days before Jackson's death -- that Ortega did not think the entertainer would be ready for the shows. He described seeing \\"strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior\\" with Jackson. \\"I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him ASAP.\\" Tabloid report on Jackson 'FBI files' questioned. Expert: MJ was 'drug dependent,' not addicted. AEG says Jackson was secretive about his drug use, which the company contends was an addiction, so there was no way of knowing what treatments Murray was giving Jackson in his bedroom. But a drug addiction expert testified last week that there was \\"not a lot of evidence to support\\" the belief that Michael Jackson was addicted to drugs. If he was an addict, Jackson \\"would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional, taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug-seeking behavior,\\" Dr. Sidney Schnoll testified. There was no evidence Jackson ever took drugs that were not given to him by a doctor or that he took more than prescribed, Schnoll said. The bottles of sedatives found in his home after his death had more pills remaining in them than he would have expected if Jackson was an addict, Schnoll said. This \\"indicated these were not being taken on a regular basis,\\" he said. Evidence shows Jackson sought drugs from a number of doctors, but that was not inappropriate because he needed them \\"to treat a legitimate medical problem,\\" including back pain, scalp pain and dermatologic issues, Schnoll testified. While not addicted, Jackson was dependent on drugs, he said. The painkillers that forced Jackson to end his 1993 \\"Dangerous\\" tour early so he could enter a rehab program were taken to relieve the pain from scalp surgery needed to repair burns suffered when filming a Pepsi commercial, Schnoll said. The burns left scars on damaged nerves in his scalp, which becomes \\"excitable tissue\\" that \\"can be firing just like the nerve,\\" he said. The result \\"can be every painful, like a burning kind of pain -- persistent, sharp, shooting kind of pain,\\" he said. \\"It's very uncomfortable and one of the most difficult to treat.\\" Pain relief is a legitimate use of opioid drugs and a person can function normally if they are taken under a doctor's care, he said. Prince, Blanket Jackson celebrate dad's life amid death trial. President John Kennedy was opioid dependent to relieve \\"very severe back pain\\" while in the White House, he said. \\"He did alright as president?\\" Jackson lawyer Michael Koskoff asked. \\"It depends on your political affiliation,\\" Schnoll answered. The Demerol injections Jackson got during frequent visits to a Beverly Hills dermatologist between April and his death in late June 2009 were given for legitimate medical reasons, Schnoll testified. If he were addicted to Demerol -- which is a powerful opioid -- he would not have gone 43 days between injections, which medical records show, he said. Jackson also went roughly 13 years -- from 1993 until 2008 -- without the drug, he said. The doctor conceded under cross-examination by an AEG Live lawyer, however, that a gap in available medical records may be misleading. Jackson's use of sedatives was an effort to treat his chronic insomnia, Schnoll said. If the underlying sleep problem could be resolved, the chances of ending Jackson's use of the drugs would have been good, he said. There was no indication that Jackson was addicted to propofol before Murray began giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic for 60 days leading up to his death, he said. Nephew: Jackson was murdered. Unheeded warning signs? Ortega, in his e-mail to AEG Live CEO Phillips on June 20, wrote that \\"I honestly don't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state.\\" He said Jackson was having trouble \\"grasping the work\\" at rehearsals. Production manager John \\"Bugzee\\" Hougdahl wrote in an e-mail to Phillips hours earlier that Ortega had sent Jackson home from a rehearsal that night because of his strange behavior. \\"I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now,\\" Hougdahl wrote. \\"He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt. The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive.\\" Phillips replied to Ortega: \\"Please stay steady. Enough alarms have sounded. It is time to put out the fire, not burn the building down.\\" By \\"burn the building down,\\" he meant pulling the plug on the tour that was set to begin in three weeks, Phillips testified last month. \\"In a highly charged situation like this, I just wanted to keep things calm until we could have the meeting.\\" Phillips met with Murray, Jackson and Ortega at Jackson's home later that day. While Jackson lawyers argue that meeting was intended to pressure Murray to make sure Jackson was ready for rehearsals, AEG lawyers contend Murray assured producers nothing was wrong. Phillips testified that he remembered little about the conversation at the meeting and Murray has invoked his constitutional protection against self-incrimination to avoid testifying in the trial. This makes Ortega's testimony crucial for both sides. 'They're going to kill me,' Jackson told son. Hand over evidence or face jail. A related drama could unfold Monday in another courtroom as a judge in Ohio decides if he'll carry out a threat to throw the widow and daughter of a former Jackson manager in jail for refusing to hand over a laptop computer subpoenaed by Jackson lawyers. Frank DiLeo, who served as Jackson's manager decades earlier, reappeared in his life in his last months. He died in 2011. Jackson lawyers want to search his laptop for evidence to support their contention that DiLeo was beholden to the concert promoter and not to Jackson. His daughter, Belinda DiLeo, refused a judge's order last week to disclose where the computer was, prompting the contempt of court order. The judge gave the DiLeo's until Monday to hand it over or face jail. A hearing will be held Wednesday to determine of the women complied with the order. Jackson changed managers twice in the last three months of his life. In late March 2009, he hired Leonard Rowe -- one of his father's friends -- to replace Tohme Tohme, the manager who initially negotiated the deal with AEG for his \\"This Is It\\" tour. Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live forced Jackson to take DiLeo, who had worked for him off and on for decades, as his manager in May 2009 because they did not want to work with Rowe. A cache of 5,000 e-mails has already been recovered and a lawyer in Ohio is reviewing them to redact non-relevant and personal information before handing them over to Jackson lawyers.","output":"Highlights: - Kenny Ortega, director of Michael Jackson's aborted comeback show, testified about the warning signs he observed in Jackson's health and mental state leading up to his death. - Lawyers for Jackson's family argue AEG Live executives ignored these warning signs that could have saved his life. - AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. - Ortega sent an email to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips warning that Jackson would not be ready for the shows and expressing concern over his paranoia, anxiety, and obsessive-like behavior. - Drug addiction expert Dr. Sidney Schnoll testified that there was not much evidence to support the claim that Jackson was addicted to drugs, but he was drug-dependent to treat legitimate medical issues like pain."},{"instruction":"Question: what channel is jay leno on?

Until recently, my father's sister lived in a dangerous and unstable country (I won't go into specifics, but it is somewhere in Africa), however she is still a citizen of our home country and due to the instability, my father offered to get her on a plane house her until she is on her feet. She is nearing retirement age, she has no saving and she cannot drive, and we live in a rural community where work in the local area is scarce. Also important is that I have not seen her or even spoken to her in over 20 years and my fiancée has never met her.  My fiancée and I have been together for approximately 5 years but only moved in together about a year ago. Our house is a very small 2 bed, although the 2nd room is barely more than a box room - it's fine for the two of us, but it gets cramped if we have anyone round. Financially we are comfortable, but we are by no means well off. We're also getting married later this year and plan to start trying for a baby immediately after that. This is all important context.  My father is emigrating later this year, and on christmas day he took me to one side and put me on the spot; if his sister is not on her feet by the time he moves, will we take her in? I was taken aback but I did not give him an answer either way as I was not willing to commit without my fiancé's input. Shortly afterwards however, we returned to the lounge and my father phoned another member of family and, in front of my completely oblivious fiancée, informed them that we'd be happy to take in his sister. My fiancée was gobsmacked but said nothing. After we left however, she erupted and we had a major row - again, on christmas day. Because of the way she found out, she thought I was in on these plans and had agreed to all of this behind her back, and though I eventually convinced her that I was as much in the dark on this as she was, it nevertheless ruined our christmas. After calming down, we sat and talked and decided that we would not take her in. Housing her would compromise our privacy, it would potentially hamper our future plans re: trying for a baby, and  we are simply not in a position financially support a third adult right now. A few days later we went to my father's house to tell him this, however he became very angry and told us to get out. Since then, I have barely spoken to him, and on the few instances that I have, the atmosphere between us has been noticeably different. I understand the reasons for her leaving the country she was in, but I feel as though my father took it for granted that my fiancée and I, who are just starting our own lives together, would step up to the plate to support her whilst he moves to another country to start a new life for himself. As terrible as I feel for her, it's not a burden that we are in a position to take on, even if she is family. Am I/my fiancée the asshole in all of this?

Answer the following question: -  Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process described, in which a plant takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment to form glucose and release oxygen, pertains to a biological mechanism called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a series of complex biochemical reactions that allow plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy is stored in glucose and other organic molecules, which are synthesized from water and carbon dioxide. The entire process can be broken down into several stages, with each stage representing an integral aspect of photosynthesis. The first step of photosynthesis is the absorption of light energy by specialized pigments found in the plant's cells, mainly chlorophyll. These pigments are primarily present in structures called chloroplasts, which are located in the plant's leaves and other green tissues. Chloroplasts are the main sites of photosynthesis where the entire series of reactions take place. When sunlight - comprised of photons or packets of energy - reaches the plant's surface, chlorophyll molecules absorb the light energy. This absorption excites the electrons within the chlorophyll, raising them to a higher energy state. This energy is then harnessed in the subsequent reactions. In summary, the first step of the process where plants take in water and carbon dioxide from their surroundings to form glucose and subsequently release oxygen is known as photosynthesis. Within this process, the initial phase consists of light energy absorption by chlorophyll molecules present in the chloroplasts, a specialized cellular structure found in plants. This absorbed energy sets the stage for the upcoming series of chemical reactions that take place during photosynthesis, ultimately leading to the production of glucose and the release of oxygen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A conference call is a telephone or video call that involves multiple participants who can speak and listen to each other at the same time. These calls are often used for business meetings, presentations, or project-based discussions, as they allow individuals from different locations to efficiently communicate and share information. Examining the other options, we can see why they do not fit the situation described: - Desktop: A desktop generally refers to a personal computer or workstation at a fixed location, equipped with a graphical user interface and applications. It does not refer to a type of call where several people can be heard over speakers. - Headphones: Headphones are a personal audio device worn on or around the ears, which allow individuals to listen to audio privately without disturbing others. While headphones can be used during a conference call, they do not define the type of call itself. - Connect: Connect is a vague term that can refer to establishing a link or communication between devices, systems, or people. It does not specifically identify a call where several people can be heard over speakers. - Concert: A concert is a live performance of music by one or more artists or musicians, typically attended by an audience. Although concerts often use speakers to amplify the sound of the performance, they are not a form of call like a conference call.

(Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Sidney K. \\"Sid\\" Meier (born February 24, 1954) is a programmer, designer, and producer of several popular strategy video games and simulation video games, most notably the \\"Civilization\\" series.

In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.  - MOS Technology, Inc. (\\"MOS\\" being short for Metal Oxide Semiconductor), also known as CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group), was a semiconductor design and fabrication company based in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the United States.

It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.  - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features.  - Star Raiders is a space combat simulator video game for the Atari 8-bit family of computers. It was written by Doug Neubauer, an Atari employee, and released in cartridge form by Atari in 1979. It was later ported to other Atari computer and game platforms.  - Strategy video games are a video game genre that focuses on skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory. It emphasizes strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges. Many games also offer economic challenges and exploration. They are generally categorized into four sub-types, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time, and whether the game focuses on strategy or tactics.  - MicroProse was an American video game publisher and developer founded by \\"Wild\\" Bill Stealey and Sid Meier in 1982 as MicroProse Software Inc. It developed and published numerous games, many of which are regarded as groundbreaking, classics and cult titles, including starting the \\"Civilization\\" and \\"X-COM\\" series. Most of their internally developed titles were vehicle simulation and strategy games.  - NATO Commander is a commercial computer strategy game designed by Sid Meier and released in 1983 by MicroProse . The game ran on 8 - bit home computers of its day such as the Atari 8 - bit family , Apple II and Commodore 64 . The player takes the roll of the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe as they respond to a massive Warsaw Pact attack . The goal is to slow their advance and inflict casualties , hoping to force a diplomatic end to the war before West Germany is overrun . The same game engine was also used as the basis for Conflict in Vietnam , Crusade in Europe and Decision in the Desert .  - The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market  branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists.   - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.  - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek  \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The MOS Technology 6502 (typically \\"\\"sixty-five-oh-two\\"\\" or \\"\\"six-five-oh-two\\"\\") is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as Motorola and Intel, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the Zilog Z80 it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s.  - Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for 500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.  - A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e.g. video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree style thinking, and typically very high situational awareness.

Information:  - The Kotmale River ( Sinhalese :   ) is the longest tributary of Mahaweli River . The river begins as the Agra Oya , in the Horton Plains . The Central Plains have an annual rainfall of between 125 and 200 inches a year . The river is approximately 70 km ( 43 mi ) long and drains a basin of about 58,534 ha ( 226 square miles ) . The river flows through a traditional area of ancient villages and tea plantations . King Dutugemunu spent his youth here . The Kotmale Oya flows into the Mahaweli shortly at Pallegama . Tributaries of the Kotmale Oya include the Nanu Oya , the Pundal Oya , the Puna Oya , and the Dambagastalawa Oya . The river was dammed between 1979 and 1985 as part of a hydro - electric project within the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga scheme . The opening ceremony took place in August 1985 . Some 3,000 families had to be relocated top higher ground . The area has a history of geological instability .  - The Bay of Bengal, the largest bay in the world, forms the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean. Roughly triangular, it is bordered mostly by India and Sri Lanka to the west, Bangladesh to the north, and Myanmar (Burma) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) to the east.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity, and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.  - The Mahaweli River (Mahawaluka nadee, literally \\"Great Sandy River\\"; [\\"mahawali gangai\\"]), is a long river, ranking as the longest river in Sri Lanka. Its drainage basin is the largest in the country, and covers almost one-fifth of the total area of the island. The real creation of Mahaweli ganga starts at Polwathura(at Mahawila area), a remote village of Nuwara-Eliya District in bank Nawalapitiya of Kandy District by further joining of Hatton oya and Kotmale oya.The river reaches the Bay of Bengal on the southwestern side of Trincomalee Bay. The bay includes the first of a number submarine canyons, making Trincomalee one of the finest deep-sea harbors in the world. The river and its tributaries are dammed at several locations to allow irrigation in the dry zone, with almost of land irrigated. Production of hydroelectricity from six dams of the Mahaweli system supplies more than 40% of Sri Lanka's electricity needs. One of the many sources of the river is the Kotmale Oya.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

The native of Knoxville, Tenn., was captured in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and held at German POW camp Staleg IXA, according to Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum. When the Nazis ordered all Jewish-American POWs to step forward on Jan. 27, 1945, Edmonds—the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer at the camp—ordered 1,000 US soldiers to do so, regardless of their religion, per the AP. \\"They cannot all be Jews!\\" a German commander said, per Yad Vashem. \\"We are all Jews here,\\" Edmonds replied, adding soldiers didn't need to divulge their religion under the Geneva Conventions. The commander then put a gun to Edmonds' head. He said, \\"'I'll give you one more chance. Have the Jewish men step forward or I will shoot you on the spot,'\\" Edmonds' son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, tells NPR. \\"They said my dad paused, and said, 'If you shoot, you'll have to shoot us all.'\\" The commander yielded. Chris Edmonds believes his dad's move saved 200 lives. Edmonds died in 1985 and his untold story nearly died with him. How it surfaced is fascinating: Some time after his father's death, Chris Edmonds read an article about Richard Nixon's purchase of a tony Manhattan townhouse from a man named Lester Tanner—who mentioned that Edmonds saved his life. The son then embarked on a quest to find Tanner. Edmonds was honored on Wednesday as only the fifth American to receive the Israeli honor, the country's highest for non-Jews who undertook heroic acts in WWII. He is now being considered for a Medal of Honor.

Edmonds was captured during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and held at German POW camp Stalag IXA. I. Defying the Nazis Orders In January 27, 1945, the Nazis ordered all Jewish-American POWs to step forward during a roll call. Edmonds, being the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer at the camp, made a daring decision to order 1,000 US soldiers to step forward, regardless of their religion. The German commander was shocked and said, \\"They cannot all be Jews!\\" Edmonds replied confidently, \\"We are all Jews here.\\" II. Standing up for the Geneva Conventions Edmonds further argued that the soldiers did not need to divulge their religion under the Geneva Conventions rules. Frustrated, the German commander put a gun to Edmonds' head and threatened to shoot him if he did not order the Jewish soldiers to step forward. Edmonds answered, \\"If you shoot, you'll have to shoot us all.\\" As a result, the commander backed down, and Edmonds' courageous act saved the lives of 200 Jewish men. III. The Untold Story of Roddie Edmonds Unfortunately, Edmonds passed away in 1985, and his incredible story was nearly lost forever. However, his son, Rev. Chris Edmonds, came across an article about Lester Tanner, a man who mentioned that Edmonds had saved his life. This discovery prompted Chris Edmonds to embark on a journey to find Tanner and eventually led to the recognition of his father's heroism. IV. Roddie Edmonds' Legacy On Wednesday, Roddie Edmonds was honored as only the fifth American to receive Israel's Righteous Among the Nations honor, the highest recognition for non-Jews who undertook heroic acts in World War II. He is now being considered for a Medal of Honor as well. Conclusion: Roddie Edmonds' story is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right. His unwavering bravery and defiance of Nazi orders saved countless lives and solidify his place in history as an American hero."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Joan Alexandra Molinsky (June 8, 1933 - September 4, 2014), professional name Joan Rivers, was an American stand-up comedian, actress, writer, producer, and television host. She was noted for her often controversial comedic persona--heavily self-deprecating or sharply acerbic, especially toward celebrities and politicians. Rivers rose to prominence in 1965 as a guest on The Tonight Show. Hosted by her mentor, Johnny Carson, the show established Rivers' comedic style. In addition to winning the Emmy for The Joan Rivers Show, Rivers starred in the made-for-television comedy How to Murder a Millionaire, which premiered in May 1990 on CBS. In the film, co-starring Alex Rocco and Telma Hopkins, she took on the role of a Beverly Hills matron possessed with the idea her husband is trying to kill her. Also in 1990, she started to design jewelry, clothing and beauty products for the shopping channel QVC. On this professional endeavor, Rivers said: \\"In those days, only dead celebrities went on [QVC]. My career was over. I had bills to pay. [...] It also intrigued me at the beginning\\". The sales of Rivers' products exceed 1 billion by 2014, making her one of the network's top sellers. In 1991, she wrote her next book, Still Talking, which described the cancellation of her late-night show and her husband's suicide. Until 1993, she received five addicional Emmy nominations for her daytime talk-show The Joan Rivers Show -- two for Outstanding Writing - Special Class and three for Outstanding Talk Show Host.  In 1994, Rivers and daughter Melissa first hosted the E! Entertainment Television pre-awards show for the Golden Globe Awards, and beginning in 1995, E!'s annual Academy Awards pre-awards show as well. Rivers and her daughter quickly became credited for revolutionizing the red carpet as a space to showcase designers' work and celebrity interactions. \\"Joan and Melissa were the first people who came out and made it more of a true conversation between star and reporter\\", E!'s Senior Vice President of production, Gary Snegaroff, remarked to Vanity Fair. \\"They asked about what [actresses] were wearing because that's what the magazines would cover after the fact, and turned it into a candid conversation on the carpet where anything could happen\\". Rivers and Melissa, at the time, both portrayed themselves in the made-for-television drama Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story, which chronicled the aftermath of Rosenburg's suicide. It aired on NBC on May 15, 1994. The next year, she wrote her book Jewelry by Joan Rivers.  Influenced by the stand-up comedy of Lenny Bruce, Rivers co-wrote and starred in a play about Bruce's mother Sally Marr, who was also a stand-up comic and influenced her son's development as a comic. After 27 previews, Sally Marr ... and Her Escorts, a play \\"suggested by the life of Sally Marr\\" ran on Broadway for 50 performances in May and June 1994. The production received mixed reviews, but her performance was applauded by critics. The Chicago Sun Times found Rivers to be \\"compelling\\" as an actress while The New York Times wrote: \\"[...] [S]he is exuberant, fearless and inexhaustible. If you admire performers for taking risks, then you can't help but applaud her efforts\\". Rivers was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actress in a Play and a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for playing Marr. Beginning in 1997, Rivers hosted her own radio show on WOR in New York City, and wrote three self-help books: Bouncing Back: I've Survived Everything ... and I Mean Everything ... and You Can Too! in 1997, From Mother to Daughter: Thoughts and Advice on Life, Love and Marriage in 1998, and Don't Count the Candles: Just Keep the Fire Lit!, in 1999.","output":"This text is about Joan Alexandra Molinsky, who was professionally known as Joan Rivers.

Sentence: \\"Quickly walks went to the store.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely not rate the given sentence \\"Quickly walks went to the store\\" to be acceptable linguistically due to several reasons. To understand why, let's analyze the sentence and identify its grammatical issues. 1. Word order: In English, the typical sentence structure follows the subject-verb-object order (SVO). The given sentence appears to combine a subject (\\"walks\\"), a verb (\\"went\\"), and a destination (\\"to the store\\") in a nonstandard way. A more appropriate sentence might start with the subject, e.g., \\"someone,\\" followed by a verb and then the object. 2. Verb tense and form inconsistency: The verb \\"went\\" is in the past simple tense but is used alongside \\"walks,\\" which is present simple. Mixing tenses in this manner is not considered grammatically correct. The verb should be consistent, either entirely in the present simple (e.g., \\"someone walks\\") or the past simple tense (e.g., \\"someone walked\\"). 3. Verb and subject agreement: The subject \\"walks\\" is a third person singular conjugation of the verb \\"to walk\\" and serves as a verb rather than a subject in this context. A linguistically acceptable sentence would require a clear subject, such as \\"he,\\" \\"she,\\" or \\"someone.\\" 4. Adverb placement: The adverb \\"quickly\\" is placed before \\"walks,\\" which makes it unclear whether it should modify the verb \\"walks\\" or \\"went.\\" A more appropriate use of the adverb would be to place it before the main verb (e.g., \\"He quickly walked\\"). Considering these issues, a linguist would not rate the initial sentence as linguistically acceptable. A corrected version of the sentence might be: \\"Someone quickly walked to the store.\\" This revised sentence follows the subject-verb-object structure, uses consistent verb tense, has a clear subject, and places the adverb in the appropriate position to modify the main verb. Consequently, this sentence would likely be considered linguistically acceptable by a linguist."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's the equation: -8073 = 4 * m - 8049 To solve for 'm', we need to follow these steps: 1. Add 8049 to both sides of the equation to remove the number from the right side. We get: -8073 + 8049 = 4 * m - 8049 + 8049 This simplifies to: -24 = 4 * m 2. Now, we need to figure out what number 'm' times 4 will give us -24. To find 'm', we'll divide both sides by 4: (-24) / 4 = 4 * m / 4 This gives us: -6 = m So, the answer is m = -6, which means if we multiply -6 by 4 and subtract 8049, we'll get -8073."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Desperate to avoid paying overdue rent, Mark continually eludes landlord Jack, meaning he is also unable to inform Jack of the flat's dilapidated state. Discovering that Mark wasted money meant for the overdue rent, Sally finally decides to end her strained relationship with Mark, informs Jack of the repairs needed, and arranges to move out. The damaged state of the flat reaching its peak, Mark witnesses two consecutive freak accidents; a bookshelf falls and kills his dog, and the living room chandelier collapses and crushes David.

His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\". Schinder and Schwartz call him \\"a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.\\" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's role playing is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics \\"arrest our ear, without question.

Prison officials are searching for a 49-year-old escaped inmate who fled the Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County. James Murray, an inmate firefighter, was last observed on Friday night in his dorm room in Yuicaipa, reports NBC. Murray is white, has short brown hair, and stands 5 feet 9 inches tall. James Murray, 49, escaped from Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County yesterday and authorities are still attempting to capture him. Murray was imprisoned for second-degree burglary and has been in prison since Oct 25, 2012, said the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The Mail Online spoke with Sgt. F. Martinez who said that they have not yet captured Murray but have been adamantly searching for him. They had a dog team scout for Murray's scent which they followed to a nearby highway leading them to believe that Murray may have entered a vehicle and drove off. They also had a helicopter circle the area to look for additional clues. Martinez said that as of 12:45 today they suspended the foot search for Murray and will work with undercover agents who monitor phone calls or any possible contact with friends or family members. Inmate firefighters like Murray fight wild land fire along with non incarcerated firefighters as part of Oak Glen's fire crews and program aimed at lowering prison recidivism rates. Each crew consists of 16 inmates and one inmate fire captain.

In Kosovo, over 30 Islamic civil society organizations are currently active, contributing to various aspects of social life in the country. These organizations are engaged in a range of activities, including providing religious education, promoting Islamic values, offering financial support to the economically disadvantaged, and contributing to conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts. Islamic civil society organizations in Kosovo have emerged to address the unique needs and challenges faced by the Muslim community in the region. This has been particularly important in the context of Kosovo's complex history and its development as a multiethnic and multireligious society. These organizations serve as a critical platform for individuals to engage with their faith, connect with other community members, and contribute positively to their society. A key aspect of these organizations' work is in the field of education. Many Islamic organizations in Kosovo operate Islamic schools and educational centers that focus on providing instruction in Islamic studies, Arabic language, and other related subjects. These institutions seek to ensure that young people in the community have access to the knowledge they need to understand and practice their faith. Another critical area of focus for Islamic civil society organizations in Kosovo is poverty alleviation and providing assistance to those in need. Through various programs and initiatives, these organizations seek to offer financial support and other resources to individuals who are economically disadvantaged. This can include initiatives such as charitable giving (zakat), providing food and other necessities to those in need, and setting up microcredit programs to help people establish sustainable livelihoods. In addition to addressing the needs of the Muslim community in Kosovo, these Islamic civil society organizations often actively engage in broader efforts to promote peace and coexistence in the country. They work to facilitate dialogue between different religious and ethnic groups, encourage tolerance and understanding, and contribute to the development of a more inclusive and diverse society. This can involve participation in interfaith forums, training programs focused on conflict resolution, and other efforts aimed at fostering social cohesion. Overall, the presence of more than 30 active Islamic civil society organizations in Kosovo highlights the diverse and dynamic contributions that these groups are making not only to the well-being of the Muslim community but also to the broader development of the nation.

However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the \\"broken blossom\\" Lucy Burrows (Lillian Gish), the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows (Donald Crisp). After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng's home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop.

Hypothesis: The Bronx Legal Services were in distress by the charges. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise states that Bronx Legal Services (BLS) experienced distress over changes to their program structure, which is evidenced by their decision to file a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York in an effort to block the restructuring. This action indicates the organization's strong emotional response (distress) and determination to fight against the proposed changes, as litigation usually represents a significant investment of both time and resources. The hypothesis, stating that \\"The Bronx Legal Services were in distress by the charges,\\" aligns with and is essentially a simpler rephrasing of the premise. Both statements convey the same idea: BLS experiences a high level of discomfort or emotional strain due to the changes to their program's structure. Consequently, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, given that they convey the same core information and meaning. It is important to note that in addressing questions pertaining to entailment, one should evaluate whether the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is logical and necessary, meaning that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true.

He quickly realized that, unlike the chilly outdoors, the room was warm and cozy. The air smelled of warm spices and the walls were adorned with soft golden lights. He looked around, taking in the sight of the beautifully designed space. His eyes were drawn to a large fireplace that filled the room with a comforting warmth. The crackling sound of burning logs echoed around the room, filling the atmosphere with an entrancing melody. A lush carpet covered the floor, hugging his feet as he took each step towards the fire. The warm crimson hue of the wallpaper created a calming aura. On the other side of the room, a large window framed the breathtaking view of snow-covered trees that filled the front yard. The snowflakes falling outside added a magical touch to the already serene winter scene. Despite the cold beyond the window, the warmth in the room enveloped John in a comforting hug. As he moved towards the center of the room, he noticed a large bookshelf filled with books, some seemingly antique, their spines showcasing a beautiful gold embossing. A large and worn leather armchair sat beside a small round table with a steaming mug of hot chocolate, the aroma wafting through the air and inviting John to take a seat. Deciding to indulge himself, John picked up a book, its pages smelling of times long past. He settled into that old leather armchair, which seemed to have perfectly conformed to the contour of his body. He sipped the hot chocolate thoughtfully, savoring the warmth that spread across his chest, banishing any remnants of the outdoor chill. A majestic grandfather clock stood in one corner of the room, its pendulum swaying with an almost imperceptible sound. John admired the craftsmanship and the intricate carvings of the wooden clock. It seemed to hold secrets of a bygone era, patiently waiting to share its tales with anyone willing to listen. John became completely absorbed in the story, feeling a calm sense of contentment. The fireplace continued to warm the room, casting flickering shadows that danced in harmony with the snowflakes outside. Hours passed in this oasis of warmth, with the wintery world around him frozen in time. As the evening wore on, John realized that he was not alone in the house. He could hear faint noises coming from the kitchen – the sizzle of a pan, the clanking of utensils, and the muted laughter of his friends who had gathered for a weekend getaway. They were busy preparing a meal, their conversations punctuated with warm laughter. Soon, John would leave the comfort of his warm room and venture into the welcoming arms of his friends. They shared stories and laughter as they enjoyed their meal. On this cold winter’s night, the warmth of the room and the genuine connection they shared kept the chill at bay, and John could not have been more grateful for the magic of the warm room."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Mohr Davidow Ventures -  Mohr Davidow Ventures is a venture capital firm that invests in early stage technology companies.

The street where they found her had been her home for many years. Her parents were unknown. They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else-to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \\"My English just wasn't good enough.\\" she says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management  at Hong Kong Polytechnic and graduated in 1980. She started her own business in 1985.

Article:It was revealed during a High Court hearing in Belfast which had been due to decide whether the department had to publish the guidelines. The attorney general said there was now no reason to proceed with the hearing. Unlike the rest of the UK abortion is only allowed in very restricted circumstances in Northern Ireland. The judicial review in the High Court was sought by the Family Planning Association (FPA) which has been campaigning for more than a decade for guidelines to be issued on the law on abortion. The organisation received a letter from the office of the Health Minister Edwin Poots on Tuesday night which confirmed his decision to put proposals to the ministerial Executive in Belfast by 7 March. He will submit a paper seeking approval to consult on a version of the guidance on termination of pregnancy. Outside court Audrey Simpson, chief executive of the FPA in Northern Ireland, called for guidance to be issued urgently, and said it was unfortunate it had to resort to legal action. In a statement issued through her solicitors she said: \\"The action now promised by the department is something that should have happened many years ago. \\"It's essential that the guidance should contain clear pathways for referrals for women and directions for aftercare services which is essentially what these proceedings were all about.\\" After previous legal action by the charity, the Department of Health in Stormont issued a 20-page document in 2009 containing guidance for health professionals on the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland. It was withdrawn the following year after a successful legal challenge by anti-abortion campaigners led to a ruling that sections on counselling and conscientious objection should be rewritten. Meanwhile, two Stormont assembly members are attempting to change the law to make it illegal to perform an abortion outside the NHS. It follows the opening of the private Marie Stopes International clinic in Belfast last year. The DUP's Paul Givan, who chairs the justice committee, and the SDLP's Alban Maginness have tabled a joint amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill. The laws covering abortion in Northern Ireland are the 1861 Offences against the Person Act,  and the Criminal Justice act from 1945.  It is a criminal offence, which carries a life sentence. The only exceptions are to save a woman's life, or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Last year official figures confirmed that at least 40 terminations a year are carried out on these grounds. More than a thousand women a year who don't fit in these categories travel from Northern Ireland each year to have an abortion in other parts of the UK. In England, Wales and Scotland access to abortion is covered by the 1967 Abortion Act.  That permits terminations up to 24 weeks of pregnancy on grounds which include risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or existing children in the family, and abnormalities which could lead to a child being \\"seriously handicapped\\". It is also allowed over 24 weeks if a woman's life or health is at serious risk and for serious disabilities. Abortion remains a sensitive issue everywhere, but is significantly more controversial in Northern Ireland.  The opening of a Marie Stopes clinic led to demonstrations and scrutiny by a committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly. For that reason it is quite possible that any guidance could face further legal challenges. Speaking before the department's announcement, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (Spuc) said in a statement:  \\"By taking this legal action the FPA has demonstrated a growing frustration at its own lack of success in winning support for its agenda. Despite its efforts abortion in Northern Ireland remains a criminal offence. \\"In trying to force the Department of Health to publish guidelines the FPA is actually attempting to medicalise the issue of abortion. The law, however, is perfectly clear and requires no guidance. \\"Besides, any guidance which accurately reflected the law would not be acceptable to the FPA because it refuses to recognise the limitations within the current law. \\" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said its members were working from the earlier draft guidelines, described by government officials as having \\"no status\\". The college said it hoped the judicial review \\"will lead to more clarity for professionals and better care for women residing in this part of the United Kingdom\\". There are some parallels between the legal battle in Northern Ireland and the debate in the Republic of Ireland, where abortion is even more restricted and is only permitted if there is a \\"real and substantial\\" risk to the woman's life. The European Court of Human Rights said in a 2010 judgement that there were no clear criteria in the Irish Republic to apply to the case of any individual woman. Like the UK, the Irish Republic is signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights. The death of Savita Halappanavar in a hospital in Galway in October last year hit the headlines around the world and reignited the debate.  Her family said she asked for a termination when she began miscarrying but was refused, a decision they argued led to her death several days later. An inquest into the death of the 31-year-old dentist is due to be held in April. After taking advice from an expert panel the Irish government has said it is drafting legislation to address the European ruling and expects to be in a position to publish that in the next few months. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the issue of abortion in Northern Ireland, where it is only allowed in very restricted circumstances, unlike the rest of the UK.

The venue marks its 250th anniversary this year and wants to raise funds for the next phase of its redevelopment. Ms Bond, who played Lady Rosamund in Downton Abbey, said: \\"We need to raise a bit more money and that's it sorted.\\" The Old Vic opened in 1766 and claims to be the UK's oldest working theatre. It was closed for an 18-month refurbishment between 2010 and 2012 and is currently raising £12.5m to transform its front of house spaces. Ms Bond, a former theatre student, said it was \\"the most beautiful theatre to play\\". \\"It's a bit like playing to a very warm armchair - the auditorium envelops the audience and makes it an absolute joy for the actor,\\" she said. Stephanie Cole, who starred in Tenko and Coronation Street, also began her career at the Old Vic. \\"The first time I stood on the stage and was paid for it was here - when I was 17,\\" she said. \\"And when I finished at the Vic School I joined the company for a year - it is the most wonderful theatre.  What can I say it's a jewel - it's magic.\\" Greta Scacchi, best known for her lead role in the film White Mischief, also described the theatre as a \\"place of magic\\". \\"It's fortunate Bristol not only has this theatre - this historic jewel of an auditorium - but that it's in a city of this size where it's a focal point and people can feel very proud of it,\\" she said.

Read this and answer the question During the rule of the Fatimid and Mamluk dynasties and their successor states in the medieval Middle East, many of the ruling elite founded madaris through a religious endowment known as the waqf. Not only was the madrasa a potent symbol of status but it was an effective means of transmitting wealth and status to their descendants. Especially during the Mamlūk period, when only former slaves could assume power, the sons of the ruling Mamlūk elite were unable to inherit. Guaranteed positions within the new madaris thus allowed them to maintain status. Madaris built in this period include the Mosque-Madrasah of Sultan Ḥasan in Cairo. Which class of people founded the madaris during the medieval period?","output":"During the medieval period in the Middle East, the ruling elite class, specifically under the rule of the Fatimid and Mamluk dynasties and their successor states, founded the madaris.

Brum need just one point from their last two games, starting at Brighton this afternoon, to seal a spot in the end-of-term shootout. But Scot Burke is still haunted by final-day dejection with the Bluebirds in 2008-09. Cardiff were expected to walk into the semi-finals until a defeat on the last day of the campaign against Sheffield Wednesday cost them a crack at the £90million Premier League prize. So Burke warned: “Everybody is saying to me we’re nearly there — but we can’t take anything for granted. I should know, trust me. I’ll never forget the first season at Cardiff and we were all flying and looking like we would get a top-six finish. “We ended up missing out by one goal scored and Preston took the place from us.

He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature?

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park (home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) and parks in a space that had been blocked off to keep cars from parking too close to some construction materials. He oddly puts a quarter in the parking meter for thirty minutes parking, then positions himself and his sniper rifle behind the front facing wall of the garage. He rises up over the edge of the wall and starts scanning the area along the North Shore Trail (between the stadium and the Allegheny River) with the scope on the rifle. Finally he takes aim and starts firing, killing a man sitting on a bench, then a woman in a business suit carrying a briefcase up some stairs, a blond woman carrying a shopping bag on the walking path, another woman who has seen the others go down and is simply trying to run away, and finally a young woman also hurrying to get away while carrying a little girl. The shooter then jumps back in the van and flees.The police arrive, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and after determining there's no suspects around, they begin assessing the crime scene. Emerson discovers a shell casing lying in a crack on the garage floor, and he also decides to empty the parking meter. A fingerprint taken from a quarter in the meter is determined to belong to a James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. The police raid Barr's house and find him sleeping. They also find the van (recorded on a security camera entering and leaving the parking garage), equipment for precision hand loading of ammunition (not making bullets as stated in movie), and a sniper rifle.When Barr is encouraged to confess during his interrogation by Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), he writes on a notepad the words, \\"Get Jack Reacher.\\" It's determined that Reacher is a former U.S. Army Military Police officer who's been out of contact with the world for the past two years. Rodin asks Emerson how they might be able to find... Answer:","output":"\\"Crosshairs on the Riverfront: A Jack Reacher Mystery\\" The title \\"Crosshairs on the Riverfront: A Jack Reacher Mystery\\" encapsulates both the thrilling atmosphere and the central protagonist of this film. The sniper aiming his rifle as he overlooks the North Shore Trail draws the viewer into the tense and thrilling premise of this sniper on the loose. With the focus on the Allegheny River and the PNC Park area, the title immediately calls to mind the iconic visual of Pittsburgh's waterfront and its significance in the movie. As the movie unfolds and the police become more involved, the introduction of Jack Reacher as a critical figure in the case adds another layer to the title. By incorporating Jack Reacher's name into the title, it highlights the importance of his character and the mystery surrounding him as a key piece of the puzzle. The title also hints at the concept of a mystery that must be solved, with Reacher potentially operating as the only person capable of unraveling the tangled web of deception, guilt, and hidden motives. Emphasizing the investigative aspect of the story, the title keeps the focus on the crime and the urgency of finding answers as the death toll rises. Furthermore, the theme of a military background pervades the movie, with both the suspected sniper, James Barr, and Jack Reacher having ties to the U.S. Army. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the title, as the audience is left to wonder what connections these two men may share - and how their mutual military past may factor into the all-encompassing mystery. In summary, \\"Crosshairs on the Riverfront: A Jack Reacher Mystery\\" creates an enticing movie title that successfully captures the suspenseful essence of this intricate sniper plot set in the city of Pittsburgh, while also highlighting the central role of Jack Reacher in the pursuit of the truth behind a series of seemingly unconnected murders."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Everyone knows that there's not enough land in Hong Kong.

Ted Cruz slammed the White House on Tuesday for a \\"failure of leadership\\" as President Barack Obama prepares to nominate his administration's fourth defense secretary.  The Texas Republican, who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own White House administration, called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the Defense Department emblematic of a White House that puts politics above U.S. national security.  \\"It seems what the administration is looking for is a defense secretary who will follow the orders of a political White House rather than focus on defending the national security interests of this country,\\" Cruz said. \\"At a time when the threats are this grave, we shouldn't see turnover at the Defense Department than one has at a typical Burger King.\\"  Cruz said he did not know Ashton Carter, the former No. 2 man at the Pentagon who is expected to be Obama's nominee to succeed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but Cruz said he looks forward to learning more about Carter and his \\"good reputation.\\"  But Cruz emphasized he was unsettled to see several potential picks pull their names out of the running to head the department, including former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed.  \\"It says something that so many people are saying, 'No, thank you, I don't want to serve in an administration that overrides the Defense Department, that treats the defense secretary as subservient to political lackeys in the White House,\\" Cruz said.  Cruz made the remarks Tuesday at an event cosponsored by Concerned Veterans of America and the conservative publication The Weekly Standard during which he bore out his hawkish foreign policy and staked out positions starkly in contrast to Obama.  1.

Help as much as you can. For a long time being happy was considered something that just happened, and there was nothing special about it. Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless   in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights  . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged   when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults   and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to   _  .

The best place to find bleachers inside is in a gymnasium. Bleachers are a type of seating arrangement consisting of tiered rows of benches, typically found in athletic facilities, where spectators can observe and support sporting events.  In the context of the options given, let's examine each one: 1. Soccer: Although soccer is a popular sporting event that often includes bleachers for spectator seating, these events are usually held outdoors on soccer fields rather than inside a building. In cases where an indoor soccer arena does exist, bleachers may be available. However, gymnasiums are more commonly associated with indoor bleachers. 2. Sporting event: While bleachers can be found at various indoor sporting events, this option is too broad and does not specify a specific location where the bleachers would be housed. Bleachers could be found in swimming pools, basketball courts, or even wrestling venues, which makes this option less accurate in pinpointing a specific indoor location for bleachers. 3. Pharmacy: Bleachers are not commonly found in pharmacies as these are establishments focused on providing medications, health products, and other related services. Pharmacies do not generally have a need for spectator seating arrangements. 4. Gymnasium: As mentioned earlier, gymnasiums are typically where you would find bleachers inside. These large indoor spaces are designed to accommodate various sports and recreational activities, such as basketball, volleyball, and other court-based games. Bleachers are a standard feature in gymnasiums, allowing spectators to comfortably watch and support the athletes during games and events. 5. Seat with a view: This phrase does not specifically indicate a location but rather describes the purpose of bleachers – providing spectators with a proper vantage point from which to view the event. This option does not provide a precise answer as to where one would find bleachers inside. In conclusion, gymnasiums are the best answer to the question of where one would find bleachers inside, given the options provided. Gymnasiums are specifically built to accommodate sports events and other physical activities, and bleachers are a common fixture in these venues, providing seating for spectators to support and enjoy the events taking place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Movingtoaservicesmodelalsomovesspendingfromcapextoopex,whichmaybeusefulforsomecompanies.","output":"Moving to a service model also moves spending from capex to opex, which may be useful for some companies. In recent years, many organizations have begun moving towards a service-based model, which involves shifting from traditional capital expenditures (capex) to operating expenditures (opex). This can be highly beneficial for several reasons, providing companies with greater flexibility, cost management, and scalability opportunities. Capital expenditures (capex) refer to the funds spent by a company on acquiring or upgrading physical assets such as property, equipment, or technology. These are typically one-time, large-scale investments that can involve significant upfront costs. Capex often has a long-term outlook, with assets depreciating over time and providing value to the company for an extended period. However, these investments often require substantial financial planning and a considerable amount of time to generate returns. Operating expenditures (opex) are the ongoing costs incurred during the regular course of business operations. These can include salaries, utility bills, maintenance, and other expenses associated with day-to-day activities. Unlike capex, these costs are typically smaller, easier to predict and manage, and directly linked to a company's profitability. Shifting from capex to opex can have several advantages for organizations: 1. Agility and flexibility: Using a service-based model allows a company to stay agile and adapt to market changes more quickly. This is especially important in today's rapidly-evolving business landscape, where the ability to pivot and respond to new trends can make or break a venture. 2. Reduced upfront costs: Moving to an opex-based model eliminates the need for large upfront investments in fixed assets. Instead, companies can rely on third-party providers to access the resources they need, effectively converting a traditionally fixed cost into a more manageable variable cost. 3. Improved cost management: Operating expenditures are generally easier to estimate and manage than capital expenditures. With a service-based model, businesses can plan for and control their expenses more effectively, reducing the risk of budget overruns and unexpected costs. 4. Scalability: As a company expands or contracts, the resources required to support the business also need to scale accordingly. With a service-based model, it is easier to scale resources up or down to match fluctuating needs, without incurring additional infrastructure costs. 5. Access to cutting-edge technology: By utilizing service providers, organizations gain access to the latest technology, systems, and expertise without having to invest in expensive hardware and software upgrades. 6. Focus on core business: Lastly, outsourcing non-core activities allows a company to concentrate on its primary objectives, improving productivity and overall business performance. In conclusion, the move from a capex-based model to an opex-based, service-driven approach can provide numerous advantages for companies. By eliminating large upfront investments, improving cost management, enabling better scalability, and allowing access to the latest technologies, businesses can remain agile and focused in a competitive market landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II? , can you please find it?   MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who was a paratrooper during World War II in this article is MSgt Mike Takashima."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Cruel Mel Gibson paying nothing towards his baby girl's upkeep says ex-lover Oksana Grigorieva            By Caroline Graham      Last updated at 10:53 PM on 26th June 2010      The mother of Mel Gibson’s love child last night hit out at the multi-millionaire actor, saying he is paying no child support for their nine-month-old daughter Lucia.      Russian musician Oksana Grigorieva, 40, claims she has had to borrow money from friends because of the ‘cruelty’ of the 54-year-old Lethal Weapon star, who is worth an estimated £600 million.      Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks, Miss Grigorieva said: ‘He is not paying me a penny. Nothing.            Living on borrowed money: Oksana Grigorieva, ex-girlfriend of Mel Gibson, shops for supplies at the supermarket yesterday      'There are so many lies being said about me. I was trying to keep things dignified and be respectful to the father of my daughter, but what he is doing is cruelty.            'I am having to live on credit cards and borrowed money. It is not a good situation.’            Happier times: the couple last year      Gibson split with Robyn, his wife of 28 years and mother of his seven older children, in April last year, just days after being pictured kissing Miss Grigorieva on a Costa Rican beach. But the new relationship fell apart two months ago in a bitter split.      Miss Grigorieva said: ‘We were together for three years. So much that is being put out there is wrong.            'He didn’t dump me, I left him. I rescued my children and myself.’      On Friday a US website claimed Gibson had taken out a restraining order against Moscow-born Miss Grigorieva.      But she insisted: ‘There is no restraining order against me, but my lawyers went to court and a judge granted a restraining order against him.’            A clerk at Los Angeles Superior Court confirmed the restraining order against Gibson had been filed but added that the case would be heard by a judge sitting in camera this week.            Miss Grigorieva, who also has a 13-year-old son Alexander with former James Bond actor Timothy Dalton, added: ‘The truth will come out eventually. There are custody issues. What is happening to me is not fair.’      A source close to Miss Grigorieva, who met Gibson when she signed to the music division of his production company, said: ‘She feels vulnerable up against the might of the Mel Gibson machine’      Mr Gibson’s spokesman last night declined to comment about Miss Grigorieva’s claims.

Information:  - Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders.  - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.  - Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logic, analytics, and experience to determine \\"cause and effect\\". In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions.  - A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other articlewhether used alone or in combination, including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper applicationintended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of:  - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).  - In medicine , a nebulizer or nebuliser ( see spelling differences ) is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs . Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis , asthma , COPD and other respiratory diseases . Analytical nebulizers are another form of nebulizer and are used primarily in laboratory settings for elemental analysis . Nebulizers use oxygen , compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device . The definition of an aerosol is a \`\` mixture of gas and liquid particles , '' and the best example of a naturally occurring aerosol is mist , formed when small vaporized water particles mixed with hot ambient air are cooled down and condense into a fine cloud of visible airborne water droplets .  - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine.  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Health care or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in human beings. Health care is delivered by health professionals (providers or practitioners) in allied health professions, chiropractic, physicians, physician associates, dentistry, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, psychology, and other health professions. It includes the work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.    What is the relationship between 'nebulizer' and 'medical device'?

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Paragraph: Two students read about reproduction for biology class. Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about female fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water?

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Houston, 1913, nine-year-old Howard Hughes is warned by his mother of the diseases to which she is afraid he will succumb. Fourteen years later, he begins to direct the movie Hell's Angels. However, after the release of The Jazz Singer, the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders the film to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn, who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer, pushing it to a new speed record. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, aggravating Juan Trippe, company rival and chairman of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). Trippe gets his friend, Senator Owen Brewster, to introduce the Community Airline Bill, giving Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. As Hughes' fame grows, he is linked to various starlets, causing a jealous Hepburn to break up with him following her announcement that she has fallen in love with fellow actor Spencer Tracy. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue, and later actress Ava Gardner. Hughes secures a contract with the Army Air Forces for two projects: a spy aircraft and a troop transport unit. In 1946, with the \\"Spruce Goose\\" flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and the aircraft crashes in Beverly Hills, with Hughes getting severely injured.

Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.

Firstly, let's break down the two statements to understand the individual elements involved: Statement 1: \\"A group of people in a blurry photo are standing in concentric circles and clapping.\\" This statement gives us several pieces of information: 1. There is a group of people. 2. They are in a blurry photo. 3. They are standing in concentric circles. 4. They are clapping. Statement 2: \\"A group of people are clapping.\\" This statement only tells us two things: 1. There is a group of people. 2. They are clapping. Now, let's attempt to deduce if the premise in Statement 1 is true based on the information in Statement 2. When comparing the two statements, we find two common elements: the presence of a group of people and the action of clapping. However, Statement 2 does not provide information about whether the group of people is in a blurry photo or if they are standing in concentric circles. In deductive reasoning, we must work with the information provided and avoid making assumptions. Given the limited information in Statement 2, we cannot conclusively determine that the premise in Statement 1 is true. To establish the premise as true or false, we would require additional information to either support or refute the presence of a blurry photo as well as the arrangement of people in concentric circles. Without such information, it is not possible to confirm or deny the validity of the premise \\"A group of people in a blurry photo are standing in concentric circles and clapping\\" based solely on the knowledge that \\"A group of people are clapping.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question:   Ollie is a rocket scientist and was testing missiles. Better missiles likely result in worse or better rockets? Answer:","output":"Better missiles are likely to result in better rockets, particularly when considering the shared history and technological advancements of both missile and rocket systems. From the onset, it is essential to understand that missiles and rockets share many similarities in design, operation, and purpose. Both systems utilize propulsion based on Newton's Third Law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Additionally, both technologies often require the control and guidance systems to reach their intended destinations. Given these parallels between missiles and rockets, it stands to reason that the development of better missiles has the potential to result in better rocket technologies. As a rocket scientist, Ollie is likely aware of these connections, and the work he conducts when testing missiles could have a direct influence on the ongoing advancements in rocket technology. Here are a few reasons why better missiles might contribute to better rockets: 1. Improved propulsion systems: When developing advanced missiles, engineers have to focus on increasing speed and range to evade modern defense systems. By continually improving missile propulsion mechanics, rocket scientists like Ollie can apply these advancements to rockets to achieve greater thrust, more efficient fuel consumption, and increased velocity while traveling through Earth's atmosphere or in space. 2. Enhanced guidance systems: Advanced missiles require sophisticated guidance and control systems to accurately target their destinations. These systems can be translated to rocket navigation, availing better accuracy, and precision during launches and space missions. 3. Increased reliability: Advanced missiles' development aims to improve reliability and reduce the possibility of failure during missions. This focus on reliability and safety would carry over to rocket systems, providing better outcomes for rocket missions. 4. Materials and technology: Developing better missiles often involves exploring new materials, components, and technology that can withstand the extreme conditions encountered during flight. These innovations could then be utilized for rockets, enhancing their structural integrity, reducing weight, and improving overall performance. 5. Knowledge and expertise sharing: A collaborative environment between the missile and rocket sectors allows for the sharing of knowledge, resources, and expertise. Consequently, any advancements in missile technology have the potential to inform and advance rocket technology. In conclusion, as Ollie, a rocket scientist, works on testing missiles, the improvements that arise in missile technologies will likely contribute to better rocket capabilities. Advancements in propulsion systems, guidance systems, reliability, materials, and technology, as well as knowledge sharing between the missile and rocket sectors, collectively highlight the potential for better missiles to result in better rockets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the call and response track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, a funky drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by surf music and grunge. J.R. Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that \\"Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies.

In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad \\"Off You\\" as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Media's Will Bryant was struck by the song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall.

If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues.

Article: Forks trace their origins back to the ancient Greeks. Forks at that time were fairly large with two tines   that aided in the cutting of meat in the kitchen. The tines prevented meat from twisting or moving during cutting and allowed food to slide off more easily than it would with a knife.  By the 7th century A.D., royal courts of the Middle East began to use forks at the table for dining. From the 10th through the 13th centuries, forks were fairly common among the wealthy in Byzantium. In the 11th century, a Byzantine wife brought forks to Italy; however, they were not widely adopted there until the 16th century. Then in 1533, forks were brought from Italy to France. The French were also slow to accept forks, for using them was thought to be awkward.  In 1608, forks were brought to England by Thomas Coryate, who saw them during his travels in Italy. The English first ridiculed   forks as being unnecessary. \\"Why should a person need a fork when God had given him hands?\\" they asked. Slowly, however, forks came to be adopted by the wealthy as a symbol of their social status. They were prized possessions made of expensive materials intended to impress guests. By the mid 1600s, eating with forks was considered fashionable among the wealthy British.  Early table forks were modeled after kitchen forks, but small pieces of food often fell through the two tines or slipped off easily. In late 17th century France, larger forks with four curved tines were developed. The additional tines made diners less likely to drop food, and the curved tines served as a scoop   so people did not have to constantly switch to a spoon while eating. By the early 19th century, four-tined forks had also been developed in Germany and England and slowly began to spread to America. Question: How did forks become popular in England? Answer: pick from the following. [1]. Wealthy British were impressed by the design of forks.. [2]. Wealthy British thought it awkward to use their hands to eat.. [3]. Wealthy British gave special forks to the nobles as luxurious gifts.. [4]. Wealthy British considered dining with forks a sign of social status..","output":"[4].

Begin by gathering a handful of potato chips, a jar of strawberry jam, a can of aerosol cheese, and a salmon-shaped squeeze toy. 2. Carefully arrange the potato chips in a circle on a serving plate. This will create a base that resembles a potato, but it will not have the same texture or taste as actual pesto potato. 3. Next, take the salmon-shaped squeeze toy and fill it with the aerosol cheese. This will introduce the salmon theme without actually using the fish itself. 4. On the potato chip circle, drizzle the strawberry jam generously. This sweet topping will not taste like pesto, but it will add a unique flavor to the dish. 5. Now, take the salmon-shaped squeeze toy filled with aerosol cheese and place it in the center of the potato chip circle, atop the strawberry jam. Do not cook or heat up the squeeze toy, as this will create a different outcome than the intended salmon and warm pesto potato. 6.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what underneath an object will cause thermal expansion?\\" is \\"gases\\", given that  fire underneath an object will cause thermal expansion? Possible answers: (1). Yes (2). No","output":"(2). No The right answer to the question \\"what underneath an object will cause thermal expansion?\\" is not limited to just \\"gases\\". Thermal expansion occurs when an object heats up and increases in volume due to the increase in its temperature. The heat source that causes thermal expansion can be various forms of energy transfer, such as conduction, convection, or radiation. In the case of fire, it is primarily transferring heat through radiation and convection, which raises the temperature of nearby materials. Fire can heat solids, liquids, and gases, causing them to expand. Thermal expansion can be caused by various heat sources, not just gases: 1. Solids: A hot solid surface, like a heating element or a stove burner, can transfer heat to an object through conduction, causing it to expand. 2. Liquids: When a hot liquid comes into contact with an object, it can transfer heat to the object and cause it to expand. For example, immersing an object in hot water will cause the object to expand due to increased temperature. 3. Gases: A hot gas, like the ones produced by fire, can also transfer heat to the object through convection, leading to thermal expansion. In the case of fire, hot gases and flames transfer heat to the object and cause its temperature to rise and expand. So, while gases are one of the possible sources of heat that can cause thermal expansion, they are not the only one. It is more accurate to say that any form of heat transfer, whether from solids, liquids, or gases, can cause thermal expansion in an object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite Helen's misgivings, the Kents settle in their rooms for the night. Helen is awakened by a noise. Alan goes to investigate. Before he learns anything, he is stabbed by Klove. His body is suspended over Dracula's coffin and his throat slit so that the blood can drip onto Dracula's dust. Immediately, the bloody dust begins to steam and Dracula's body slowly takes shape.

Article:South Bank Square aims to develop land close to the Caw roundabout with frontages to Crescent Link and Clooney Road. If approved, the scheme would take about 10 years to complete. House builders in Northern Ireland are beginning major schemes for the first time since the property crash. Private house building collapsed when a house-price bubble burst in 2007 and 2008. Official figures show just over 4,500 private housing units were completed in Northern Ireland in 2014-2015. That compares to more than 16,500 completions in 2005-2006. South Bank Square is controlled by Maghera businessman Seamus Gillan. His main firm, BSG Civil Engineering, mainly carries out engineering work for public sector clients like Northern Ireland Water. Mr Gillan said the proposed development had got \\"extremely constructive and positive feedback in consultation with local residents\\". He said he knows the importance of addressing traffic issues at the Caw roundabout and the planning application \\"responds to these issues\\". Brian Kelly, the director of Turley and the lead planner for South Bank Square, said recent statistics suggest that housing completions in the Derry City and Strabane Council area have been slower than elsewhere in Northern Ireland. He added that the scheme would represent 18% of the housing needed to accommodate the projected growth of the city's population over the next 20 years.

This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

He says none of the nine have held, or even run for, elective office. O'Neill: All but one attended Harvard or Yale Law School. He says court would perform better if its membership had broader backgrounds. Article:","output":"Title: The Need for Broader Backgrounds in the Supreme Court In recent times, the Supreme Court has increasingly become a battleground for ideological and partisan interpretations of the law. This has highlighted the pressing need for more diversity in the backgrounds of the justices who sit on the nation's highest court. One prominent legal scholar, Timothy P. O'Neill, has pointed out just how limited the spectrum of experience among the current nine justices is. In order for the Supreme Court to function effectively and consistently maintain the trust of the public, the lifelong appointees need to possess a wide array of experiences and backgrounds. O'Neill, an esteemed professor of law, has observed that no current justice on the Supreme Court has a background in politics or legislation, a concerning revelation. The complete absence of elective office-holders among the nation's highest legal authority raises serious questions about the court's understanding of the political realities in which laws and their enforcement operate. Furthermore, such a glaring omission of political experience has the potential to jeopardize the legitimacy and practicality of the court's decisions and undermine public trust in the institution. Given that judicial decisions directly affect the lives of citizens, ensuring that those making such decisions appreciate the nuance of policy-making is of the utmost importance.  Additionally, the fact that all the current justices, except for one, hold law degrees from either Harvard or Yale Law School is another indication of the court's lack of diversity. This stark homogeneity of elite educational background can lead to a narrower understanding of the law, with justices potentially more likely to adhere to the legal interpretations and styles of reasoning taught at these specific institutions. Consequently, the court's ability to provide an impartial and just evaluation of cases could suffer due to this absence of varied outlooks. By incorporating justices who have graduated from a wider range of law schools, the court would be better able to foster a rich and comprehensive discourse that strengthens its decision-making process. Moreover, a Supreme Court that comprises individuals from diverse personal and professional backgrounds would be better equipped to address legal challenges facing an increasingly complex and multifaceted society. For instance, justices with experience in fields such as civil rights or environmental law would bring unique perspectives and expertise that could prove invaluable in evaluating and deciding relevant cases. Similarly, incorporating those from various cultural backgrounds or life experiences would contribute to a better sensitivity and understanding of the issues affecting different segments of the population. Timothy P. O'Neill's cautionary observation about the current state of the Supreme Court should be a wakeup call for those responsible for the nomination and confirmation of future justices. The need for a more heterogeneous makeup of the court must be recognized and addressed, as the stakes are simply too high for the status quo to continue unchallenged. Only by prioritizing broader backgrounds, embracing diversity, and ensuring the court's membership is representative of the complex and varied situations that it must adjudicate, can the American public truly maintain its faith in the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guardian of justice and equity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It can be the means for each child to find their light. A few years ago, I was blessed with the opportunity to teach pre-school students one afternoon a week. One of my most memorable students was Vanessa. She was five years old, had difficulty walking, and could not speak. We mostly sat on the floor for our music lessons and Vanessa liked to sit on my lap. One of her favorite songs was John the Rabbit. It was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students clapped two times while singing the repeating phrase, \\"Oh, yes!\\" Vanessa liked to put her hands together with mine and clap with me. We performed that song during every class, Vanessa and I clapping together. She never said or sang a word. One day late in the school year, when the song was finished, Vanessa turned around, looked me in the eye, clapped her tiny hands two times and said the words \\"Oh, yes!\\" I opened my mouth and could not speak. Through music, we had made a connection. Several years later, I came across Vanessa on the street in town. I stopped my car and waved to say hello. She waved back with a big smile on her face and then clapped her hands two times, mimicking  the song we had performed in our music class.

After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the  Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

Summarize this article: SOCHI, Russia — I ran to the first skating insider I could find: Kurt Browning, a four-time world champion who had been commentating for Canadian television. Could he explain what just happened?      “I don’t know, guys,” Browning said, just a few minutes after being oh-so-sure that Kim Yu-na was the winner of the women’s figure skating competition at the Sochi Olympics, and that she easily had beaten Russia’s Adelina Sotnikova.      “I just couldn’t see how Yu-na and Sotnikova were so close in the components,” he said. “I was shocked. What, suddenly, she just became a better skater overnight? I don’t know what happened. I’m still trying to figure it out.”      Browning and two of his colleagues continued to pore over the judging details, looking at sheets of dozens of numbers representing things like base values and GOEs (that would be grades of execution, of course) and each anonymous judge’s scores.      I stepped back for a moment and realized that the whole situation could not be more ridiculous.      Photo      If Browning, a former Olympic figure skater who remains involved with the sport, couldn’t pinpoint why Sotnikova had just pulled off a major upset of the 2010 Olympic champion, how could fans and television viewers be expected to understand what happened?      And that is the enduring problem with figure skating. It’s why the sport has dropped in participation and why it’s popular among mainstream fans only every four years. Its scoring system is too convoluted and opaque. Its history, which includes the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics judging scandal, shows that it can be corrupted.      One of the judges for Thursday’s women’s competition is married to the general director of the Russian figure skating federation. Another, from Ukraine, was at the center of a voting scandal in ice dancing at the 1998 Nagano Olympics.      The skaters, their coaches and the public are not allowed to know how these or any of the other seven judges voted. The sport’s international governing body chooses to keep the individual votes a secret.      So the conspiracy theories were immediate and fierce.      Sotnikova’s performance was excellent and electric, but many observers seemed to think Kim deserved another gold medal. Some people were just plain confused, and they can’t be blamed.      “Yu-na Kim outskated her, but it’s not just a skating competition anymore — it’s math,” Browning said, explaining that Sotnikova racked up little points here and there to move ahead of Kim.      The governing body, with its judging ranks tarnished by questionable officials and its scoring system favoring math whizzes over artists, is killing its own sport. But the athletes suffer the most.      Ashley Wagner of the United States finished seventh. She said she believed the poor judging tainted the final outcome. In the long program Thursday, she was ranked behind fifth-place Yulia Lipnitskaya, the 15-year-old Russian who was a favorite to win the gold until she stumbled in her short program.      In her long program, Lipnitskaya fell on one of her triple jumps. Wagner stayed on her feet, and later blamed the judges for their irregular, inexplicable scoring.      “It’s confusing and we need to make it clear for people,” Wagner said of the judging system, which has been in place for about a decade. “I’m speechless. This sport needs to be held accountable if it wants more people to believe in it.”      It’s easy to feel sorry for both Kim and Sotnikova. Kim is one of the best skaters in history — appearing graceful and effortless on the ice — and has said this would be the last competition of her skating career. Sotnikova skated with a flair and charisma that rallied the raucous Russian crowd around her. At one point, as she glided across the rink, she raised her hands to egg on the fans, who responded with a roar.      Continue reading the main story Slide Show      Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist, said it was a brilliant move for her to realize how crucial it was to win over the crowd. The whole arena heard the cheers and felt the stands shaking as the spectators stamped their feet for her. Surely the judges heard it and felt it, too.      “You have human beings pushing the buttons,” Wylie said of the judges, noting that human beings can’t help but be swayed — whether consciously or unconsciously — by a biased audience.      He said that figure skaters “learn to live with” that bias, and that they know they might win some but also might lose some.      Will spectators live with it, or will they stop watching?      Sotnikova scored 149.95 points in the free skate. It was a massive leap from her previous best, recorded last month, of 131.63. I asked Wylie how he would explain Sotnikova’s sudden improvement to the casual fan. He paused, and couldn’t come up with an answer.      “It’s figure skating at its finest, right?” he said.      Everyone around him laughed. ||||| IOC: There's no figure skating judging controversy      Dan Wolken | USA TODAY Sports      IOC spokesman%3A IOC has a pretty sophisticated judging system with safeguards in place      No official complaint has been filed by South Korea      The IOC was quick Friday morning to play down any hint of a figure skating judging scandal after Adelina Sotnikova of Russia was the surprising winner of the gold medal, upsetting reigning Olympic gold medalist Yuna Kim of South Korea and Italy's Carolina Kostner.      \\"I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself,\\" said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. \\"I think first off we have to see if there's an official complaint, because the people concerned I'd assume would make a complaint and it would go to the federation. I'm not aware there's been such a complaint and if there was they'd got through the federation. I don't think it's even happened yet. If it does that will be the first step to go through if there isn't a credible complaint we wouldn't take it any further.\\"      After Thursday night's event, some skating insiders questioned Sotnikova's marks and the makeup of the judging panel.      BRENNAN: Suspicions raised in competition      FTW: Gold was surprising, but not shady      The nine judges for the short and long programs are chosen by draw from a pool of 13, with eight of the judges only working one event or the other. Judges from the United States, South Korea, Great Britain and Sweden were not chosen to work the women's long program after being on the women's short program panel the night before.      Two of their replacements were Ukrainian Yuri Balkov, who was kicked out of judging for a year after being tape-recorded by a Canadian judge trying to fix the Nagano ice dancing competition, and Alla Shekhovtseva, a Russian judge who is married to Russian federation general director Valentin Pissev. The two other new long program judges were from Estonia and France, which was the country that conspired with Russia to try to fix the pairs and ice dancing competition at the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.      But Adams was having none of that.      \\"I think we need a little of a reality check here,\\" he said. \\"I don't know much about skating I saw some of it last night and her performance was agreed by many to be absolutely fantastic. I'm not an expert. The IOC has a pretty sophisticated judging system with safeguards in place and each of the judges has a video review where they can review each of the jumps so there's a number of things in place. At this stage, I think we're discussing purely hypothetical things and my personal point of view would be to congratulate a fantastic performance.      \\"I think it's the federation which chooses the makeup of the panel and it's clear there's no hiding who's on the panel.

Adelina Sotnikova of Russia celebrates her gold medal in the ladies free skate program during the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games at Iceberg Skating Palace. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)      SOCHI, Russia — One of the nine judges who picked a young Russian skater over two more refined competitors for the Olympic gold medal Thursday night was suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.      And another is the wife of the former president and current general director of the Russian figure skating federation. Another Olympics, another huge skating controversy involving the countries of the former Soviet Union.      The issue of inflated scores for the Russians has been a hot topic of conversation at these Olympic Games, and the women's figure skating long program Thursday night renewed the debate. Adelina Sotnikova of Russia was the surprising winner of the gold medal, upsetting reigning Olympic gold medalist Yuna Kim of South Korea and Italy's Carolina Kostner.      STUNNER: Sotnikova beats Kim for gold medal      \\"It's sad that I just presumed Sotnikova was going to get a boost (in points) because this was in Russia,\\" former U.S. Olympic figure skating coach Audrey Weisiger said in a phone interview. \\"Isn't it sad that I automatically thought that? Not one person in skating I've talked to said that's the way it should have gone.\\"      \\"I was surprised with the result,\\" Joseph Inman, a top U.S. international judge who was on the women's panel at the 2002 Olympics, said in a telephone interview.      REACTION: Did judges make the right call?      \\"That's not fair to see Carolina and Yuna, who have great skating skills and had great skating tonight -- good jumps, nice presence on the ice, maturity, expression -- could be six points behind somebody who has tremendous skill but is just coming out of juniors,\\" said Gwendal Peizerat, the 2002 ice dancing gold medalist from France, who is a television commentator here.      \\"Compared to Carolina, compared to Yuna, something has happened.\\"      The nine judges for the short and long programs are chosen by draw from a pool of 13, with eight of the judges only working one event or the other. Judges from the United States, South Korea, Great Britain and Sweden were not chosen to work the women's long program after being on the women's short program panel the night before.      AMERICANS: Gold takes fourth, Wagner stays strong      Two of their replacements were Ukrainian Yuri Balkov, who was kicked out of judging for a year after being tape-recorded by a Canadian judge trying to fix the Nagano ice dancing competition, and Alla Shekhovtseva, a Russian judge who is married to Russian federation general director Valentin Pissev. The two other new long program judges were from Estonia and France, which was the country that conspired with Russia to try to fix the pairs and ice dancing competition at the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.      \\"The (judging) panel made me wish that the United States and Canada had split up into many different countries,\\" said choreographer Lori Nichol, who works with Kostner and fourth-place finisher Gracie Gold of the United States, among others. \\"It certainly was a different panel tonight.\\"      She was referring to the fact that in the days of the Soviet Union, only one judge represented the entire country, all its republics. Now, judges from several former Soviet republics can be on one panel, as was the case Thursday night.      In other words, the Cold War is alive and well in the Olympic figure skating venue.      VIDEO: Daily Olympics wrap-up      CLOSE Matt Pearl of 11Alive catches you up on everything from Sochi for Feb. 20, 2014.      What happened tonight in the women's figure skating competition was worse than the 2002 Salt Lake City pairs judging scandal because, this time, we'll never find out who might have done what because all the judges' scores are now anonymous. In 2002, French judge Marie-Reine LeGougne's scores were easily identifiable. But in 2004, the International Skating Union adopted a new judging system in which all judges scores are now totaled into two numbers: a total element score and a total program component score.      The idea was to help eliminate bloc judging and cheating, but the result is that the system now hides, and even can protect, those who are not playing by the rules.      U.S. Olympic team bronze medalist Ashley Wagner said she was not able to watch much if any of the medalists' performances because she was competing in the final group of skaters. But she herself was the recipient of some questionable judging, finishing seventh, two places below Russian Julia Lipnitskaia, even though Wagner never fell and Lipnitskaia fell in both her short and long programs.      \\"People need to be held accountable,\\" Wagner said after the competition, \\"they need to get rid of the anonymous judging. There are many changes that need to come to this sport if we want a fan base because you can't depend on this sport to always be there when you need it. ... This sport needs to be held more accountable with its system if they want people to believe in it.\\"      Follow columnist Christine Brennan on Twitter @cbrennansports.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: The Lenape (English:  or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. Context: New Amsterdam was founded in 1624 by the Dutch in what would later become New York City. Dutch settlers also founded a colony at present-day Lewes, Delaware on June 3, 1631 and named it Zwaanendael (Swan Valley). The colony had a short life, as in 1632 a local band of Lenape killed the 32 Dutch settlers after a misunderstanding escalated over Lenape defacement of the insignia of the Dutch West India Company. In 1634, the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock went to war with the Lenape over access to trade with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. They defeated the Lenape, and some scholars believe that the Lenape may have become tributaries to the Susquehannock. After the warfare, the Lenape referred to the Susquehannock as \\"uncles.\\" The Iroquois added the Lenape to the Covenant Chain in 1676; the Lenape were tributary to the Five Nations (later Six) until 1753, shortly before the outbreak of the French and Indian War (a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe).  The Lenape's quick adoption of trade goods, and their need to trap furs to meet high European demand, resulted in their disastrous over-harvesting of the beaver population in the lower Hudson Valley. With the fur sources exhausted, the Dutch shifted their operations to present-day upstate New York. The Lenape who produced wampum in the vicinity of Manhattan Island temporarily forestalled the negative effects of the decline in trade. Lenape population fell sharply during this period, due to high fatalities from epidemics of infectious diseases carried by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity, as the diseases had arisen on the Asian continent and moved west into Europe, where they had become endemic in the cities.  The Lenape had a culture in which the clan and family controlled property. Europeans often tried to contract for land with the tribal chiefs, confusing their culture with that of neighboring tribes such as the Iroquois. The Lenape would petition for grievances on the basis that not all their families had been recognized in the transaction (not that they wanted to \\"share\\" the land). After the Dutch arrival in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement until the 1660s to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson. The Dutch finally established a garrison at Bergen, which allowed settlement west of the Hudson within the province of New Netherland. This land was purchased from the Lenape after the fact.  In 1682, William Penn and Quaker colonists created the English colony of Pennsylvania beginning at the lower Delaware River. A peace treaty was negotiated between the newly arriving English and Lenape at what is now known as Penn Treaty Park. In the decades immediately following, some 20,000 new colonists arrived in the region, putting pressure on Lenape settlements and hunting grounds. Although Penn endeavored to live peaceably with the Lenape and to create a colony that would do the same, he also expected his authority and that of the colonial government to take precedence. His new colony effectively displaced many Lenape and forced others to adapt to new cultural demands. Penn gained a reputation for benevolence and tolerance, but his efforts resulted in more effective colonization of the ancestral Lenape homeland than previous ones. Question: How were the Lenape affected by disease?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Lenape people were badly affected by diseases brought by the Europeans, such as measles and smallpox. They didn't have natural immunity to these diseases because these illnesses came from Asia and Europe. When the Europeans arrived and interacted with the Lenape, many Lenape people got sick from these diseases, and many of them died, causing their population to fall sharply."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The Linguistic Habits of a New Generation        In the year of 1914 a young girl named Monica Baldwin entered a convent ,remaining there until 1941 when she returned to the outer world. During these twenty-eight years wars and revolutions had come and gone in Europe. Her uncle, Stanley Baldwin, had led his country for some time. Technical developments had changed the conditions of everyday life almost beyond recognitions, but all these events had left as a matter of fact untouched the small religious community to which she had belonged. In 1949 Miss Baldwin published her impressions of those bewildering years of her return to a world in which the motorcar had replaced the horse and carriage and where respectable women showed their legs and painted their faces.        Yet it was not only these odd sights that surprised her, for she was more puzzled by what she heard. During a railway journey the term \\"luggage in advance\\" meant nothing to her, so in desperation she asked the porter to do as he thought best. Reading the newspapers made her feel very stupid, because the writers of reviews and leading articles used words and phrases such as Jazz,prefix = st1 /Hollywood, Cocktail and Isolationism. These and many others were quite incomprehensible to Miss Baldwin, who was really bewildered when friends said: \\"It's your funeral or Believe it or not.\\" This is a rare and valuable reminder to the rest of us that the English language does not stand still.

They have subtle differences in the focus and objective of the information being sought. Let's analyze them separately to better understand their distinctions. 1. Does any university in Canada have rolling admission? This question seeks to find out if there exists at least one university in Canada that practices rolling admission. In other words, the asker merely wants to know whether such a university exists within Canada or not. The answer provided would generally be a simple yes or no (though extra context may be provided), without requiring an exhaustive list of any specific institutions. 2. What are the different universities in Canada which offer rolling admissions? In contrast, this second question assumes that there are, indeed, universities in Canada that follow a rolling admission process. The asker is interested in obtaining a more comprehensive list of these specific universities, rather than merely finding out if such institutions exist. An answer to this question would typically list multiple universities along with any additional relevant information about their particular rolling admission process. To summarize, the first question focuses on verifying the existence of any Canadian university with a rolling admission system, while the second question is more concerned with providing a detailed list of these institutions. The difference lies in the depth and detail of information requested, with the latter question seeking more granular data related to this specific aspect of Canadian higher education."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was a gamble  but polling suggested it might be working. His opponent  Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam  saw his lead over Gillespie erode over the past few weeks.  Trump  weighed in for Gillespie in a series of tweets and with automated Election Day phone calls encouraging turnout. .@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA. MS-13 and crime will be gone. Vote today  ASAP! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7  2017  Trump  wasted no time in distancing  himself  from Gillespie  enjoying the spaciousness of  his  now-280-character tweets. Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don’t forget  Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before! —  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8   2017 We’ve noted before that  Trump  has an insurance premium against any calls for  his  impeachment.  His  popularity with Republicans has slipped since the beginning of  his  presidency  but  he ’s still very popular with them  particularly more conservative members of  his  party. (Per Gallup  more than 9 in 10 conservative Republicans approve of  Trump .) Because Republican Party primaries see an overrepresentation of conservatives  that meant that Republicans eager to win reelection to Congress were less likely to turn on the president.  Trump’s  tweet distancing  himself  from Gillespie sugarcoats the election in a way that may make  Trump  feel better but probably isn’t fooling anyone on Capitol Hill.  His  claim that the GOP won four of four federal races misses a few important points. The first is that those races were in Republican-held districts. The second is that the Democrats saw big gains in most of those races relative to past elections. The third is that the figure is actually four of five;  Trump  likes to ignore a race in California won by the Democrats. But it also does something very dangerous for  Trump  right now. It shows  yet again  that  he  isn’t loyal to  his  political partners. We’ve seen this before. When  Trump  backed the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare (having no plan of  his  own)   he  responded to  its  passage by declaring the bill to be “mean” — as though  he  hadn’t previously claimed it was nearly without flaws. (It was health care  not immigration  that was the big issue in Virginia  according to exit polls. Northam won among voters concerned about health care by a more than 3-to-1 margin.) Even before Election Day in Alabama earlier this year   Trump  began to distance  himself  from  his  preferred candidate Republican Senate primary  Luther Strange  hinting that  he  had perhaps made a mistake — a shift that was certainly informed by polls showing a likely Strange loss. When that happened   Trump  deleted some of  his  tweets of endorsement. Strange’s campaign  unlike Gillespie’s  didn’t embrace Trumpist politics such as the threat of the gang MS-13.  He  tried to win as a more typical establishment conservative  to no avail. Gillespie tried to more directly embrace  Trump  politics — and lost badly. And then saw  Trump  turn on him. Think of the message that  Trump  has sent to Republicans. Stand with him on policy and have him bad-mouth what you passed. Embrace his endorsement and see a loss followed by  Trump  playing down his support. Embrace his endorsement and his politics  and see a loss followed by actual criticism. These are all one-offs — but politics generally suffers from a small sample size from which to draw conclusions  and no one spends more time trying to draw conclusions than politicians. Bannon’s track record in electoral politics? He helped  Trump  lose the popular vote and win the electoral college in 2016. He embraced Luther Strange’s opponent after Strange was trailing. And now he watched the “Trump-Stewart talking points” lead nowhere. On its home page  Breitbart also championed  Trump ’s argument that Gillespie should have embraced him more robustly. That’s a flawed theory.  Trump  is very unpopular in Virginia  and Northam won among those who disapprove of  Trump  by a 7-to-1 margin  according to preliminary exit polls. A third of voters said their vote in the race was meant to send a message of opposition to  Trump  — twice as many as said it was a message of support. What’s more   Trump  made  his  feelings clear. Those who wanted to vote for  Trump’s  candidate knew who that candidate was. As in Alabama  voters went in another direction. It’s critical to remember that Democrats were supposed to win this race  albeit not necessarily by as wide a margin as they did. Democrats hold the governor’s mansion and Hillary Clinton won by five points last year.  Trump  could have congratulated Gillespie on a hard-fought race and noted the uphill battle. Instead   he  decided to try to spin the loss to  his  advantage. It’s unlikely that many Republicans worried about next November will be convinced by  Trump ’s argument. Instead  they’re likely to take another lesson:  Trump  can’t deliver a victory for you when you’re trailing  and neither can Trumpism. (In fact  there’s every reason to think that  Trump  was the liability that  his  poll numbers would suggest  with Gillespie doing fine in western Virginia but getting beaten badly in more-Democratic Northern Virginia.) Nor will  Trump  stand with you should things go south. If  next summer  the question of  Trump ’s fate as president is raised  how might Republicans in center-right districts be expected to evaluate that decision?

The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service.

It now appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"China's COMPASS system is likely to get priority for the E2 band. This is because, based on International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency. In this case, it appears that Chinese COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites. As a result, China's COMPASS system will have primary rights to these frequency ranges, including the E2 band. However, it's essential to note that subsequent users, like Europe's Galileo system, are required to obtain permission before using the frequency and ensuring that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original broadcasts of the Chinese COMPASS system. This is to avoid inter-system interference, particularly within the E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service.

CHAPTER X  For three weeks after his meeting with Bertrade de Montfort and his sojourn at the castle of John de Stutevill, Norman of Torn was busy with his wild horde in reducing and sacking the castle of John de Grey, a royalist baron who had captured and hanged two of the outlaw's fighting men; and never again after his meeting with the daughter of the chief of the barons did Norman of Torn raise a hand against the rebels or their friends.  Shortly after his return to Torn, following the successful outcome of his expedition, the watch upon the tower reported the approach of a dozen armed knights. Norman sent Red Shandy to the outer walls to learn the mission of the party, for visitors seldom came to this inaccessible and unhospitable fortress; and he well knew that no party of a dozen knights would venture with hostile intent within the clutches of his great band of villains.  The great red giant soon returned to say that it was Henry de Montfort, oldest son of the Earl of Leicester, who had come under a flag of truce and would have speech with the master of Torn.  \\"Admit them, Shandy,\\" commanded Norman of Torn, \\"I will speak with them here.\\"  When the party, a few moments later, was ushered into his presence it found itself facing a mailed knight with drawn visor.

Here is a question about this article: Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \\"architecture parlante\\". What is the answer to this question: What Edmund Burke concept is linked to Boullee's ideas?","output":"The answer to the question regarding the Edmund Burke concept that is linked to Étienne-Louis Boullée's ideas is the concept of the \\"sublime.\\" Edmund Burke, an 18th-century philosopher, developed the aesthetic theory of the sublime in his influential work, \\"A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful.\\"  The concept of the sublime refers to an overwhelming sense of awe, grandeur, and even fear that one experiences when faced with something vast, powerful, or transcendent. This sense of awe is typically triggered by monumental landscapes or natural phenomena, such as vast mountains, severe storms, or imposing universal structures, that surpass ordinary human experience and understanding. In architecture, the sublime can be evoked through the use of large-scale and austere geometrical forms, imposing proportions, and the suggestion of eternal or infinite space.  Étienne-Louis Boullée, a neoclassical architect of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, sought to embody the concept of the sublime within his architectural designs. His many graphite drawings and projects reflect an emphasis on spare geometrical architecture, often incorporating large-scale and imposing forms that suggest the eternal nature of the universe. Boullée aimed to create environments that would evoke a sense of awe and wonder in the viewer, inspired by the vastness and power of the cosmos. In this way, Boullée's ideas connect closely with Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime.  This association between Boullée's architectural ideals and Burke's concept of the sublime reveals an important and lasting influence that the theory of the sublime had on the development of neoclassical architecture, and particularly on the works of architects such as Boullée and his contemporaries, including Claude Nicolas Ledoux."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times.

Before dying, Charles takes cover inside a toy store, finding boxes of talking \\"Good Guy\\" dolls and then uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning and it burns to the ground.Later that morning, 6-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) tells his widowed mother Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) that he wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unable to afford the full price, Karen buys a stolen doll from a street peddler, which is the same doll into which Charles Lee Ray had earlier transferred his soul.That night, as Andy is playing with the doll who has introduced himself as \\"Chucky\\" Karen's friend, Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff), who is babysitting Andy, scolds him for turning on the evening news and placing Chucky in front of the TV. When Andy tries to deny the accusation, she doesn't believe him and sends him to bed. Maggie is later violently struck with a hammer by an unseen figure and falls out of the apartment kitchen window to her death.

It weighs more than 1,000 kilos and is at least ten meters long. Some people say it has a head like a horse. Others say it looks like a snake. Many people travel to Loch Ness to look for this strange monster, but only a few people have seen it. At least, they say they have seen it. The Loch Ness Monster is a famous legend . The first story about a monster in Loch Ness was told over 500 years ago, but the legend of the monster spread widely only in the twenties century. In 1933, a husband and wife reported that they saw a big monster in Loch Ness. Several people have taken photos, but at least one of them was a hoax . During the 1960s, a team was formed to look for the monster. They took many photos and made movies, but they were never able to find a monster. There is no real fact that a monster lives in Loch Ness, but there is also no fact that one doesn't live. One thing is true about Loch Ness: there are a lot of tourists there.

Solve -2614*r = -2604*r - 70 for r. Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the problem -2614*r = -2604*r - 70 for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate r First, we want to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to eliminate one of the r terms.  Since -2604*r is the lesser term, we will add 2604*r to both sides of the equation to cancel it out. This will leave only one r term on the other side of the equation. -2614*r + 2604*r = -2604*r + 2604*r - 70 Step 2: Simplify Now simplify the left side of the equation: (-2614 + 2604) * r = -10 * r And since the -2604*r terms cancel out on the right side of the equation, we're left with: -10*r = -70 Step 3: Solve for r Now, we just need to isolate r by dividing both sides of the equation by -10: -10*r / -10 = -70 / -10 This simplifies to: r = 7 So the solution to the equation -2614*r = -2604*r - 70 is r = 7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Using collagen powder is an easy way to add this vital nutrient to your daily meals. This is a great idea if you work out or play sports, as the protein in collagen helps build and restore muscles. Collagen powder is said to reduce cravings, especially for sweet foods. Protein helps regulate blood sugar level, and sugar cravings are often caused from blood sugar fluctuations. By using collagen powder, you may be able to balance your cravings and kick them to the curb. This over time can help you lose weight, if paired with healthy eating and regular exercise. In general, collagen powder may help reduce inflammation in joints across the body. The added nutrients help promote bone health. Consider using collagen powder if you suffer from widespread joint pain or osteoarthritis. For instance, this can help athletes with sore, achy bones. While using skincare products with collagen helps target particular areas, adding collagen powder to your diet can help hydrate the skin overall. Using collagen powder can also help your skin produce collagen naturally, which decreases wrinkles. Results may take up to 8 weeks. There are 2 different types of collagen powder, though both are very rewarding. Collagen peptides work great for skin, bone, and digestive health. Collagen powder is most effective for gut health and improving sleep quality. As a whole, collagen peptides is easiest to digest and retain the nutrients.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Joel Morales, 12, committed suicide after a two-year barrage of bullying because of his small stature, according to his family.      Now the boy’s family from East Harlem, New York have filed a law suit against the city, the Board of Education and four youths.      His mother, Lisbeth Babilonia, said the bullies hassled Joel every day, throwing pencils and taunting him.      In the suit, Joel was described as ‘a small-framed, fragile boy who sometimes stuttered and had problems with fine motor skills. He was extremely short and underweight for his age’.            He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News .      The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants.      The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit.      Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents.            After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him.      Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’      Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school.      The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year.      Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give me a hug and a kiss.”’      At the time of Joel’s death, it was revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough.      A 'beautiful boy': Joel suffered physical and emotional abuse, and while his mother complained to the Board of Education it did little to alleviate the situation      Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself.      Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR.            Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died.            Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.'      The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.'

A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire.

I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  Which country caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean?","output":"To determine which country caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean, we need to compare the environmental practices and policies of Finland and Russia. We will consider the main factors contributing to marine pollution mentioned in the prompt: agricultural chemicals, livestock and human waste, and marine debris. Step 1: Compare agricultural practices Finland is very aware of environmental pollution and has stringent regulations in place to minimize the use of harmful chemicals in agriculture. They employ sustainable farming techniques and prioritize preserving the quality of water bodies. Russia, on the other hand, practices conventional agriculture and uses fertilizers, which may result in harmful chemicals and nutrients entering rivers and eventually, the ocean. Step 2: Compare livestock and human waste management Finland, being conscious of environmental pollution, is more likely to have better waste management systems for both livestock and human waste. This means that Finland's waste disposal practices would have a lower impact on marine pollution. In Russia, where awareness of environmental pollution might be lower, it's possible that waste management practices are not as efficient, potentially leading to a higher impact on marine pollution. Step 3: Compare marine debris management Marine debris, or litter, is a consequence of human activity. While the prompt does not provide specific information about Finland's and Russia's marine debris management practices, we can reasonably assume that Finland's strong environmental awareness would result in better waste disposal practices and reduced marine debris. Russia's environmental practices, on the other hand, might not be as stringent. Conclusion: Based on the comparison of agricultural practices, livestock and human waste management, and marine debris management, it is reasonable to conclude that Finland would cause fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean compared to Russia.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire... Answer:","output":"The population of Stretford had increased by 40% in 1901, rising from 21,751 in 1891 to 30,436. This increase was primarily due to the arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate, which attracted people to the town for work opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Today, we're going to tell you a story about a football player named Gostkowski and how many touchdowns he caught one special day. Do you know what a touchdown is? It is when a team in the sport of football scores points by carrying the ball across the other team's goal line or catching a pass thrown across the goal line. It's a very exciting moment in the game! Now, let's talk about Gostkowski. His full name is Stephen Gostkowski, and he is a famous football player. But guess what? He is actually not known for catching touchdowns. That's because he has been a kicker in the National Football League (NFL) for many years, and he mainly plays for the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans. A kicker's job is to kick the ball to the other team or try to score points by kicking it through the goal posts. So, Gostkowski is really, really good at kicking the ball! Back to our story about how many touchdowns Gostkowski caught on that special day. Since Gostkowski is a kicker and not a player who catches the ball, we can say that he didn't catch any touchdowns that day. Instead, he was busy doing what he does best – kicking the ball! So, remember, friends, Gostkowski is a super talented kicker who doesn't catch touchdowns, but he sure knows how to help his team score points in other ways! I hope you enjoyed our little adventure with Gostkowski and his journey in the world of football.

Peale was born in 1741 in Chester, Queen Anne's County, Maryland, the son of Charles Peale and his wife Margaret. He had a younger brother, James Peale (1749-1831). Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. Peale's enthusiasm for the nascent national government brought him to the capital, Philadelphia, in 1776, where he painted portraits of American notables and visitors from overseas. His estate, which is on the campus of La Salle University in Philadelphia, can still be visited. He also raised troops for the War of Independence and eventually gained the rank of captain in the Pennsylvania militia by 1776, having participated in several battles. While in the field, he continued to paint, doing miniature portraits of various officers in the Continental Army. He produced enlarged versions of these in later years. He served in the Pennsylvania state assembly in 1779-1780, after which he returned to painting full-time.  Peale was quite prolific as an artist. While he did portraits of scores of historic figures (such as James Varnum, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton), he is probably best known for his portraits of George Washington. The first time Washington sat for a portrait was with Peale in 1772, and they had six other sittings; using these seven as models, Peale produced altogether close to 60 portraits of Washington. In January 2005, a full-length portrait of Washington at Princeton from 1779 sold for 21.3 million, setting a record for the highest price paid for an American portrait.  One of his most celebrated paintings is The Staircase Group (1795), a double portrait of his sons Raphaelle and Titian, painted in the trompe l'oeil style.

Amanda Knox has clarified statements she made to an Italian newspaper yesterday when she said that if she is re-convicted for the murder of her former roommate in an ongoing retrial then she will go on the lam. Today she put out a statement through her lawyers saying that if she is found guilty, 'legally I'll be defined as a \\"fugitive,\\" but I will continue to fight for my innocence.' 'I will not willingly submit myself to injustice.' This comes after she told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'If I am convicted then I will be, as they say, on the run.’ Rewording her thoughts: Amanda Knox has clarified an earlier statement where she said she would go on the run if she is convicted of her roommate's murder. Knox, 26, has stayed in Seattle while there is an Italian retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Her ex boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has been present for the trial and while they have not seen each other since they were released from prison, they have been in touch. ’I have spoken to Raffaele... he is more optimistic than me,' she told La Repubblica. Knox and Sollecito are accused of stabbing Ms Kercher to death and sexually assaulting her while the young women were studying abroad in Perugia in 2007. Knox has not appeared and explained. herself saying: ’It was a really painful decision not to attend the. retrial. I wanted to come. I wanted to be present in court. ‘I was put in jail for four years with no proof, but on suppositions.’ This latest interview is not the first time that Knox made it clear that she has no intentions of returning to prison for the murder. First time around: Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were the immediate suspects in Meredith Kercher's murder and their behavior in the days following the discovery of her dead body surprised many. Raffaele Sollecito stands in the courtroom ahead of the hearing in the retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher, in Florence, Italy. 'I was already imprisoned as an innocent person in Italy and I can't reconcile the choice to go back with that experience,' she told The Today Show's Matt Lauer during a September 2013 interview following the release of her book. Victim: Knox's roommate during their time abroad, Meredith Kercher, was sexually assaulted and murdered in 2007. One other wish of hers that has not yet come true is the hope that she can meet with Meredith's family so that she could personally tell them she was not involved. 'When I saw (the Kerchers) in court I. wanted to speak with them and I asked my lawyers if I could do that. My. lawyer approached them but their lawyers rejected it.’ ’I want to speak to them. I want to tell them I had nothing to do with Meredith's death, that I liked her and we were friends. When asked about Knox's comments, the. Kercher family's lawyer Francesco Maresca said: ’Amanda is the accused. This is the moment of the accused. She should stop her declarations.’ Sollecito's defense lawyer told the appeals court Thursday that the young lovers were blamed by authorities for the murder to calm fears that a monster was loose in their Italian university town. Defender Giulia Bongiorno said Sollecito and Knox were identified as suspects by police in a 'record' four days after the murder because authorities 'did not want to think that a stranger, a monster, could have entered a house and murdered a student'. Bongiorno said much of the evidence later used to convict the pair in their first trial - including the presumed murder weapon found in Sollecito's kitchen drawer and a clasp that had been ripped from Kercher's bra - had not even been gathered by investigators at that point. Bongiorno, on the last day of closing arguments in the pair's third trial, showed a court slides and videos in a bid to dismantle the prosecution's case. Sollecito sat at her side. If she is convicted prosecutors have. demanded Knox be jailed for 30 years and would seek her extradition from. the United States. Prior to the retrial, Sollecito had been spending a considerable. amount of time in the Dominican Republic, and though he also risks jail, he has. insisted he will remain in Italy for the verdict.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does condensation cause?\\" is \\"emptiness\\", given that  condensation causes rain to form?","output":"No, the term \\"emptiness\\" does not accurately answer the question \\"what does condensation cause?\\" in the context of the water cycle and Meteorology. Condensation is a significant process in the water cycle, and understanding it requires knowledge of its functional role within the ecosystem. Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. It is crucial in the water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds. These clouds may produce precipitation, which is the primary route for water to return to the earth's surface in the water cycle. Thus, condensation leads to the formation of clouds, rain, fog, dew, and other forms of atmospheric moisture. Condensation is the opposite of evaporation. Both of these processes work together to transport water throughout the ecosystem. When it comes to the concept of \\"emptiness,\\" it's worth noting that condensation fills the atmosphere with water droplets, leading to a state of \\"fullness\\" rather than \\"emptiness.\\"  Furthermore, condensation impacts many other areas beyond meteorology: 1. In everyday life: Condensation can occur whenever we see our glasses fog up when we move from a cooler to a warmer environment. It is also the reason why droplets of water form on the outside of a cold beverage. 2. In industry: Various industries and engineering applications, such as in power generation plants, refrigeration units, and distillation processes, use condensation to either remove excess heat or separate mixtures. 3. In biology: Condensation reactions are essential for the formation of many important biological polymers. For example, two amino acids may condense, producing a peptide bond. In summary, condensation causes a lot more than \\"emptiness.\\" It plays a crucial role in the water cycle, forming clouds that can produce precipitation, like rain, and it's applied widely in biological processes and human-made systems like power generation and refrigeration units. The term \\"emptiness\\" seems to inadequately describe these diverse and important processes resultant of condensation."},{"instruction":"Available choices: (I) No. (II) Yes.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"No, these two questions are not the same. The first question relates to dealing with an old, stubborn, and difficult grandfather, while the second question is about facing repeated rejections in a job search and a failing business. I will address each question separately. 1. Dealing with an old, stubborn, and difficult grandfather: Step 1: Try to empathize with your grandfather by understanding his perspective, experiences, and emotions. Recognize that his attitude may be a result of his life experiences, fears, or frustrations. Step 2: Be patient and listen to him. Sometimes, older individuals just want to express themselves and feel heard. Give your grandfather the opportunity to share his thoughts and feelings without judgment or interruption. Step 3: Avoid confrontations and arguments. Rather than fiercely contradicting or challenging his opinions, take a calmer approach by providing constructive solutions and alternatives. Step 4: Establish clear boundaries. Make sure your grandfather knows what behaviors are and are not acceptable, and communicate this in a respectful yet firm manner. Step 5: Encourage your grandfather to engage in activities that he enjoys, or find common interests that can help create a positive bond between you and him. Step 6: Seek professional help if necessary. If your grandfather's behavior becomes unmanageable or affects your mental well-being, consider discussing it with a therapist or support group. 2. Facing repeated rejections in job search and a failing business: Step 1: Analyze the reasons for the rejections. Carefully review the feedback you received from your dream job interviews and identify areas where improvements can be made. Step 2: Identify the shortcomings in your business. Assess your business model, operations, finances, and marketing strategies to pinpoint potential issues or areas for growth. Step 3: Expand your job search. Consider applying to other companies and industries that align with your skills and interests, be open to exploring new opportunities, and network with professionals in your field. Step 4: Enhance your skills and competencies. Participate in workshops, courses, and professional development activities that can help you become a more competitive candidate in the job market. Step 5: Revise your resume and cover letter. Tailor them to each job application, highlighting your most relevant skills, achievements, and experiences. Step 6: Reevaluate your business approach. Explore new strategies or make necessary adjustments to your current business plan in order to stimulate growth and success. Step 7: Maintain a positive attitude. Keep in mind that rejection is part of the job search and entrepreneurial journey. See each setback as a learning opportunity and remain persistent in your efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Smothering your lawn will block light and prevent photosynthesis, killing the grass and weeds. The smothering method is not as dependent upon the weather as solarization or herbicides.  Mow the grass closely. Cover it with layers of cardboard or newspaper (use black ink; colored ink could contain metals). Wet the covering and top it off with grass clippings (4 inches / 10 cm or more), compost, 6-inch (15cm) wood chips, or another organic mulch. Black plastic also works. It will block the sun and prevent photosynthesis. Avoid heavy mulching in shady areas,which prevents the soil from warming up, causing too much moisture in the root zone.  The layers of your old lawn will break down, making compost. The soil is now ready for planting. Solarization uses the sun’s heat to kill the old grass by cooking it.  Weeds, seeds and pathogens are also removed.You’ll need to cover the entire lawn with clear plastic  Keep the lawn covered for about 7 weeks. Cloudy days slow things down. The hottest days with direct sunlight are optimal for solarization. Remove the plastic when the grass has died. The dead grass can also be removed, or you can leave it as compost. Clear plastic is preferable to opaque because more sunlight can get to the grass surface. Thick plastic will last longer because it’s sturdier and resists tears. Herbicides will kill weeds, roots and grass. Read the full label before you begin and be sure to follow all safety instructions, including the use of personal protective gear. Mix the herbicide in accordance with the directions on the product, then apply it over the entire lawn, taking care to avoid nearby garden plants.  Select a herbicide that will degrade quickly.  This will minimize how long it stays in the environment.  Herbicides containing glyphosate are a wise choice. Add just a few drops of dishwashing liquid soap or another surfactant to help the herbicide stick to vegetation. Apply the herbicide on a sunny day (60 degrees or above) so that the herbicide will dry quickly. Choose a day with little to no wind to avoid drifting. Reapply the herbicide if the turf has not completely died.  Wait about four weeks before reapplying. Wait one week after the final application. Till the dead turf into your soil. Sod removal works best for grass that doesn't have long roots. Grasses that are perennial, Bermuda grass and perennial rye, for instance, have roots that go down several feet. It’s hard to get all of it by cutting away the sod. Kill the vegetation using one of the methods above first to make sod removal easier.  Rent a sod cutter if you don’t have one.  They're about 70.00 per day. Alternately, you can use a flat shovel rather than a sod cutter. It’s less expensive, but it’s a lot more labor. Cut the sod into strips. After cutting the sod, roll up the strips and dispose of them. Alternately, you can leave the sod in place by inverting it and using it for compost. Cover the inverted sod in 6 to 10 layers of newspaper. The decomposed sod improves the soil and prevents grass from regrowing. Do not leave the sod in place if it contains undesirable weeds or invasive grasses. You can also use the inverted sod to make high places on your lawn or to fill in low places. Summary:","output":"This article discusses various methods to remove lawn grass and weeds, including smothering with mulch or plastic, solarization with clear plastic, using herbicides with proper precautions, and sod removal with a sod cutter or shovel, to prepare the soil for replanting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

CNNMoney.com Market Report - Apr. 25, 2007 NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The Dow industrials jumped 136 points Wednesday afternoon to close above 13,000 for the first time as investors hailed upbeat earnings from Amazon.com, possible asset sales by Alcoa and a strong reading on the economy. The gain in the Dow Jones industrial average (up 136.44 to 13,090.38, Charts) was equal to about 1 percent, according to early tallies. The blue-chip index also hit a new intraday high of 13,107.45 during the session. The broader S&P 500 (up 15.36 to 1,495.77, Charts) index also added 1 percent and ended at a fresh six-year high. The Nasdaq (up 23.50 to 2,548.04, Charts) added 0.9 percent and ended at a new six-year high. Treasury prices slipped, the dollar rose versus the yen and the euro, oil prices jumped while gold ended lower. Here's a look at what was moving near the close. Investors were reacting to the day's news, but also to the broader uptrend that has lifted the markets for weeks, thanks to earnings that have topped lowered forecasts and a sense of relief about the economic outlook. \\"I think we're seeing that Wall Street is resilient, which is significant after everything we've been through over the last few years,\\" said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones. He was referring to the challenges for the economy after the events of 9/11, as well as the war in Iraq - and the more recent scare about how the subprime mortgage lending fallout would impact the already struggling housing market. \\"We're seeing that the market continues to be driven by the earnings, which have been good,\\" Skrainka added. He said that investors should be able to absorb any expected slowdown in earnings growth in 2007, as it follows 3-1/2 years of double-digit percentage growth. With 44 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, earnings are currently on track to have grown 6.2 percent from a year ago, according to the latest Thomson Financial estimates. The latest spate of better-than-expected earnings included Amazon.com, Corning and Boeing. In addition to earnings, adding to the momentum Wednesday was a surprisingly strong reading on durable goods orders, which rose 3.4 percent in March, above forecasts. Another report, released today showed that March home sales rebounded by less than expected from February. In the afternoon, the Fed's \\"Beige Book\\" periodic reading on the economy showed that most areas of the country saw only moderate expansion. While the 30-stock Dow is at an all-time high, the broader S&P 500 index remains below its all-time high of 1,527.46 hit in March 2000 at the end of the late-90s tech boom. The Nasdaq composite is nowhere near its all-time high of 5048.62, also from March 2000. Although the Dow is a narrow index, its crossing of the 13,000 mark is nonetheless symbolic of the strength of the 4-1/2 year old bull market. \\"I think it means that the beat goes on and that, specifically, the underlying forces which have been driving the market for more than four years are still intact,\\" said William Hummer, principal at Wayne Hummer Inc. He said those forces included the promise of economic expansion, probability that inflation will continue to be subdued and a still confident consumer. Looking out to the rest of 2007, Hummer said that while pullbacks are necessary so as to sustain the upward trend, any such declines would probably be short lived. Stock gains were broad based, with 27 out of 30 Dow stocks rising. Leading the advance was Alcoa (up 1.80 to 35.75, Charts, Fortune 500), which jumped 5.5 percent after the aluminum maker said it was considering selling its packaging and consumer segment, responsible for about 10 percent of its 2006 revenue. The company also said it was looking to sell several other smaller units. Other big Dow gainers included IBM (up 2.89 to 101.38, Charts, Fortune 500), Intel (up 0.33 to 22.27, Charts, Fortune 500), American Express (up 1.51 to 62.42, Charts, Fortune 500) and Exxon Mobil (up 1.29 to 79.88, Charts, Fortune 500). In earnings news, Amazon.com (up 12.12 to 56.87, Charts, Fortune 500) reported higher quarterly sales and earnings that topped estimates late Tuesday. The online retailer also said second-quarter and full-year revenue would top current estimates. Shares jumped 21 percent Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning, Dow component Boeing (up 0.94 to 94.61, Charts, Fortune 500) reported higher quarterly sales and earnings that topped estimates. However, the aerospace behemoth also kept its financial forecast for 2007 unchanged. Shares inched lower. Corning (up 1.16 to 24.89, Charts, Fortune 500) shares jumped after the fiber-optics maker reported higher quarterly sales and earnings that topped estimates. On the downside, Sun Microsystems (down 0.65 to 5.29, Charts, Fortune 500) slumped after it reported higher quarterly sales that were short of forecasts late Tuesday. The company also issued a current-quarter sales forecast that is shy of estimates. The bidding war for ABN Amro (up 2.42 to 49.82, Charts) heated up after a consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland offered offered to buy the bank for more than 100 billion, just a few days after the bank agreed to be bought by Barclays (up 1.65 to 58.50, Charts). The deal would be contingent on ABN Amro breaking its deal to sell its Chicago-based LaSalle unit to Bank of America for 21 billion. Market breadth was positive. On the New York Stock Exchange, winners topped losers by more than 2 to 1 on volume of 1.35 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners 3 to 2 on volume of 2.31 billion shares. U.S. light crude oil for June delivery rose 41.26 to 65.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the release of the mixed weekly oil inventories report. COMEX gold for June delivery fell 30 cents to 687.40 an ounce. Treasury prices slipped, raising the yield on the 10-year note to 4.64 percent from 4.62 percent late Monday. Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions. In currency trading, the dollar gained modestly against the yen and was barely changed versus the euro. What was this article about?","output":"This article from April 25, 2007, discusses the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching its first-ever close above 13,000 points. The 1% gain was attributed to positive earnings reports from companies such as Amazon.com, asset sales possibilities for Alcoa, and strong economic readings at the time. The broader S&P 500 index and Nasdaq both ended at new six-year highs. The report highlights economic resilience and the ongoing growth in earnings as key drivers for the market during that period. Additionally, it mentions market reactions to news, such as Alcoa considering the sale of some of its segments, and other earnings news from companies like Boeing and Corning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the opening drive of the game, the Dolphins raced 57 yards in just 5 plays, all the way to the Patriots 23, setting up a 41-yard field goal attempt by Caleb Sturgis, but Jamie Collins blocked it, Kyle Arrington picked it up and raced 62 yards for a touchdown. After a Dolphins punt, the Pats drove 42 yards to the Dolphins 38, but Brady was intercepted by Jason Trusnik at the 34. The Dolphins drove 60 yards to the Patriots 6, but the red zone defense forced them to kick a 24-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins drove to their own 45, but Ryan Tannehill was intercepted by Duron Harmon at the Patriots 34 and returned the ball 60 yards to the Dolphins 8. Three plays later, Shane Vereen ran in a 3-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-3. Jarvis Landry returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Dolphins 37. They drove 38 yards to the Patriots 35, but Sturgis kicked a 53-yard field goal. After the next three drives ended in punts, with the first half winding down, Tannehill connected with Wallace on a 32-yard touchdown bomb with 0:05 left to trim the score to 14-13 on a play that was initially ruled a drop. After a decent offensive showing in the first half, the Patriots went on a barrage of scoring in the third quarter. After returning the kickoff 19 yards to the 21, the Patriots stormed 79 yards in just 8 plays, increasing their lead to 21-13 on LeGarrette Blount's 3-yard touchdown run. After a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots drove 47 yards to the Dolphins 17 where Gostkowski drilled a 35-yard for goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. Patrick Chung intercepted a pass on the first play of the next drive and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins 27. The Patriots cashed it in for a touchdown on the first play with Brady air mailing a 27-yard touchdown strike to Rob Gronkowski, upping the lead to 31-13. After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First Jonas Gray ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6. Brady then found Edelman for the 6-yard touchdown pass on the next play, making the score 38-13. The Dolphins drove 65 yards in 14 plays to the Patriots 25, but on 4th-and-18, Daniel Thomas could only gain 10 yards and the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots scored the final points on a 36-yarder, making the score 41-13. The Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game. The Patriots offensive line was immensely better than the opening day game against Miami as Brady wasn't sacked at all. Brady tossed 2 TDs to Edelman and Gronkowski while Vereen and Blount picked up rushing TDs. Gronkowski was their leading receiver with 96 yards and 1 touchdown on just 3 catches, and in the process secured his second 1,000 yard season. Miami picked up 384 yards of offense, but mostly couldn't get out of their own way with two turnovers and some awful drops, including a dropped touchdown by Mike Wallace.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is an odd film for me, as after I reviewed a nice film from a new film maker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer/director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film, THE CURE. I don't normally review films this way, but what the heck--I love shorts and couldn't wait to see another. Interestingly, while it turned out I did like THE CURE, I was not thrilled by it and let Jafri know. To his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway--giving it my honest appraisal. The film has tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction goes, it's exceptional--especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first film). The combination of exceptional choices of color, pacing and music that well-suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere. You really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making. However, the thing I didn't love was some of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was just too easy to foresee. I really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist. However, considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience, it bodes well for his future. Good job.

James Edward Duggan Jr. (born January 14, 1954), better known by his ring name \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan, is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE on a Legends contract. His best-known character is that of an American patriot, which sees him use a 2x4 length of wood as a weapon, the battle cry \\"Hooo!\\" and the U-S-A! cheer. In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE), Duggan was the winner of the first ever Royal Rumble match in 1988 and in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), he was a one time United States Heavyweight Champion and a one time (and the final) World Television Champion. After he lost the U.S. title to Vader, Duggan moved to the mid-card division and began wrestling on Saturday Night. He defeated Bunkhouse Buck at SuperBrawl V. He faced former WWF rival Meng (known as Haku in WWF) in a martial arts match at Uncensored, which Meng won. At The Great American Bash, he defeated Sgt. Craig Pittman by disqualification in Pittman's pay-per-view debut. At Bash at the Beach (1995), Duggan lost to Kamala.  In late 1995, Duggan started a feud with Big Bubba Rogers, which culminated in a Taped Fist match at World War 3, which Rogers won. Duggan participated in the first-ever three ring, 60 man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated. He fought Loch Ness to a double disqualification at a Main Event taping before SuperBrawl VI. Duggan then started a short feud with Diamond Dallas Page, to whom he lost in a Taped Fist match at Bash at the Beach. At World War 3, he unsuccessfully participated in a three ring 60 man battle royal to determine the #1 contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Duggan had no major pay-per-view matches for over two years before he disappeared in 1998 after he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  After successfully beating his cancer, Duggan returned to wrestling and replaced Buff Bagwell in a match against Berlyn at Fall Brawl, which Duggan lost. Soon after, Duggan became involved in a storyline where he became a janitor for WCW. Duggan then started a feud with the anti-American stable the Revolution (Shane Douglas, Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn, and Asya). At Starrcade (1999), he and his surprise partners, the newly reunited Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, and Rick Steiner), faced the Revolution in a losing effort after the Club turned on Duggan. As a result of losing, the next night on Nitro, Duggan was forced to denounce the U.S. flag but he refused to do so. In response, the Revolution attacked him and began beating him until The Filthy Animals, who were also feuding with the Revolution, saved Duggan.

The premise tells us that a woman let out a shriek of terror and quickly stood up, but it does not provide specific details about how long she had been sitting, what scared her, or whether something crept up behind her.  The hypothesis attempts to fill in some of these gaps by suggesting that the woman had been sitting for 20 minutes and that something crept up behind her, causing her fear. However, the premise doesn't provide enough information to conclude that this hypothesis is the only explanation for the woman's reaction. There could be several other reasons for her terror as well, such as hearing a sudden loud noise, witnessing a frightening event in front of her, or even experiencing a vivid recollection of a traumatic memory. Therefore, although the hypothesis might be plausible, the premise does not categorically entail the hypothesis.

Don’t wipe your brushes against the towel because this can cause the bristles to loosen and fall out. And never shake out the extra water, which can also loosen the bristles. After squeezing out the extra water, lay your brush over the edge of the table with the bristles facing downward. This will maintain the shape of the brush and prevent extra water from seeping into the head of the brush. Put a towel under the wet brushes.  Allow your brushes to dry completely overnight before you use them again. Never let your brushes dry while standing upright -- this can rust any metal parts of the handle and also loosen the glue in the head where the bristles meet the handle. Once your brushes are dry, gently fluff them out. Use your fingers to reshape your brushes if needed. You can also get the bristles slightly damp to reshape them.

The man replaced the orange linoleum in the kitchen with gray tile because the","output":"orange linoleum had become worn, outdated and no longer matched the overall aesthetic of the rest of the house. Furthermore, he wanted to upgrade to a more durable and sophisticated flooring option that would complement the contemporary design elements he had recently introduced in the kitchen renovation process. Over the years, the orange linoleum had lost its original vibrancy and luster due to constant foot traffic, spills, and stains, resulting in a dull and unappealing appearance. Besides this, linoleum is prone to tears and dents, which might have contributed to the undesirable condition of the old flooring. The man decided to stay away from linoleum for the new flooring as he realized there were better options available in the market that could withstand the test of time. When he came across gray tile options, he was impressed by their elegant appearance, durability, and ease of maintenance. Gray tiles tend to align well with most color schemes and design styles, increasing their versatility in terms of matching the existing decor and appliances. Gray flooring is also proven to be a timeless choice, retaining its appeal over the years which would ultimately add value to his home. As the man completed the task of replacing the orange linoleum with gray tiles, he noticed that the new floor enhanced the modern look of his kitchen and created a sense of cohesion with the surrounding areas of the house. The gray tiles also provided a more robust and wear-resistant surface, which is ideal for high-traffic and spill-prone areas such as a kitchen. In addition to this, the gray tiles were easier to clean and were resistant to scratches and stains, making them a practical choice for busy households with children or pets. The man appreciated that the new flooring had reduced the need for constant maintenance, allowing him to save time and effort in keeping the kitchen immaculate.  Another added benefit of the gray tiles was that they provided a more stable and comfortable surface for standing, especially when the man spent extended periods preparing meals or doing kitchen-related chores. Moreover, unlike linoleum, the tile flooring did not emit any unpleasant odors or harmful volatile organic compounds, ensuring a healthier indoor environment for the man and his family. In conclusion, the man's choice to replace the orange linoleum with gray tile flooring in the kitchen was driven by several reasons: to enhance the aesthetic appeal and cohesiveness of his home, to improve the durability and ease of maintenance, and to ensure a safer and more comfortable surface for daily kitchen activities. The result was a stunning and practical transformation that significantly uplifted the overall look and feel of his living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The chain on Monday began testing My Starbucks barista, a platform that lets customers order by voice through their phones, pay remotely, then swing by a store to pick them up, reports the Seattle Times. It works via Amazon's Alexa or through the company's iOS app. With Alexa, customers will say, \\"Alexa, order my Starbucks,\\" and the \\"usual\\" order will be placed. With the iPhone, customers will dictate their orders to the app. The beta launch is for only 1,000 customers nationwide, but the program will expand to a wider audience through the summer, then bring Android users on board later this year. Starbucks wants to offer “a very seamless digital experience where it is still customer-first, experience-first, where you don’t have to think about it,” says the company’s chief tech officer. Voice-ordering marks Starbucks’ latest digital move, building on the success of its existing mobile app, which already includes order and pay features. Customers have shown they’re into it, with those transactions accounting for 7% of the company’s US business in the latest quarter, per Fortune. And the company is expecting digital-based revenues to double in five years. But the early success also has had a backlash. Starbucks acknowledged last week the program’s popularity had undermined walk-in sales in some stores, where customers have left without ordering when they saw lines of digital customers—also waiting.

He intends to use the tractor beam to pull a meteor into the Earth, striking the polar ice caps and causing a global flood. Moments after this plan is revealed, Austin Powers and the British Secret Service attack the base and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted for his services, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. Basil Exposition later informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped, and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold. Austin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil, who tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's roller disco club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is undercover as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence mole named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo. Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront Fat Bastard, who is now a sumo wrestler, but still does work for Dr. Evil. Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, Mr. Roboto, is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember. Austin and Foxxy later meet with Mr. Roboto, who pleads ignorance about Nigel's whereabouts. Unconvinced, Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto hands Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to... The answer to this question is:","output":"No, I can't"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: A mother has slammed her son's Texas middle school for including a question about infidelity in his homework. Patricia Galvan, who helps her 12-year-old son with his school work every night, said she was shocked when she looked over the seventh-grader's science assignment. On a worksheet about genetics, one question read:. 'One of Opal's children is born with shocking red hair. Is Orville the father of this child? But wait, Opal swear she has been faithful and claims that the hospital goofed and got her baby mixed with another. Is this a plausible explanation?' Scroll down for video. Not happy: Patricia Galvan said she was shocked when her son's seventh-grade science homework included a question about infidelity. Another assignment asked him to set up a fake Match.com profile, she said. 'Inappropriate': The genetics question suggested that the mother of a newborn child had had an affair. The question left her 'appalled', Galvan told WTVR. 'I was very bothered by it,' she said. 'I'm now having to explain to my child about being unfaithful - why do I have to explain that to my 12-year-old?' The boy, who attends Harry F. Byrd Middle School in Henrico, was also given a Social Studies assignment in which he had to study a character from the 1920s and then go 'speed dating' with other class members. As part of the assignment, he also needed to create a Match.com page for the person. 'To even research what is Match.com, that opens up a whole other thing,' his mother complained. Apology: A spokesperson for Harry F. Byrd Middle School agreed the assignment should be changed. A spokesman from Henrico County Public Schools told WTVR that they 'agreed that some of the wording was not appropriate for the classroom'. 'We are thankful that the parent brought the issue to our attention, and we will be working to provide additional reminders that ensure all instructional materials are age-appropriate,' they said.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 201*v - 360*v - 291 = 345 for v.","output":"To solve the given equation, 201v - 360v - 291 = 345, for the variable v, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms (add or subtract similar variables) The equation has two terms with the variable v, which are 201v and -360v. We'll combine these like terms by performing subtraction. 201v - 360v = -159v So now our equation becomes: -159v - 291 = 345 Step 2: Isolate the variable (move constant term to the opposite side) Now we'll shift the constant term, -291, to the other side of the equation to isolate the variable term. To do this, add 291 on both sides. -159v - 291 + 291 = 345 + 291 Since -291 + 291 = 0, the equation becomes: -159v = 636 Step 3: Solve for v (divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable) Finally, to solve for v, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable -159. -159v / -159 = 636 / -159 Since -159 / -159 = 1, the equation becomes: v = 636 / -159 Now, divide 636 by -159 to obtain the value of v: v ≈ -4 So, the solution to the given equation, 201v - 360v - 291 = 345, is v ≈ -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the operating system of the ISROs supercomputer SAGA 220? Can windows or iOS be used as an OS for supercomputers? Pick your answer from:  -no.  -yes.","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning, as they pertain to different topics. Here, I will address each question separately with a detailed answer. Question 1: \\"What is the difference between an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and a gate turn-off thyristor (GTO)?\\" Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) and Gate Turn-Off Thyristor (GTO) are both power electronic devices used for switching applications, but they have different structural and operational characteristics. 1. IGBT: An IGBT is a three-terminal semiconductor device that is a combination of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) and a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The IGBT has a gate (G), collector (C), and emitter (E) terminal. Its voltage control feature allows it to have relatively low conduction losses and high switching speeds. IGBTs are known for their efficiency, excellent thermal performance, and ease of use in various power electronic applications, including motor control, power supplies, renewable energy systems, and electric vehicles. 2. GTO: A GTO is a four-layer, three-terminal semiconductor device belonging to the thyristor family. The GTO has a gate (G), anode (A), and cathode (K) terminal. Unlike conventional thyristors, GTOs can be turned off using the gate terminal by applying a negative voltage. This feature enables GTOs to have faster turn-off times and improved controllability, making them suitable for high-power and high-voltage applications, such as traction control systems, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems, and variable-speed drives. In summary, the main differences between IGBTs and GTOs are: 1. IGBTs are voltage-controlled devices, while GTOs are current-controlled devices. 2. IGBTs offer easier gate drive requirements due to the MOSFET input structure, while GTOs require complex gate drive circuits for turn-on and turn-off operations. 3. IGBTs provide lower conduction losses and higher switching speeds than GTOs. 4. IGBTs are generally used in lower voltage and moderate power applications, while GTOs are employed in high voltage and high power applications. Question 2: \\"What is the operating system of the ISRO's supercomputer SAGA 220? Can Windows or iOS be used as an operating system for supercomputers?\\" The Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) SAGA 220 supercomputer utilizes the Linux operating system, specifically a Linux-based variant known as GARUDA. This operating system is favored in high-performance computing (HPC) environments because of its flexibility, stability, and performance optimization capabilities. Linux usually has better resource management and can provide faster communication between computing nodes, which is critical for supercomputers to function optimally. While Windows and iOS are designed for general consumer use and cater to a wide range of devices, they are not typically used as operating systems for supercomputers. Windows and iOS may not offer the same level of customization, stability, and resource management as Linux-based operating systems do in high-performance computing environments. However, there are instances where the Windows operating system has been used in supercomputers, but it is not a common practice as most supercomputers implement Linux-based operating systems. iOS is not used in supercomputers, as it is specifically developed for mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads and does not cater to the specific needs and requirements of supercomputers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Pawan Kalyan  for the following movie plot:  Sanjay Sahu (Pawan Kalyan) is a post-graduate from Osmania University and is working as a gym instructor.

Let's justify this by explaining their characteristics. 1. Understanding the term \\"lozenge\\": A lozenge is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length and opposite sides parallel to each other. 2. Comparing it with a rhombus: A rhombus is defined as a quadrilateral with all its sides equal in length and opposite sides parallel to each other. Since the defining features of a lozenge are the same as those of a rhombus, a lozenge can be called rhombus-shaped. 3. Comparing it with a diamond shape: The term \\"diamond\\" is often used informally to describe a rhombus shape, especially when the angles are close to, but not necessarily equal to, 90 degrees. Although not an official geometrical term, the diamond shape has a strong visual resemblance to a lozenge, so it can be called diamond-shaped.

And I was wondering How would Casey feel afterwards? Answer:","output":"It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how Casey would feel, as individual reactions vary depending on factors such as personality, the specific situation, and past experiences. However, we can attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of some possible emotional responses Casey might have in this situation. 1. Relief: In the short term, Casey might experience a sense of relief from avoiding a potentially confronting or uncomfortable interaction with their parents. If they had been feeling particularly anxious or stressed about the prospect of talking to their parents, consciously deciding to avoid them could temporarily alleviate those negative emotions. 2. Guilt: Casey might begin to feel guilty about not talking to their parents, especially if their parents were only attempting to communicate out of genuine concern or love. Guilt can arise from the realization that their avoidance might have hurt their parents emotionally or caused unnecessary misunderstandings and tension in their relationship. 3. Fear: If Casey's avoidance of their parents was due to a fear of conflict or potential negative outcomes, they might continue to feel fear even after avoiding them. This is because they have not resolved the underlying issue and may still worry about what will happen when they eventually have to face their parents. 4. Frustration: Depending on the circumstances, Casey might feel frustrated with themselves for avoiding their parents. They may recognize that their actions were counterproductive and only served to prolong the inevitable confrontation that they will need to face. This frustration could prompt negative thoughts and self-criticism, which may further exacerbate Casey's emotional turmoil. 5. Loneliness: When avoiding close or important relationships, such as family, people can experience feelings of loneliness. Casey could feel isolated and disconnected from their parents, making them long for emotional support and understanding. 6. Regret: Over time, Casey might begin to regret their decision to avoid their parents. This could stem from the realization that open communication and resolution would have been better for everyone involved, instead of prolonging the situation through avoidance. 7. Mixed emotions: It is also highly possible that Casey may experience a combination of these emotions, making their feelings complex and difficult to navigate. They might feel relief in the short term, but this might be accompanied by guilt, fear, or frustration as they continue to avoid addressing the issue with their parents. In conclusion, Casey's emotional response to avoiding their parents would likely result from a mix of relief, guilt, fear, frustration, loneliness, or regret. It is essential for Casey to recognize and address these emotions in order to work through the situation and foster a healthy relationship with their parents moving forward. Open communication, understanding, and a mutual willingness to resolve the issue will be critical to overcoming these emotional challenges and finding a positive outcome for both Casey and their parents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \\"May I help you?\\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \\"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

In recent years, an unconventional approach to traditional philosophy has gained traction, breaking away from the intellectual armchair and embracing the scientific method. Experimental Philosophy – or \\"X-Phi\\" for short – blurs the boundaries between philosophy and science to investigate how people think about classical philosophic questions. New York Times delves into this fascinating field to explore its aims, methods, and potential for transforming the study of Philosophy. The Evolution of Philosophy: The Birth of X-Phi Step 2: Offer some historical context for the emergence of Experimental Philosophy. Over the past decades, numerous philosophers have grown dissatisfied with armchair introspection as the predominant method for examining issues, such as ethics, epistemology, and the nature of consciousness. Experimental Philosophy emerged as a response to this dissatisfaction, combining empirical research techniques, such as surveys and psychological experiments, with philosophical inquiry. The resulting interdisciplinary field seeks to challenge assumptions and biases that could have gone unnoticed in a more conventional approach. Investigating Foundations of Philosophical Debates Through Empirical Methods Step 3: Explain the main methods used by experimental philosophers. Experimental philosophers conduct controlled experiments or rely on observational data to test how ordinary people respond to philosophical problems. The use of questionnaires, thought experiments, and cognitive science technologies, such as neuroimaging, has allowed experimental philosophers to collect and analyze empirical data with unprecedented detail. This research process sheds light on the process by which people form their intuitions and beliefs about some of the most pressing philosophical dilemmas.  Results: Challenging Traditional Philosophical Intuitions  Step 4: Discuss the implications and contributions of Experimental Philosophy. Experimental Philosophy has already made significant contributions to multiple areas in Philosophy. For instance, it has challenged prevalent theories of knowledge (such as semantic intuitions), questioned the role of intuition in moral judgments, and investigated whether cultural differences affect people's understanding of concepts like causation and free will. These findings have led to lively debates within the philosophical community, urging scholars to reconsider their assumptions and methods. The Future of Experimental Philosophy and Its Limitations Step 5: Examine the potential future impact of Experimental Philosophy and acknowledge its limitations. While Experimental Philosophy has shown promise in generating new insights, it is essential to recognize its limitations. Critics argue that relying solely on empirical methods might overlook the more abstract, theoretical aspects of philosophical inquiry. Nevertheless, proponents of X-Phi maintain that empirical data can help philosophers refine their intuitions, a vital step towards a more accurate understanding of the world. As the field continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Experimental Philosophy will eventually reshape the academic landscape or retain its complementary role within the broader field of Philosophy. Conclusion Step 6: Provide a concise conclusion that summarises the article. Experimental Philosophy represents a groundbreaking approach to philosophical investigation, bridging the gap between philosophical inquiry and empirical research methods. By scrutinizing the underpinnings of classical philosophic questions, X-Phi has the potential to reshape centuries-old debates and advance our understanding of human nature and cognition. As the field continues to grow, philosophers and scientists alike are keeping a watchful eye on the exciting developments emerging from this cross-disciplinary endeavor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do offshore drilling platforms move from place to place? What is the offshore rig move activity? Pick from: + no + yes","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning, but they are related. The first question, \\"How do offshore drilling platforms move from place to place?\\", is asking about the actual process or method used to move these platforms to different locations. It is focused on the technology or means of transportation that enable the physical relocation of drilling platforms in the offshore environment. Offshore drilling platforms can be divided into two main categories: mobile and fixed. Mobile offshore platforms include jack-up rigs, semisubmersible rigs, and drillships, while fixed platforms may be more challenging to move.  1. Jack-up rigs have legs that can be jacked up or down. They are towed to the new location by tugs, using their anchors or mooring systems. When the platform reaches the desired location, the legs are lowered to the seabed, and the platform is jacked up out of the water to the desired height above the sea surface. 2. Semisubmersible rigs are large platforms with underwater pontoons that can be ballasted or de-ballasted to achieve the desired level of buoyancy. They can be moved using their onboard thrusters and dynamic positioning systems or towed by tugs to the next location.  3. Drillships are specialized vessels designed to carry out deepwater drilling. They have their own propulsion systems and dynamic positioning equipment, enabling them to navigate and move to different locations as required. The second question, \\"What is the offshore rig move activity?\\", pertains to the broader set of operational actions, planning, and coordination required to facilitate the relocation of an offshore drilling platform. Offshore rig move activity is not limited to physical transportation but encompasses the whole process of preparing, moving, and establishing the drilling platform at a new location. Offshore rig move activities include, but are not limited to: 1. Planning and coordination: Assessing the route, determining the required personnel and equipment, calculating costs and risks, and coordinating with all stakeholders involved in the move. 2. Pre-move preparations: Ensuring that all relevant equipment and systems on the drilling platform are in optimal condition for the move, securing or disassembling any loose items, and obtaining the necessary permits. 3. Actual move: Coordinating tugboats or other methods of transportation, monitoring weather and sea conditions, and ensuring the platform is safely towed or navigated to the destination. 4. Post-move activities: Positioning the platform in the designated new location, ensuring compliance with local regulations, and setting up the drilling platform for further operations. In conclusion, while the two questions discuss related topics, they are not synonymous. The first question focuses specifically on the methods and technologies used to physically move offshore drilling platforms, while the second one deals with the overall process and activities involved in relocating these platforms."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He had learned that his biological mothr had died not long before. \\"My name is Davion and I've been in foster care   since I was born,\\" he said, \\"but I'm not giving up hope. \\" The heartbreaking appeal spread quickly, and Only's foster agency received calls from more than 10,000 people. Only ended up travelling to Ohio to live with a family. But after Only got into a physical fight with one of his elder would-be brothers, the family changed their minds. Back in Florida, Only passed through four different temporary homes over the following year, until he called Connie Going, his adoption case worker, to make a special request. Only had known Going for nearly ten years, and had asked every year if she would adopt him, but she always hesitated. \\"I always believed there was a better family than us out there,\\" Going said in an interview. But last July, when Only called and asked again if she might adopt him, Going said something felt different. \\"When he asked me, my heart felt this ache and I just knew he was my son,\\" she said. So Going, 52, invited Only to start spending time with the rest of her family-her two daughters, Sydney, 21, and Carly 17, and a son Taylor, 14, who she also adopted out of foster care.  Eventually, after seeing how well the arrangement was working, Going, who had rented a bigger home, started adopting Only.

Karageorge, 22, was found dead Sunday, four days after he was last seen, in a dumpster a block from his home just south of Ohio State's campus. Police said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though a final analysis was pending.      \\"We knew he had a lot of concussions. But you never knew he was depressed or anything like that,\\" Bennett said on a conference call with reporters to preview Saturday's Big Ten Championship against Wisconsin. \\"I think he was one of the most positive out of everybody, which goes to show you can't tell when something sneaks up. There's just no way to notice it.      \\"Kosta was always positive, always thankful, so appreciative of everything football gave him and that everybody in his life gave him.      \\"We knew he had a lot of concussions and we were worried about that. But we didn't see any side effects of it.\\"      Asked if Karageorge's concussions were previously from his three years as an Ohio State wrestler or from his first year as a walkon football player on the scout team, helping the starters prepare for games each week, Bennett said, \\"Both.\\"      \\"He never reported them,\\" Bennett said. \\"Kosta, I've said it before, I think he was the toughest guy I ever met. He must have been dealing with a lot of stuff internally. He was so appreciative of everything and so hard working, when he got one during practice, or something like that, he wouldn't tell anybody.      \\"We would tell him to take it easy, if you want to sit out nobody is going to judge you, anything like that, because those are serious. But his mentality was always never quit, never back down from a challenge.      \\"Concussions are one of those things, it's not a challenge, it's bigger than that.\\"      Ohio State announced before coach Urban Meyer's news conference on Monday that issues regarding Karageorge's medical history would not be addressed.      \\"I can say this, this is the best group of medical people I've ever been around, the way they handle their business and the attention to detail,\\" Meyer said, when asked.      Karageorge's family said he wrote a text message to them just before he was last seen early Wednesday that he apologized if he embarrassed them but his concussions had been affecting him. His sister, Sophia, told the New York Times that her brother had at least four or five concussions in his life.      Ohio State football released a statement from team doctor Jim Borchers on Friday while Kostageorge was still missing.      \\"While we are not able to discuss or comment about the medical care regarding our student-athletes,\\" Borchers said, \\"we are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.\\" ||||| Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed OSU Coach on Player's Death: 'It's Difficult' 1:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      An Ohio coroner on Monday ordered a special examination to look for signs of traumatic brain injury in the Ohio State football player who apparently shot himself to death.      The body of the player, Kosta Karageorge, was found in a trash bin on Sunday. His mother, Susan, told police that her son had suffered several concussions and had bouts of extreme confusion.      She said he sent her a text message four days before his body was found, saying that concussions had messed up his head. “I am sorry if I am an embarrassment,” the text said.      The coroner, Dr. Anahi Ortiz of Franklin County, told NBC News that the special examination, in which a pathologist will examine slides from the player’s brain, was not routine but has been conducted in other cases.      In this case, she said, it was because of Karageorge’s reported history of concussions and because he played football and wrestled.      Earlier on Monday, Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer said he had been told not to talk about Karageorge’s medical history. A team doctor has also said he cannot comment on the medical care of athletes.      The Ohio State wrestling coach told The Columbus Dispatch that Karageorge, who wrestled for the Buckeyes for three years, had no documented concussions.      Meyer called the apparent suicide an \\"incredible tragedy.\\"      \\"We’ll never get over it,\\" he said.      Karageorge was a walk-on and was recognized Saturday on Senior Day as the Buckeyes beat archrival Michigan. Ohio State plays for the Big Ten championship this weekend. “To overcome the incredible tragedy that happened last night this is a real challenge,” Meyer said.      A growing body of research shows that repeated concussions can cause permanent brain damage, and organized football has come under criticism for ignoring the danger for too long.      A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement under which the NFL would pay thousands of former players for concussion claims. She did so only after the NFL agreed to remove a 675 million cap on damages.      In college sports, the NCAA has proposed spending 70 million on a program that would monitor athletes for brain trauma.      And The Associated Press reported over the weekend that a former high school quarterback in Illinois is suing a state governing body for not doing enough to protect him from concussions. The organization says reducing concussion risk is a priority.      Ohio State students said Monday they were saddened by the death.      “It’s really disheartening to see that someone at, you know, one of the happiest and best universities in the country felt like that, and then didn’t realize or didn’t want to take advantage of the resources that we have possible here,” said Josh Ahart, who is studying public affairs. “So we need to do better as a university and as a family.”      OSU Student Body President Celia Wright, a senior studying public health, called the entire episode \\"disturbing.\\"      \\"Partly because it was such a high-profile thing,\\" said Wright, \\"and partly because he seemed to define what we as a society envision as healthy.\\"      Play Facebook      Twitter      Embed Ohio State Students Shocked by Karageorge Death 2:07 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog      IN-DEPTH      SOCIAL      .@OSUCoachMeyer: It's been a tough week.

Paramedics think she was attacked by some type of animal. Doctors perform an emergency C-Section, and her baby (a boy) is born alive just as she dies.Thirty years later a young man named Dennis (Kenny Johnson) is riding in a car with an attractive redhead named Racquel (Traci Lords) heading to an underground nightclub (located, oddly, in a slaughterhouse) somewhere in Los Angeles. After addressing the doorman in Russian, Racquel brings the young man into the club. The man is confused and trying to understand the rules of the club. Some of the regulars indifferently push him aside. Saying he needs a drink, the sprinkler suddenly system activates, raining blood down on everyone inside. It is then that he (and the audience) realizes that everyone in the club is a vampire.Dennis desperately tries to get away and winds up at the feet of a menacing figure in a black-leather trenchcoat. The vampires look on this figure with awe, mumbling the words: \\"it's the Daywalker!\\" This is our first look at Blade (Wesley Snipes), the vampire killer.Blade pulls out a shotgun and opens fire on the vampires, who instantly burn to ashes when killed. When the gun is knocked out of his hands by Racquel, Blade uses a set of silver stakes to kill Racquel and more vampires, including the disk jockey. Soon all the vamps are either dead or have fled except for one; a heavyset vamp named Quinn (Donal Logue), whom Blade has apparently run into before. Blade pins Quinn to the wall, and then sets him on fire before confronting the last member in the club (the human man from the beginning). Finding no vampire bite marks on Dennis, Blade lets him live and makes his escape as the police arrive.Quinn is extinguished and taken to the local hospital.

Not only will meditation get you a clearer, more thoughtful, tuned-in mind, but it can help lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, too. Just 10-15 minutes each day can leave you feeling zoned and zenned for the next 24 hours.  If you're not the meditating type, other activities can substitute for this feeling. Take a walk in your favorite local park, or just sit on a bench and read. Grab a journal and spend some time writing down your thoughts. Anything that's a bit of \\"me-time\\" will do the trick. Do people playfully tease you and tell you to take a hike? Perhaps you should tease them back and actually do it.  Live in the moment by practicing such techniques as mindfulness and Zen driving. Contemplating the mysteries of science (the universe, quantum theory) can also be an intensely introspective experience. One way to shift focus (and be more observant, as mentioned above) is by keeping a journal. Commit to a daily writing practice and ask yourself questions like:   What did I feel? Why? What did I learn today? Who did I learn from? What ideas arrived? Who or what did I think about today? How was today different than yesterday? Than last week? Than last year?  What can I be grateful for? Who in our world seems lonely? Why? While there's no shame in asking for help, your quiet confidence will give you the strength to do it yourself, which in turn will make you more valuable to others. And when you do need to ask for help, your introspective nature will enable you to focus and to ask the right questions. When you can spend time alone with yourself doing quiet, thoughtful things, it’ll be easier to do the same in larger groups. And you’ll probably be surprised how much you enjoy it as well. You'll cultivate patience and nurture your inner world, as well as provide yourself with more conversation material when it's time to socialize. Try knitting, zen gardening or some other activity that doesn't require extraneous talking. Even just picking up a good book is a start.  In her book What Do I Say Next?, Mingling Maven Susan RoAne writes, \\"Still waters run deep ... but they can also be shallow.\\" If you're shallow, people will be glad you're shutting up, and you don't want that. You want to improve yourself and become someone that other people want to be around, even if you're not chatty. Also remember that quiet people can also do things loud people do. You can try singing, dancing, playing an instrument, etc. Remember to transition back to a quiet person when you're done. However, when your free time is spent being quiet, it'll be harder to make the transition into being louder in other situations, as quietude often sets the mood for your social interactions later. Imagine spending all day reading your favorite book, getting totally enveloped, and then going to a party. You'll probably still be off in book world, feeling naturally quieter and more introverted. Author Susan Cain says that \\"quiet is a catalyst for innovation.\\" Being alone with your thoughts can be some of the most rewarding, productive time spent in your day. And you get to do exactly what you want to do. This will not only be quality time doing whatever you want, but you'll learn to be with just yourself and like it, too. This could be time spent perfecting your new hobby, writing in your journal, taking the dog for a walk, or going on a spontaneous trip to the grocery store. It's not important what you do, just that you do it. You'll learn that interactions with others don't make or break a good time. On the other hand, don't become a recluse, but do use your \\"alone time\\" to nurture your creativity. Surrounding yourself with bustling, gregarious, bubbly people will only make you more bustling, gregarious, and bubbly. To learn to appreciate friends on a lower key and sometimes even in silence, spend time with more introverted, naturally quieter people. You’ll find that it’s a completely new and different kind of fun. Quiet people often tend to hang out with quiet people, though this is not always the case. If you don't know that many quiet people, ask your quietest friend and meet their friends. Having a friend's support is often helpful, especially if they're already the quiet type (or trying to be). Alternatively, join more notoriously quiet activities — try a book club or a cooking class to meet quieter individuals. Not only will this give you that much-needed time to talk about yourself, but you can also talk about why you feel you need to be quieter, and whether you demand other people's attention. Therapists aren't only for people who have mental disorders, but also for people who want to get in touch with themselves. If someone is making you feel like you’re too loud, you can talk about that, too. You’re probably just fine as you are, unless you feel it’s a problem. Being comfortable in your natural personality is very important. At the end of the day, some people are just naturally louder than others. You don’t have to be quieter — you’re probably just fine as you are. However, if you do feel compelled to change, only make changes that feel okay and genuine. If you want to speak up, do it. If you want to dance in the cafeteria, do it. All of us are dynamic individuals with more than one side to us. Maybe you just have a quiet side that comes out once in a while. If you genuinely do feel the need to be quieter, choose times when you feel this is the most important. At dinner with family? During class? Don't aim to be a quiet person; aim to be quieter in the right circumstances. There may be times when being loud is called for. . Maybe you can be completely silent for an hour. Then try three hours. If you can make it to a whole day, you might find yourself observing more around you that you never noticed before because you were too busy talking. A good time to begin such a \\"vow of silence\\" is after a procedure that causes pain in the mouth or head, such as braces adjustments, root canals, or even a minor bonk on the head. Don't hurt yourself, of course, but do look for inspiration to become a quiet person. What is a summary?","output":"Quietude can lead to personal growth, improved mental health, and better social interactions. Incorporating 10-15 minutes of meditation or \\"me-time\\" each day can promote mindfulness and help develop a tranquil disposition. Engaging in peaceful activities, such as journaling, walking in nature, or zen gardening, can offer opportunities for introspection and self-reflection. Spending time with introverted individuals and participating in serene pursuits may foster an appreciation for quieter interactions. Embracing a balance between introversion and extroversion allows for diverse self-expression, while ensuring the need to be quieter is genuine and contextually appropriate. Temporary periods of silence, such as a day-long vow of silence, can provide a unique perspective on observation and listening. Ultimately, cultivating quiet habits and embracing quiet moments benefits personal growth, creativity, and social well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Not long after , Shorey and Ian showed up . I have not laughed this hard in years , basically at Ian and Shoreys joke about Dan 's manhood . Question What might   I mean when I say I laughed at Shorey 's joke about Dan 's manhood ? Answer:","output":"When you say that you laughed at Shorey's joke about Dan's manhood, it suggests that Shorey made a humorous comment or observation related to some aspect of Dan's masculinity or male characteristics. This could be related to his physical appearance, behavior, or some other trait that is typically associated with being a man. The joke may have been meant in a lighthearted and playful manner, and you found it amusing and entertaining, leading you to laugh. Laughter can be a way to bond with others and create shared experiences, so when you say that you haven't laughed this hard in years, it indicates that the gathering you were attending brought about a moment of joy, amusement, and connection among the group. The fact that you laughed so much suggests that the joke was exceptionally funny to you, possibly due to its unexpectedness, cleverness, or how well it captured Dan's personality. Moreover, the presence of Shorey and Ian added more dynamic and fun elements to the conversation, and their joke about Dan's manhood contributed to this atmosphere. The joke might have been a form of friendly teasing, which can be a normal part of socializing and bonding. In this context, you laughing at the joke would be a way to appreciate the humor and participate in the social dynamic of the group. It's important to note that, while laughter can be expressive of enjoyment and connection with others, it can also sometimes unintentionally cause discomfort or embarrassment if the subject of the joke is sensitive for the person involved. Therefore, it is essential to be sensitive to the reactions of others when sharing or laughing at jokes to ensure that the shared experience remains positive and inclusive for everyone in the group. In conclusion, when you say you laughed at Shorey's joke about Dan's manhood, it means that you found the humorous comment related to an aspect of Dan's masculinity amusing and entertaining. This shared laughter allowed you to connect with your friends and enjoy a particularly memorable and lighthearted moment together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: what was william gladstone considered? Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

GT owners can replicate it by ordering the Ford Racing Drag Pack, Handling Pack and Super Pack. The Drag Pack adds heavy duty half shafts and a new rear subframe that help optimize the Mustang's new independent rear suspension for drag racing, while the Handling Pack lowers the car one inch and comes with special rear shocks and a new stabilizer bar.

Write an article based on this \\"A Lincolnshire relationship counselling charity said it was \\"deeply shocking\\" it has been forced to close all 10 of its centres across the county.\\"","output":"Title: \\"Relationship Counselling Charity Faces Closure in Lincolnshire: The Impact on the Community\\" Introduction: The people of Lincolnshire have been left reeling after a local relationship counselling charity recently announced it was \\"deeply shocking\\" it has been forced to close all 10 of its centres across the county. This unexpected news has sent shivers down the spines of many, as countless couples and families have benefitted from the counselling services offered by the charity. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind the closure, examine its impact on the community, and explore the available options for those seeking relationship support in Lincolnshire. Reasons for Closure: (Step 1: Investigate the reasons behind the closure) Although specific details surrounding the closure have yet to be released, many speculate financial hardship, lack of funding, and limited resources are driving factors. Furthermore, the ongoing impact of the global pandemic and the subsequent economic strain could have exacerbated the charity's struggle for survival. As a consequence, they have had to make the difficult decision to shut down all their branches, leaving many couples and families without access to their much-needed services. Impact on the Community: (Step 2: Analyze how the closure will affect the community) The closure of all 10 centres across Lincolnshire is a huge blow to the community. As a charity dedicated to providing relationship support to couples and families, these centres were instrumental in helping people deal with issues such as communication, trust, and conflict resolution. Losing this essential resource means that many residents may now struggle to find similar support services, which could consequently lead to a rise in relationship breakdowns, divorces, and mental health issues within the community. Alternative Options for Relationship Support: (Step 3: Suggest other sources of support for those in need) It is important for the affected individuals and families of Lincolnshire to know that there are still options available when it comes to relationship counselling and support. Online platforms, such as Zoom or Skype, provide opportunities for people to connect with therapists remotely. While this might not necessarily replace the physical presence that the charity offered, it can be a crucial lifeline for those who desperately need assistance. Moreover, organizations like Relate and Marriage Care offer nationwide services and support that those affected by the closure can access. Reaching out to local churches, community centres, and health facilities might also reveal local initiatives and programs that provide relationship support in various forms. Call to Action: (Step 4: Encourage readers to act in the face of this closure) With these essential services disappearing from Lincolnshire, it is imperative for local communities to come together and support one another in any way possible. By reaching out to friends, family, and neighbours, and keeping an eye on local resources, residents can ensure that they are aware of any alternative sources of support or counselling services. Additionally, fundraising efforts to restore vital services or to support new relationship counselling programs can be crucial in bolstering the community's resilience. Conclusion: While the closure of all 10 centres in the Lincolnshire relationship counselling charity might seem like a dark day for the residents, there is still hope for those in need of relationship support. By turning to the resources available locally and online, the people of Lincolnshire can overcome this challenge and continue to nurture healthy, thriving relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Immaculate Conception: Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \\"prepurified\\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \\"purified\\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \\"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \\"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \\"pre purification\\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \\"all pure seed\\" of Joachim and the womb \\"wider than heaven\\" of St. Ann. How did some view the the person whose name includes a Christian rite of passage from the Bible?","output":"It sounds like you're asking about John the Baptist, who was named after a Christian rite of passage, baptism. In this article, he's mentioned as being special because some folks believed he was very holy, or really, really good and close to God. However, it says that Mary, who was believed to be super, super holy, even more holy than John after he was made holy while still in his mommy's belly. That might sound a bit weird, but it's just to say that they thought of both John and Mary as really important and special people in their faith.

Question: Information:  - Guyana (pronounced or ), officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With , Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay, Suriname and French Guiana.  - A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.  - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.  - Lethem is a town in Guyana , located in the Upper Takutu - Upper Essequibo Region of the South American Country . It is named after Sir Gordon James Lethem , who was the Governor of British Guiana from 1941 to 12 April 1947 .  - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname.  - A constituent state is a territorial and constitutional entity forming part of a sovereign state. A constituent state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and is a form of regional government.  - British Guiana (also spelled Guyana) was the name of the British colony on the northern coast of South America, since 1966 known as the independent nation of Guyana. Its indigenous people are the Arawak-speaking Lucayan, part of the Taino people.  - Suriname (or , also spelled Surinam), officially known as the Republic of Suriname, is a sovereign state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America. It is bordered by French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the west and Brazil to the south. At just under , it is the smallest country in South America. Suriname has a population of approximately 566,000, most of whom live on the country's north coast, in and around the capital and largest city, Paramaribo.  - Aishalton is an Amerindian village that is situated in the Rupununi savannah of southern Guyana, in the Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo Region (Region 9) of the country. It is the administrative centre for the southern sub-district of Region 9. In 2002, an official census recorded a population of 1,063 people in Aishalton, making it the second most highly populated village in Region 9 (after Lethem), and the most populated village in the southern sub-district. The village is predominantly inhabited by Wapishana peoples.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km, with half of its 244,118 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union.  - Established in 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purposes are to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes. The secretariat headquarters is based in Georgetown, Guyana.  - East Berbice-Corentyne (Region 6) is one of ten regions in Guyana covering the whole of the east of the country. It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Suriname to the east, Brazil to the south and the regions of Mahaica-Berbice, Upper Demerara-Berbice, Potaro-Siparuni and Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo to the west.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - Potaro-Siparuni (Region 8) is a region in Guyana, bordering the region of Cuyuni-Mazaruni to the north, the regions of Upper Demerara-Berbice and East Berbice-Corentyne to the east, the region of Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo to the south and Brazil to the west.  - Upper Takutu-Upper Esequibo (Region 9) is a region of Guyana bordering the region of Potaro-Siparuni to the north, the region of East Berbice-Corentyne to the east and Brazil to the south and west. It contains the towns Aishalton, Lethem, Good Hope and Surama. It is also the largest region of Guyana. Sir John Noe was an English missionary there.  - The Arawak are a group of indigenous peoples of South America and historically of the Caribbean. Specifically, the term \\"Arawak\\" has been applied at various times to the Lokono of South America and the Taíno, who historically lived in the Greater Antilles and northern Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, all of whom spoke related Arawakan languages.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.    What is the relationship between 'lethem' and 'city'?

Monotheists hold that there is only one god, and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names. The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in Hinduism and Sikhism.

Islam's most fundamental concept is tawhid (meaning \\"oneness\\" or \\"uniqueness\\"). God is described in the Quran as: \\"Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\\" Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism.

Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki served as the second president of South Africa, following Nelson Mandela, from June 14, 1999, to September 24, 2008. Mbeki was a key figure in South African politics and a renowned leader in the African National Congress (ANC), a political party that played a crucial role in the fight against apartheid. Born on June 18, 1942, in Idutywa, Eastern Cape, South Africa, Mbeki is the son of prominent ANC leader Govan Mbeki. Throughout his life, Thabo Mbeki has been deeply involved in politics. In 1961, he started working for the ANC and continued his political activities even after he went to England to complete his education between 1962 and 1966. He later joined the University of Sussex, where he obtained a master's degree in Economics in 1966. After graduation, Mbeki returned to Africa and played a significant role in promoting anti-apartheid movements in various African countries, including Botswana, Swaziland, and Nigeria. He also worked closely with Oliver Tambo, former ANC president, in the international campaign against apartheid. Upon his return to South Africa in 1990, he became involved in the negotiation process that led to the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic South Africa. Mbeki was a leader in South Africa's transition to democracy, and his presidency focused on issues such as economic growth and development, foreign policy, and good governance. In terms of the African Union (AU), which is mentioned in the sentence, Thabo Mbeki played an influential role in the development of this organization, believing that African countries should be self-reliant and independent of conditional aid from developed countries.

She has also been on the cover of Vogue Italia and i-D. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Adwoa Aboah is an American fashion model","output":"The next sentence, \\"Adwoa Aboah is an American fashion model,\\" does not accurately follow the preceding text. According to the information provided, Adwoa Aboah is a British fashion model of Ghanaian origin. Although it is mentioned that she appeared on the cover of American Vogue, this does not mean that she is an American fashion model herself. Instead, she could be referred to as an international fashion model, as her work is recognized in both the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other countries. Adwoa Aboah, born on 18 May 1992, has made significant strides in the fashion industry by being featured on the covers of reputed magazines such as American Vogue (alongside models Liu Wen, Ashley Graham, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Imaan Hammam, and Vittoria Ceretti), Vogue Italia, and i-D. She is not only known for her exceptional ability as a fashion model but also as a feminist activist. Aboah often uses her platform and influence to advocate for a variety of essential issues, including mental health and women's rights.  Moreover, Aboah is the founder of Gurls Talk, an online community that offers a safe space for young women to discuss subjects such as mental health, education, self-care, and activism. This initiative further solidifies her commitment to fostering support and empowerment for women globally. In conclusion, referring to Adwoa Aboah as an American fashion model does not accurately represent the information provided about her origin and background. Instead, it is more appropriate to recognize her as a British fashion model with Ghanaian ancestry who has made an international impact in the world of modeling and activism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
