It's super fun but also a little scary at times. It's like when you play hide and seek but here, Nemo's dad has to find him because he gets lost in the big, big ocean. I really like how Nemo's dad, Marlin, never gives up. He goes all the way across the ocean to find Nemo! It shows how important it is to always be there for your family, and to never give up, no matter how hard things get. And remember Dory, the blue fish? She can't remember things well but still she's always happy and making jokes, and helps Marlin a lot. She reminds us to keep smiling, even when things are tough. The movie also shows us how beautiful the ocean is, with all kinds of fish and creatures living there together. It's like a giant playground under the water! The drawings - we call them \\"animation\\" - in the movie are brilliant and colorful too! They make the ocean come alive on screen, almost like you're swimming with Nemo and his friends.

Here's a collection of insights into what the players eat before a match and while they're on the course. Bill Haas, winner of the 2011 FedEx Cup and player in the U.S. Open, is known for not eating much on the course, but when he does, he munches on a mixture of dried berries and nuts. His opponent, Jim Furyk is more inclined to eat during a match, opting for energy bars (and Larabars, specifically) between rounds. Tiger Woods, the 2008 U.S. Open champion, is often seen eating a piece of fruit, like an apple or banana, during a match. He also recently tweeted that his favorite thing to snack on while on the course is a peanut butter and banana sandwich and almonds. Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion, maintains a healthy diet filled with fruits, vegetables, and plenty of Vitamin D and calcium to keep his bones strong. On the course he likes to keep energy bars on hand to sustain him; Furyk is particularly fond of Larabars. Acclaimed golfer Phil Mickelson initially adopted a vegetarian diet in 2010 after being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, but after five months he went back to eating meat. Mickelson still maintains a vegetable-heavy diet, but supplements with lean meats and proteins. He has been spotted eating fruit, specifically bananas, and drinking water on the course. Swedish golf pro Carl Pettersson takes a fairly unconventional approach to dieting — after winning his fifth PGA Tour event this year he was quoted as saying that his diet, \\"10 beers and a tub of ice cream before bed,\\" was the key to his success. He says that he tried maintaining a strict diet a few years ago but it poorly affected his golf game. When he's out on the course, Keegan Bradley likes to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on multigrain bread, almonds, raisins, peanuts, trail mix and always packs a few Clif Bars.

Seamus nodded in agreement, feeling a newfound sense of power and confidence. These swords, which once seemed like insurmountable obstacles, were now tools for them to utilize in their endeavors. The Aelf, who humbly accepted their praise, explained that these swords were no ordinary weapons. The first was the Sword of Righteousness, known to wield the power of light and capable of penetrating the darkness and banishing evil. The second was the Sword of Shadows, a mysterious sword that could help its bearer vanish into the shadows and move unseen. With these swords, Paddy and Seamus would now be a formidable duo, able to face any challenge that lay ahead. However, the Aelf warned them to use the swords responsibly, as the powers they held were not to be taken lightly. He instructed them to only use the swords in times of great need, as they were not meant to be brandished through petty disputes or malevolent intentions. Purity of heart and clear conscience were key to properly harnessing the swords' powers. Paddy and Seamus, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the gifts they had received, thanked the Aelf profusely. They vowed to never misuse the swords and to always act with honor and integrity on their journey. In the days that followed, Paddy and Seamus traveled far and wide, using their newfound powers to face thrilling challenges. The impact of their swords was felt not only on their enemies but also on the creatures and people they encountered throughout their adventures. With the Sword of Righteousness, they would often banish evil creatures that had been terrorizing villages, restoring peace and hope to their people. The Sword of Shadows allowed them to sneak into the lairs of fearsome beasts, vanquishing them before they could wreak further havoc on innocent lives. The leprechauns became known across the land as heroes, and their legend spread far and wide. There was no shortage of stories telling of their brave deeds and the powerful swords that aided them in their battles. The Aelf, who had granted them these mighty gifts, watched from afar as the two leprechauns continued to grow and evolve. Though he felt a deep sense of pride in their accomplishments, he couldn't shake the lingering worry that the power of the swords might eventually become too alluring, and that his warning about wielding them responsibly would fade from their memories. The Aelf vowed to keep a watchful eye on the two heroes, ensuring that the lessons he had imparted to them would not be forgotten. And so, the tale of Paddy and Seamus, the two leprechaun heroes and their enchanted swords, continued. Their adventures took them to new heights, their hearts filled with courage, determination, and an unyielding sense of responsibility. Guided by the wisdom and powers granted to them by the Aelf, they set out to create a world where darkness and evil would never prevail. With each battle and victory, the legend of Paddy and Seamus lived on, inspiring generations to come and immortalizing their place in the annals of history. And through them, the true power of the enchanted swords and the Aelf's teachings would echo throughout time, a lasting reminder of the importance of honor, selflessness, and the incredible potential for good within us all."},{"instruction":"Transport charity Sustrans will buy a bike, helmet and lights for 50 unemployed people in a scheme thought to be the first of its kind in the UK.

Here is a hypothesis: It's more of a crime that the cards are false. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is possible to argue that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis can be considered true as well, but it is crucial to understand the connection between the two statements and analyze the reasoning behind this conclusion. The premise states that the real issue with prepackaged cards is not that they are prepackaged, but that they are false—in other words, they lack genuine emotion and act as a facade of personal connection. This premise also makes an analogy with corporate gift-giving, where the intention is to establish a bond, but the interaction is primarily driven by obligation or self-interest. Moving onto the hypothesis, it claims that it's more of a crime for the cards to be false than for them to be prepackaged. This hypothesis takes the essence of the premise and refines it into a comparative statement. It emphasizes the falsity of the cards as being a greater problem than the fact that they are prepackaged. Now, to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, we need to understand the implications of accepting this premise as true. Accepting the premise means we agree that the impersonal nature of prepackaged cards and their resemblance to insincere corporate gift-giving are problematic. This acceptance provides support for the hypothesis because, by identifying the falsehood of the cards as the core issue, it implicitly prioritizes this over the mere fact of being prepackaged. However, as an AI, I would also like to highlight that truth and falsity are complex concepts, and sometimes they can be subjective. While it appears that the premise supports the hypothesis, it doesn't mean that this is the absolute truth. Different people may have varying opinions on the significance of the falsity of the cards or the importance of genuine sentiments in gift-giving. Therefore, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis remains a matter of interpretation, and the conclusion that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, should be taken as a plausible reasoning within the context of these statements rather than an unquestionable fact."},{"instruction":"Southeast European Times için Üsküp'ten Marina Stojanovska'nın haberi -- 19/08/05 Which language is this?","output":"This language is Turkish.

In this book, Stevenson records not just the experience and the scenic beauty he encounters during his journey but also the daily trials and triumphs he faces, with a particular emphasis on his relationship with his donkey companion, Modestine. Modestine was a small and stubborn female donkey whom Stevenson bought at the beginning of his trip to carry his belongings.

As the two characters spend more time together, a bond begins to form between them, and their relationship evolves. As a literary figure, Modestine has her own distinct personality and becomes an important part of Stevenson's story. The interactions between Stevenson and Modestine provide insightful and amusing anecdotes, which showcase Stevenson's perseverance, patience, and understanding of the donkey's mindset.

Which language is this?","output":"This text is in German. The sentence \\"Vor allem ist er ein praktisch veranlagter Mann\\" translates to \\"Above all, he is a practically inclined man\\" in English. German is a West Germanic language predominantly spoken in Central Europe, particularly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and parts of Belgium. It is one of the world's major languages and is closely related to other Germanic languages such as Dutch, English, and Swedish. The German language has several dialects, with the most well-known being High German (Hochdeutsch) and Low German (Niederdeutsch). German uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters: ä, ö, ü, and ß. The language is known for its complex grammar rules, particularly in regards to noun cases and verb conjugations. Grammar in German includes four cases for nouns: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. Each case is used to express a specific grammatical relationship between the noun and the other parts of the sentence. Furthermore, there are three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and four noun types (der, die, das, and plurals), making proper usage of articles and adjective endings essential for grammatical accuracy. German verbs are also conjugated according to tense (present, preterite, perfect, pluperfect, future, and future perfect) and mood (indicative, subjunctive, and imperative). Regular verbs follow specific conjugation patterns while irregular verbs have their own unique forms. Additionally, there are numerous rules and exceptions to consider when constructing passive voice sentences, making proper use of modal verbs, and forming compound verbs. Despite its complexities, German is a rewarding language to learn due to its rich literary tradition, its influence on science and technology, and the cultural opportunities it presents. Additionally, proficiency in the German language is beneficial for business and trade, as Germany is one of the world's largest economies."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Here are possible answers to this question: - ticket booth - at hotel - shop - bookstore - post office I believe the correct choice is \\"post office\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"Post office, and here's a detailed explanation as to why this is the correct choice among the given options: 1. Ticket Booth: A ticket booth is a place where one typically purchases entrance to various events or services, such as movies, concerts, or public transport. In these transactions, money is the primary form of exchange between the customer and the clerk. Although they may receive tickets or tokens in return, these are usually printed or dispensed on demand after payment has been made. 2. Hotel: Hotels are businesses that provide lodging accommodations to tourists and travelers. When checking in or out at a hotel, the exchange tends to involve only money. Although some hotels may offer reward or voucher systems that can be used in place of cash, the primary transaction remains focused on payment for lodging and services provided. 3. Shop: When you enter a shop, the typical purpose is to find and purchase goods. The transaction between a customer and a clerk in a shop would generally consist of the customer presenting the good(s), and the clerk accepting money in return. There may be some instances where a reward or membership program allows for the use of store credit or points, but the central aspect still involves money being exchanged. 4. Bookstore: A bookstore is a shop specializing in books, and thus, follows the same principles as mentioned above. The transaction is primarily focused on the exchange of money for goods, with alternatives like store credits and rewards programs being secondary. Most bookstores function as a retail business, with money as the main method of payment. 5. Post Office: Post offices provide services such as mail delivery, package sending, and various other shipping-related tasks. When visiting the post office, customers often need to pay for services, such as shipping fees or the cost of postage. However, in certain situations, customers might hand over non-monetary items to the clerk. For instance, a customer might present a shipping label, returning pre-paid postage items, or submitting necessary documentation for a government-related service. The nature of the interactions in a post office differs from the other options listed, as transactions can frequently involve non-monetary exchanges. Comparing the five possible answers, \\"post office\\" is the correct choice as it is the most common place where a clerk may receive something other than money from a customer. This occurs regularly due to the specific services post offices provide, contrasting with the other options that focus primarily on monetary transactions for the exchange of goods or services."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Ulucanlar Prison Museum\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Firstly, the words \\"engaging\\" and \\"intimate\\" have inherently positive connotations. To label something as \\"engaging\\" implies that it is interesting, dynamic, and capturing the attention of its audience. This is a desirable quality for any feature, especially a first one, as it indicates that the creators have effectively managed to involve the audience in the content. Similarly, the term \\"intimate\\" suggests closeness and a personal connection, which is generally seen as a positive attribute. In the context of a first feature, it implies that the creators have invested significant emotional depth and personal resonances into the work, likely leading to a deeper, more meaningful experience for the audience. This in turn can evoke empathy and identification, ultimately resulting in a more satisfying engagement with the feature. Moreover, the fact that this is described as someone's \\"first feature\\" implies that these positive qualities are especially commendable considering it is their initial work. This insinuates potential for further growth and development in the creators' future projects. Additionally, the tone and syntax of the sentence further underline the positivity of this sentiment. The phrasing is concise and confident, effectively communicating the sense of admiration and enthusiasm towards the first feature in question. By positioning the adjectives \\"engaging\\" and \\"intimate\\" alongside one another, the sentence emphasizes that these qualities come together harmoniously, contributing further to the overall sense of positivity in this assessment. Thus, considering the combination of the positive connotations of the words \\"engaging\\" and \\"intimate,\\" along with the succinct and complimentary phrasing of the sentence, the sentiment here is clearly meant to be perceived as positive."},{"instruction":"Objective: Heal a sunburn. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choose from: a). Rub with butter. b). Rub with coconut oil.","output":"b). Rub with coconut oil. Naive physics reasoning is a simplistic and intuitive understanding of how things work in the environment, often based on everyday experiences. Using naive physics reasoning, we can determine that using coconut oil is the better option for healing a sunburn. In this case, rubbing the sunburned area with butter would not be an effective solution, as butter is a dairy product that may clog pores and can even worsen the irritation. Additionally, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that butter is beneficial to sunburns. On the other hand, coconut oil has soothing and moisturizing properties that can help alleviate sunburn-related irritation and dryness. It is also a natural emollient, meaning it helps to lock in moisture, which can promote the healing process. However, it's important to note that while coconut oil can provide temporary relief from sunburn symptoms, it should not replace proper sunburn care such as using aloe vera or over-the-counter medicated sunburn creams and staying hydrated.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

It is a Mexican holiday that honors and pays tribute to deceased loved ones and ancestors. The celebrations usually span from October 31st to November 2nd, coinciding with the Christian observances of All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. Although it is predominantly a Mexican tradition, Día de los Muertos has been embraced by various other cultures and observed in regions influenced by Mexican heritage. Such regions include countries in Central America as well as communities of Mexican descent in the United States, Canada, and other places around the globe. The origins of the Day of the Dead can be traced back to ancient Mesoamerican cultures, particularly the Aztecs, who held a month-long festival for their goddess Mictecacihuatl, the Queen of the Underworld. After the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, the practices and beliefs of this Indigenous festivity were merged with Catholic customs, resulting in the modern-day Día de los Muertos observances. During the celebrations, families and friends gather to remember and honor their deceased loved ones. They create elaborate altars, known as \\"ofrendas,\\" within their homes or at gravesites, decorated with marigold flowers, candles, photographs, incense, and offerings of food, drink, and personal items that hold significance to the departed souls. The belief is that these offerings help guide and support the spirits during their annual journey from the afterlife to the world of the living. Additionally, festive parades known as \\"calaveras\\" (skulls) or \\"catrinas\\" (elegantly dressed skeletons) take place in various cities and towns throughout Mexico, with participants dressed in vibrant and theatrical costumes, embodying the joyful nature of the holiday. Colorful skull-shaped candies and sugar skulls are popular treats shared and exchanged during the festivities, along with other traditional foods like pan de muerto (bread of the dead), a special kind of sweet bread made especially for this occasion. In summary, Día de los Muertos takes place primarily in Mexico, but its captivating and meaningful customs have been embraced and adopted by various cultures and communities around the world. The holiday serves as a powerful reminder that death is a natural part of the human experience, and that honoring and remembering loved ones should be a joyous and life-affirming occasion."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: H ome Every baby superstore features a section that could be called the Wall of Death.

While shopping at the department store and looking for fragrances, Alexandria decided on the vanilla but not the peppermint because the -vanilla was suited to her.; -peppermint was suited to her.;","output":"As Alexandria continued browsing through the vast range of fragrances, she couldn't help but be drawn to the delicate and alluring scent of the vanilla. Holding the bottle in her hand, she remembered how, as a child, she had always loved the rich, warm aroma that filled their home whenever her mother baked cookies. The vanilla had a certain familiarity and comfort that brought her back to those cherished moments in the past. While examining the perfume counter, her eyes were suddenly drawn to another scent in a beautifully designed bottle. The label read \\"Peppermint Wonderland\\". Intrigued, Alexandria decided to give it a try and sprayed some of the fragrance on her wrist. She had always loved minty scents, and the peppermint fragrance certainly had an invigorating effect. As she inhaled the refreshing and crisp aroma, she recalled the cozy winter nights spent curled up by the fireplace with a steaming mug of peppermint hot chocolate in her hands. Yet, despite the sweet memories peppermint brought back, it was difficult for Alexandria to decide whether the scent was truly suited for her. She tried to envision herself wearing the peppermint fragrance in different situations: during an important business meeting, at a romantic dinner date, and even on a casual day out with her friends. Although the peppermint perfume would definitely make her feel energized and alert in certain situations, she couldn't help but feel that it was somewhat overpowering for other occasions. As Alexandria stood there, deep in thought, she was approached by a helpful sales assistant. The assistant could see the dilemma Alexandria was facing and gently encouraged her to take her time and try other fragrances before making a final decision. Taking her advice, Alexandria sampled other scents such as floral, spicy, and fruity perfumes, but none of them seemed to resonate with her as much as the vanilla did. There was something unique and special about the vanilla fragrance that she couldn't quite put into words. After much consideration, Alexandria finally decided that the vanilla scent was the one she would purchase. The subtle, warm, and inviting aroma that the perfume exuded perfectly suited her personality and managed to kindle a sense of nostalgia and happiness in her heart. The peppermint, as delightful and refreshing as it was, didn't quite feel like the right choice for her. Alexandria believed that scents should be an extension of one's persona, and the vanilla perfume seemed to encapsulate her essence much better than the peppermint fragrance. Alexandria smiled to herself, satisfied with her choice, as she made her way to the cashier. As she exited the department store, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement, eager to envelop herself with this newfound fragrance that seemed to effortlessly merge her past and present, creating the perfect harmony between her memories and her current self. Little did Alexandria know how dear this simple idea of wearing vanilla perfume would become to her and how it would pleasantly color her interactions with those around her, forming an indelible aroma that would forever be associated with her name."},{"instruction":"David Lee Marks (born August 22, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the American rock band The Beach Boys, with whom he recorded four studio albums, and of whom he was a member from 1962 until 1963, again from 1997 until 1999, and lastly in 2012. Following his initial departure from the band, Marks fronted the Marksmen and performed and recorded as a session musician. A neighbor of the Wilson family - Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson - and a frequent participant at the Wilson family's Sunday night singalongs, Marks officially joined the Beach Boys in February 1962 as its rhythm guitarist. At age seven, David Lee Marks moved into a house across the street from the family home of the three Wilson brothers, Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, later to become the founding members of The Beach Boys. Describing the neighborhood, Marks noted, \\"It was run down. There were no sidewalks. The houses were older and the Wilsons lived in a pretty small, modest two-bedroom home. The boys all shared a bedroom. When they got older, Brian started sleeping in the den more and more, which was a converted garage they had turned into a music room. They had a Hammond B-3 organ, an upright piano and a little hi-fi in there.\\" As the 1950s progressed Marks sang and played music with the Wilson family at their Sunday night singalongs. Inspired by a 1958 performance by guitarist John Maus (later of the 1960s Walker Brothers), Marks asked his parents to buy him a guitar, which they did on Christmas Eve, 1958. He began taking lessons from Maus, who had been a student of Ritchie Valens. In 1959, Marks and Brian Wilson's youngest brother Carl had begun to develop their own style of playing electric guitars. Brian realized that the combination of Carl and Marks' playing brought a rock guitar sound to his original compositions, and the two teenagers participated in Brian's first songwriting efforts that led to the band's 1963 hit single \\"Surfer Girl\\". Marks was not on the Beach Boys first recording, \\"Surfin'\\" for Candix Records on October 16, 1961; this roster included Al Jardine, a high school classmate of Brian Wilson's who had been singing and playing stand-up bass with the Wilson brothers and their cousin Mike Love.

Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What happens before the season of sacrifice?\\" is the celebration of Carnival, Fastelavn, Shrove Tuesday, or Maslenitsa. The term Carnival is used in areas with a large Catholic presence but has since ceased to be celebrated in the Philippines. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn. In regions with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations occur on Shrove Tuesday. Finally, in Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on November 11th, sometimes at precisely 11:11 a.m. This timing can be traced back to pre-Advent celebrations or the harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day."},{"instruction":"Office building is a room or set of rooms or a building where people work, usually sitting at desks.

If Anne is 80cm tall, what is the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister? Your thoughts:","output":"Let's calculate the height of Anne's sister first: Since Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister, we can set up the following equation: Anne's height = 2 * (Anne's sister's height) Given that Anne is 80cm tall, we can now solve for Anne's sister's height: 80 cm = 2 * (Anne's sister's height) To find Anne's sister's height, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Anne's sister's height = 80 cm / 2 Anne's sister's height = 40 cm Now, we need to calculate Bella's height: Since Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne, we can set up the following equation: Bella's height = 3 * (Anne's height) Given that Anne is 80cm tall, we can now solve for Bella's height: Bella's height = 3 * 80 cm Bella's height = 240 cm Finally, we can determine the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister: Height difference = Bella's height - Anne's sister's height Height difference = 240 cm - 40 cm Height difference = 200 cm So, the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is 200 cm."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Man: Honey.

To determine this value, we first have to understand the egg-laying process and rate for a typical hen. Chickens, or hens, are known to lay eggs at different rates depending on factors such as age, breed, and environment. However, a general rule of thumb is that a healthy, productive hen can lay an egg once every 25-27 hours. This estimate varies by breed, and the time between laying eggs can vary between 23 and 28 hours. To calculate how long it would take a hen to lay 19 dozen eggs, we need to know the total number of eggs involved. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 19 dozen eggs would be a total of 19 * 12 = 228 eggs. Now, assuming the typical hen lays one egg every 26 hours (the approximate midpoint between 25 to 27 hours), we multiply the number of eggs (228) by the time it takes to produce one egg (26 hours): 228 eggs * 26 hours per egg = 5,928 hours Dividing this figure by the number of hours in a day (24) will give us the number of days it takes for the hen to lay 19 dozen eggs: 5,928 hours / 24 hours per day = 246.17 days So, the answer as a numeric value would be approximately 246 days for a typical hen to lay 19 dozen eggs. It is important to note that this is an estimation based on general egg-laying rates and may vary depending on the individual hen's circumstances."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: In which year did John Logie Baird demonstrate television in Glasgow","output":"The year when John Logie Baird demonstrated television in Glasgow was 1925. John Logie Baird, a Scottish inventor, was an early pioneer of television technology and is widely recognized for his contributions to the development of the modern television system. Born on August 13, 1888, in Helensburgh, Scotland, Baird dedicated much of his life to the innovative field of television and its potential for transmitting images and information across significant distances. On March 25, 1925, Baird held the first public demonstration of a working television system at the London department store Selfridges. This event captured the public's imagination, and later that year, Baird decided to showcase his invention in his home country of Scotland. In September 1925, Baird demonstrated the television in Glasgow for the first time during a series of presentations at the Grand Hotel on George Square and then at the Berlitz School of Languages. These demonstrations cemented his reputation as a trailblazer in the realm of television technology. During these presentations, Baird showcased his mechanical television system, which utilized a spinning disk and photocells to transmit images over radio waves. The images transmitted during these early demonstrations were crude and low-resolution compared to the electronic television systems that would come later. However, Baird's work laid the groundwork for the rapid development of increasingly sophisticated television technologies throughout the 20th century. In the years following these demonstrations, Baird continued to refine and develop his television system. In 1926, he gave the first demonstration of a working television transmitting moving images with grayscale tones. By 1928, Baird had successfully demonstrated the first transatlantic television transmission between London and New York. Throughout his career, Baird made numerous contributions to the advancement of television technology, including developments in color television and 3D television. In summary, John Logie Baird demonstrated television in Glasgow for the first time in 1925, showcasing his groundbreaking work in the development of this revolutionary technology."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is critically wounded while traveling on a bus?

An opening in the food packaging or a tear in the plastic indicate that the food has been exposed to cold, outside air, and has a higher chance of being freezer burned. Remove the food from the packaging, and check the food for dry areas, areas of discoloration, and ice crystals. Food with any of these qualities, is highly likely to be freezer burned. The exact color of freezer burn discoloration varies depending on the food, but freezer burn tends to look white on poultry (chicken), grayish-brown on meat (steak), white on vegetables, and icy crystals formations on ice cream. Patches of wrinkling on meat or vegetables are also an indication that your food might be freezer burned. Smell the food and see if you can detect an unpleasant plastic-y and stale “freezer” odor. When fat from food comes in contact with air outside of its packaging and oxidizes, it creates the gross freezer flavor and smell we associate with freezer burn. Store bought food is usually labeled with a storage date. Check the label and determine if the food has been stored past this date. If your food is past the labeled date, and has ice crystals, your food is most likely freezer burned. Freezer burned food is not unsafe to eat. However, you can save a majority portion of the food you plan to eat by trimming off the freezer burned areas, and preparing and eating the rest of the food like normal. If the freezer burn is widespread, throwing out the food may be the best option. Even though the food is safe to eat, it will be flavorless, or have a strange flavor. Freezer burned ice cream, will have small ice crystals formations on the surface, which are perfectly fine to eat, though not very appetizing.

Is During the regency of Maria Cristina, Espartero ruled Spain for two years as its 18th Prime Minister from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, your answer correctly identifies Spain's 18th Prime Minister as Baldomero Espartero, who served from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response, consider the following answer: Baldomero Espartero, full name Joaquín Baldomero Fernández Espartero, was Spain's 18th Prime Minister. He served during the regency of Maria Cristina, from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. Espartero was a prominent military figure, known for his victories in the First Carlist War, a political and military conflict from 1833-1839 between Spanish liberals and conservatives. Espartero was born on 27 February 1793 in Granátula de Calatrava, situated in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain. He began his military career at age 15 when he joined the Spanish army during the Peninsular War (1808-1814) against Napoleonic France. After the First Carlist War, Espartero was hailed as a national hero, and in 1840, he was appointed as the 18th Prime Minister of Spain. In addition to holding the title of Prime Minister, Espartero also took on various political roles, such as the Regent of the Kingdom and, later in his career, the Duke of La Victoria. However, his tenure as Prime Minister was marked by internal unrest within the country, political and social changes that occurred during the early years of the liberal regime, and the resistance to his efforts to centralize power. Due to this turbulence, his time in office lasted only two years. In 1841, a series of uprisings led by fellow generals resulted in Espartero's removal from power and his subsequent exile to the United Kingdom. He returned to Spain in 1847 and served in various military and political roles for the remainder of his life. In summary, Spain's 18th Prime Minister was Baldomero Espartero, who served from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841 during the regency of Maria Cristina. A highly respected military figure, Espartero's time as Prime Minister was fraught with internal conflict, which ultimately led to his exile and the end of his term."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.

It’s difficult to remember now how slowly news of the abduction trickled out. In part it was because of how remote Chibok is—just under 600 miles of barely motorable roads to the Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. However, it still took, then president, Goodluck Jonathan, two weeks before he spoke about the abduction. It has been four years since the Chibok girls’ abduction and there is a very different administration running Nigeria under president Muhammadu Buhari, but the mistakes that were made then are playing out almost exactly the same way with the recent Dapchi girls’ abduction. Armed fighters, believed to be Boko Haram militants, showed up with trucks in the small town in the northeastern state of Yobe, on Monday (Feb. 19), and specifically asked residents for directions to the local school which they attacked soon after and kidnapped scores of female students. It’s the first known large-scale schoolgirl abduction since Chibok. Since the abduction, there have been conflicting reports on the numbers of girls taken by the terrorist group, ranging from 50 to as high as 105. Again, the lack of clarity is all too reminiscent of the confusion with the Chibok girls’ abduction. Back then, there were a number of avoidable errors: from claiming the location of the girls was known, and yet not carrying out any rescue operation to attempts to shift blame for the abduction to the Borno state governor who was a member of the opposition. It was this poor, uncoordinated response to the abduction that necessitated the creation of the pressure group, Bring Back Our Girls and the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls which went viral on social media world over, used by the former US first lady Michelle Obama and celebrities to put pressure on the Nigerian government to act promptly to rescue the girls. A sign for the Government Girls Science and Technology College is pictured in Dapchi (Reuters/Ola Lanre) This time, there has also been an announcement by the Yobe state government that the Nigerian military had rescued over 50 of the abducted schoolgirls but it offered next to no details on how this rescue operation took place. By the next day, the state governor had been forced to retract the statement, clarifying that there has been no rescue. There has also been the claim by the Nigerian minister of information, Lai Mohammed, that the terrorists carried out the attack to embarrass the Buhari-led administration—casting the president as the victim of the attack rather than the girls who were taken. President Buhari himself has yet to publicly address the Nigerian public save for updates from his official Twitter account, which is not the most effective way of reaching all Nigerians. I have directed the Military and Police to mobilize immediately to ensure that all the missing girls of Government Girls Secondary School, Dapchi, are found. The Minister of Defence will also lead a Federal Government delegation to Yobe tomorrow, to ascertain the situation. — Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) February 21, 2018 Even though the Jonathan and Buhari administrations are very different in many ways, the response to each attacks shows how Nigeria’s politicians can be insulated or out of touch with their public. But while the Jonathan’s government had the excuse of being caught off-guard by a first-of-its-kind crisis, Buhari’s team can’t claim the same. For example, despite the high profile fallout from the Chibok kidnapping and the relentless focus on young girls and women by Boko Haram, the Nigerian government has failed to properly secure secondary schools in the region and strengthen intelligence-gathering to forestall future attacks by Boko Haram. It is entirely possible the terrorist militants targeted the school in Dapchi in order to use them as leverage for extracting concessions from the government in the same way that they have done with the Chibok girls. (paywall) Never again? The Nigerian government needs to take a number of urgent steps to prevent the free-fall into confusion that this incident is becoming: First, it needs to learn to better manage information around the abduction by keeping the Nigerian public abreast of developments surrounding rescue efforts by sharing timely updates, rather than allowing others fill the vacuum. There should be clarity on which government official or agency speaks on the abduction in order to avoid a repeat of the mistake that led to the false news of rescued girls. The government should also quit attempts to stifle the media covering the story or preventing the parents of the missing girls from speaking to the press. The priority here should be the rescue of these girls and not the reputation of the government—the latter can only be redeemed by the achievement of the former. Secondly, the Nigerian government must ensure security agencies from the military, the police and the Department of State Security (DSS) make the rescue of the girls a number one priority and make use of all available resources. In the Chibok girls’ abduction saga, the time spent by government trying to put a response together was taken advantage of by the terrorists in getting out of the reach of the security agencies. This must not be allowed to repeat itself. Every second counts. Thirdly, president Buhari should avoid the mistake of his predecessor in refusing to immediately communicate first with the parents of the missing girls directly, and then with Nigerians. This is not the time for him to be holed up in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa and communicating via proxies. This is the time for him to show empathy and to lead from the front as he promised when he ran for election in 2015. The Nigerian Government must make a stronger commitment to not just containing Boko Haram but totally defeating them. It is evident that despite claims from the government two years ago that the terrorist organization had been ‘technically defeated’, they are still active with a spate of attacks in the North-East region. The Chibok girls’ abduction was a turning point in public perception for the previous administration and sounded the death knell for it at the 2015 elections. If the Buhari administration hopes to avoid this next year, it must ensure that it handles the Dapchi girls’ abduction better. It is not too late for it to take corrective measures.

Officials have been careful to avoid acknowledging anyone was kidnapped in Dapchi. Instead, they say only that the girls are missing. Witnesses, however, described seeing the girls in militants’ vehicles as part of what appeared to be a deliberate plan to steal them. And they said militants arrived at the town looking specifically for the building, which is a boarding place with about 900 students. One resident who lives a mile outside Dapchi, who asked that his name not be used because he feared for his safety, said his neighbor was outside his home late in the day on Monday when militants pulled up, grabbed him and asked him to point them to the school. He told the fighters he didn’t know where it was and begged to be released. They threw him aside and headed toward the town. Other residents were also abducted by the militants and ordered to direct them to the school before being released, townspeople said. Fighters arrived at the school about 5:30 p.m., guns blazing. Hafsat Lawan, 15, said she and classmates heard gunshots in the distance. ||||| DAPCHI, Nigeria—Garba Sule was preparing for evening prayers when heavily armed Boko Haram jihadists rode into town last week in pickup trucks, firing hundreds of rounds into the air and demanding directions to the local girls’ school.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","output":"Of the two given sentences, Sentence A does not make sense. Let's break down each sentence to understand why: - Sentence A: \\"He put a television on her finger.\\" This sentence does not make sense because a television is a large electronic device used for watching or streaming audio-visual content, whereas a finger is a small appendage on a human hand. It is not logically or physically possible to place a television on someone's finger due to the difference in size, weight, and function. The objects and the context provided do not align in a coherent manner. - Sentence B: \\"He put a diamond ring on her finger.\\" This sentence makes sense because a diamond ring is a piece of jewelry, typically consisting of a metal band (usually made of gold, silver, or other precious metals) and adorned with a diamond or other gemstones. The ring is typically worn on a person's finger. Placing a diamond ring on someone's finger is a common gesture that often signifies a romantic proposal, engagement, or any form of commitment.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for this conclusion: 1. When people consume excessive alcohol, their motor and cognitive functions become impaired. This can include trouble with balance, coordination, judgment, and self-awareness. 2. With impaired motor skills, a drunk person may stumble, sway, or have trouble standing or walking. These actions can be perceived as ridiculous by others. 3. Cognitive impairments can lead to slurred speech, incoherent sentences, or inappropriate behavior, all of which can contribute to a perception of being ridiculous. 4. Often, people who are overly drunk may lose their inhibitions and engage in activities or conversations they normally wouldn't when sober. This unpredictability can make them appear ridiculous to onlookers. It's worth noting that the other options mentioned can also be valid observations when someone is overly drunk, such as getting disoriented, walking off unexpectedly, throwing up, or raising hell (acting unruly, causing disturbances).

A more detailed and long answer could be: Georgian architecture refers to a style of architecture that was popular in England and its colonies between 1714 and 1830, during the reigns of the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover—King George I, King George II, King George III, and King George IV. This architectural style was a significant part of the broader movement known as Neoclassicism, which was characterized by the use of proportion, symmetry, and classical Greek and Roman architectural elements. During this period, Georgian architecture was the primary architectural style in Britain and its colonies, where it was used in the construction of townhouses and country estates, as well as civic buildings and churches. Notable features of the style include the use of classical orders, decorative moldings, balanced and symmetrical facades, and orderly and well-proportioned interiors. The style was influenced by the works of prominent architects like Christopher Wren, Inigo Jones, and James Gibbs. In the late 19th century, the United States experienced a revival of Georgian architecture known as Colonial Revival architecture. It emerged as an expression of nostalgia for the country's colonial past, its British heritage, and a desire to recreate the elegance and simplicity of Georgian design. In Great Britain, a similar revival occurred in the early 20th century, referred to as Neo-Georgian architecture. Both revivals can also be called Georgian Revival architecture. Colonial Revival and Neo-Georgian architecture retained many traditional Georgian elements, such as symmetry, balance, and the use of classical orders and details. However, they also introduced some modern aspects and adapted the Georgian style to suit the changing needs, preferences, and technological advancements of the period. This revival continued until the mid-20th century, and the influence of Georgian architecture can still be seen in contemporary design across the United States and the United Kingdom. In conclusion, Georgian architecture was in style between 1714 and 1830, during the reign of the British monarchs from the House of Hanover. The style was later revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture.

Storefronts and street vendors line this busy thoroughfare, making it a popular spot for shopping and dining, in addition to its stunning views of the Edinburgh Castle. Amidst the usual hustle and bustle of the city life, the sight of Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner sprinting along Princes Street created quite a stir amongst the onlookers.

Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... What takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy? A. Avoiding one's feelings B. Keeping an exercise routine C. not enough information D.

The war, however, was not an indefinite period of struggle; it found its conclusion in the year 2011, marking an eight-year time span of tense combat. The conflict began with the United States-led invasion, an initiative grounded on the premise of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, ending Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and freeing the Iraqi people. This combative period evolved into an extensive military and political story, deeply inscribing itself into the history of Iraq.

Step 2: Combine the -16*m and -13*m. -16*m - 13*m = -29*m Now, the equation becomes: -59*m - 150 = -29*m Step 3: Move the -29*m term to the left side of the equation to isolate the m terms together. To do this, add 29*m to both sides of the equation: -59*m + 29*m - 150 = -29*m + 29*m This simplifies to: -30*m - 150 = 0 Step 4: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation to isolate the m term on the left side.

In other words, it is expected that if all hypotheses are true, strong evidence should be found to confirm 8 of them distinctly. Now, let's analyze the provided options to determine which one best fits the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true.\\" [1]. yes: This option suggests that the premise supports the hypothesis. Indeed, there is a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis. Based on the premise, if all 78 hypotheses are true, then 8 of them should have overwhelming confirmation. The hypothesis that \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true\\" builds upon the premise by suggesting that these 8 hypotheses should be easy to confirm within the context of the scenario presented. Therefore, option [1], \\"yes,\\" seems to establish a connection between the two statements. [2]. it is not possible to tell: Choosing this option would imply that there is not enough information to determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. However, as discussed above, there is a clear correlation between both statements indicating that 8 of the hypotheses should be confirmed with strong evidence if all 78 are true. Thus, option [2] does not appear to be the best answer. [3]. no: This option would imply that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. However, as previously discussed, there is a connection between the two statements in terms of the expectation for 8 of the hypotheses to be confirmed with substantial evidence in the case that all 78 are true. Consequently, option [3] contradicts the relationship identified between the premise and the hypothesis. Taking into account the analysis of each option, the best answer to what the premise tells us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true\\" is [1], \\"yes.\\" The premise does support the idea that 8 hypotheses should have overwhelming confirmation and, thus, be more straightforward to confirm if all the 78 hypotheses are true."},{"instruction":"What the TwoPack does is to embed in the EU legal framework the working practices established under these intergovernmental instruments Add punctuation.","output":"The TwoPack refers to two European Union (EU) regulations that were adopted in 2013 to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area.

What the TwoPack does is to embed in the EU legal framework the working practices established under these intergovernmental instruments. These working practices involve effective monitoring and surveillance of fiscal policies, early detection of potential economic imbalances, and taking necessary corrective measures, when required. By transferring these practices to the EU legal framework, the TwoPack ensures that member states follow a more coherent approach in addressing macroeconomic challenges. This allows the European Commission and other EU bodies to carry out an improved oversight of national budgets and economic policies, which ultimately results in a more resilient and stable euro area.

Much of this came in understanding the context of the sentence. Step 2: The first added comma comes after 'happened that', to separate the main idea of the 'miracle' described and the specifics of this which follow. Step 3: 'In only eight days' is referring to a finite period, while 'the period indicated...' is further explaining this period. Hence, I have used a hyphen to separate these interchanging ideas at the beginning and end of the insert for clarity. Step 4: It is common to use a comma before and after a title when it appears in the middle of a sentence. Hence, there is a period after 'Mr' in 'Mr. Milyukov' to indicate the abbreviation. Step 5: Next, the sentence mentions 'to all Russia's representatives abroad', which could be misunderstood without a possessive marker. So, an apostrophe has been added to indicate that the representatives belong to Russia, i.e., 'Russia's representatives'. Step 6: There's another part of the sentence from 'a monarchy collapsed that' to 'had managed to maintain itself'. A comma was added after ‘collapsed that’ to separate the idea of the collapse of the monarchy from the details of its longevity. Step 7: Lastly, a hyphen is added in '1905-07' to denote the span of years.

There are over 20 miles (32 km) of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are encouraged to wear proper footgear and to be prepared for icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, \\"If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing\\". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands. Loyalsock Trail, often abbreviated LT, is a rugged 59.28-mile (95.40 km) hiking trail that stretches from near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow \\"LT\\". Recently, the trail markers have been changed to a yellow disc with a red \\"LT\\". Link Trail is a moderate 8.5-mile (13.7 km) trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the 55.33-mile (89.05 km) post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a 17.62 miles (28.36 km) long loop. Canyon Vista Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, sugar maple, and black cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista...

Fact 2: All parasites are harmful to their host, but some are beneficial to humans. Given the two facts above, some what are beneficial to humans? Pick from: A). fungi. B). parasites. C). roots. D). humans suffering. E). natural disasters. F). honeybees. G). poisons. H). orchids. Answer:","output":"B). parasites. Given the facts provided, the correct answer would be B). parasites, as it's stated in the facts that \\"all parasites are harmful to their host, but some are beneficial to humans\\". This implies that while parasites are generally harmful and often cause harm or disease to their hosts, there are certain situations in which they can offer benefits to humans. To clarify, the word parasite usually brings to mind harmful organisms like ticks or tapeworms, which can cause serious health issues in both humans and animals. However, some parasites have been known to provide certain benefits to humans, often in the realm of medical treatment and research. For example, the bacteria Heliobacter pylori is technically a parasite because it lives in human stomachs, often causing peptic ulcers and sometimes leading to stomach cancer. However, it provides a human benefit as well because it regulates stomach acidity and can help prevent other diseases of the gut. Another well-known example is leeches, which were historically used (and in some cases are still used today) to remove localized excess blood due to their natural blood-sucking abilities. Likewise, the Guinea worm, another parasite, is used to inform health initiatives in rural and underprivileged areas, as infections act as an indicator of a community's access to clean water. In scientific research, parasites are used to better understand biological processes, disease mechanisms, and host-pathogen interactions, all of which can offer insights into human health. Thus, while parasites are traditionally associated with negativity and harm, they can play a beneficial role in certain contexts, particularly within the field of medicine and scientific research, making them a plausible answer to the question based on the presented information. Answer A). fungi, is not explicitly supported by the provided facts. While many fungi do have parasitic characteristics and some may even be beneficial to humans, the facts do not specifically refer to fungi. The same reasoning applies to C). roots, D). humans suffering, E). natural disasters, F). honeybees, G). poisons, and H). orchids.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"Euthydemus was possibly a satrap before he overthrew Diodotus II and started his own dynasty in the Greco-Bactrian kingdom around 230 BCE.

The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter. Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty gardener, Angelique who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis, in this case, the dissolving of iron, can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of rust formation. To better explain this, let's analyze the steps involved in the rust formation process, and how the dissolving of iron will impact them. 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When the iron surface comes into contact with water, the process initiates. The presence of moisture is essential for rust formation. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: Water, when exposed to air, reacts with carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. This acidic medium accelerates the chemical reactions that take place on the iron surface, which eventually leads to rust formation. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The presence of acid increases the solubility of iron in water, causing iron ions to dissolve. With the perturbation hypothesis in place, we assume that more iron will dissolve in this stage. This increased dissolution of iron ions accelerates the overall rust formation process. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: The water molecules involved in these chemical reactions can break down into hydrogen and oxygen elements. The available oxygen acts as an oxidizing agent, further fueling the rust formation process. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: An important stage in rust formation is when the free oxygen in the mixture reacts with the dissolved iron ions to form iron oxide. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that more iron is getting dissolved, which would inevitably lead to a larger amount of iron oxide being produced. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust: The iron oxide produced is what we commonly refer to as rust. Given that the dissolving of iron is increased in the perturbation hypothesis, more rust will be formed at a faster rate. In conclusion, the dissolving of iron in this perturbation hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the rust formation process. Directly, it leads to increased availability of iron ions for reactions with free oxygen, resulting in more iron oxide (rust) being produced. Indirectly, this increased dissolution can accelerate the chemical reactions occurring on the iron surface, enhancing the overall process of rust formation. Therefore, the supposed perturbation does have a significant effect on the rust formation process, leading to more rust being formed at an accelerated rate."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: It will pay 22.5m euros for a full share in the hotel.","output":"The sentence to be translated from English to Turkish is: \\"It will pay 22.5m euros for a full share in the hotel.\\" Step 1: Identify the main parts of the sentence.

Given the context: Why did Kai do this? Possible answers: give up and hide, make people understand, start a petition for more support A:","output":"Kai petitioned the committee for redress when his protest fell on deaf ears because he wanted to make people understand his concerns and gather more support for his cause. By taking this course of action, Kai demonstrated his determination to resolve the issue and his unwillingness to give up on his beliefs. There are several reasons why Kai chose to petition the committee after his initial protest seemingly failed to achieve the desired outcome: 1. Persistence in the face of adversity: It is evident that Kai is passionate about the issue at hand and is willing to pursue various avenues to convey his message and achieve his objectives. Petitioning the committee is another means by which he can ensure that his voice is heard by those in power who have the ability to address his concerns. 2. Rallying support: By starting a petition, Kai can garner more attention to his cause and persuade others to join him in his efforts. In the process, he can build a stronger case and demonstrate to the committee that a significant number of people are concerned about the issue and support his call for redress. 3. Amplifying his message: A successful petition can not only help Kai garner support but also amplify his message. As more people sign the petition, others may become curious about the issue, leading to increased awareness and potentially encouraging further discussion and debate on the subject. This increased visibility and attention can exert pressure on the committee to seriously consider Kai's request and address the issue in question. 4. Demonstrating commitment: By continuing to fight for his cause even after his initial protest failed to yield the desired results, Kai is sending a powerful message to the committee and others about his unwavering commitment to the issue. This determination may make it more difficult for the committee to dismiss his concerns outright. It also establishes Kai as a dedicated advocate, making it more likely that others will take his message seriously and offer their support. In summary, Kai's decision to petition the committee for redress when his protest fell on deaf ears highlights his dedication to and perseverance in pursuing his cause. By rallying support and amplifying his message through the petition, Kai aims to make people understand the importance of the issue and encourage them to join his efforts. Moreover, his persistent actions both demonstrate his commitment to the cause and put pressure on the committee to take notice and address the concerns raised in his petition."},{"instruction":"First question: Do mermaids and vampires exist? Second question: Do mermaids really exist? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let us address each question individually. First question: Do mermaids and vampires exist? Mermaids and vampires are mythical creatures that have been a part of various cultures, legends, and folklore around the world for centuries. Mermaids are half-human, half-fish mythical creatures usually depicted with the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish. They have been present in various mythologies, including Greek, Roman, and even some African and Asian cultures. Evidence for their existence is primarily in the form of stories and folklore, but no verifiable scientific evidence has been found to confirm their existence. Vampires are supernatural beings believed to feed on the life essence (usually in the form of blood) of living creatures. The concept of vampires has existed in various forms across different cultures and continents, from ancient Babylon and Greece to Africa and the Americas. Like mermaids, vampires are also legendary creatures with their existence primarily supported through stories, myths, and folklore. Science has yet to provide any verifiable evidence for their existence. Second question: Do mermaids really exist? As mentioned in the answer to the first question, mermaids are mythical creatures that have appeared in various cultures and folklore. While many stories and legends portray mermaids as enchanting, magical beings, there is no scientific evidence to support their existence. Numerous attempts have been made to understand and explain mermaid sightings as misinterpretations of natural phenomena or mistaken identity with known aquatic animals, such as manatees or sea lions. In summary, the current body of scientific knowledge and evidence does not support the existence of mermaids. Now, addressing the final inquiry: Are these two questions asking the same thing? While the two questions may appear similar, they are not exactly the same. The first question asks about the existence of two separate mythical creatures—mermaids and vampires. The answer to this question involves exploring both creatures, their origins, and the evidence that supports or opposes their existence. On the other hand, the second question focuses solely on the existence of mermaids and does not include vampires. The answer to the second question requires a specific examination of mermaids and their role in folklore and myth, as well as evaluating the available scientific evidence. In conclusion, the two questions are indeed related, as they both concern the existence of mythical creatures. However, they are not identical, as the first question encompasses the existence of both mermaids and vampires, while the second question is exclusively concerned with the existence of mermaids."},{"instruction":"Use reasoning to answer the following question.

This is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. It's from The Usual Suspects of course in relation to Kaiser Gold..I mean Sose.. I got another one like that: -The dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline- This movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making I have seen in a long time. It starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. But alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. And it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts. Pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain I would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. And they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming. And that's all jolly swell. But at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like \\"Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle.

I'll also consider grammatical structures and cultural references if any. Here is how I can translate the sentence: \\"Starý muž by pravděpodobně zemřel během týdnů, pokud ne dnů.\\" Why? Czech grammar structure is slightly different than English and word-for-word translation could result in loss of original meaning. Here \\"starý muž\\" means \\"the old man\\", \\"by pravděpodobně zemřel\\" refers to \\"would probably be dead\\", \\"během týdnů\\" is \\"within weeks\\", \\"pokud ne\\" is \\"if not\\" and lastly \\"dnů\\" is \\"days\\".

Movie title: The War of the Roses Movie plot: Lawyer Gavin D'Amato is in his office discussing a divorce case with a client. Noticing the man's determination to divorce his wife, Gavin decides to tell him the story of one of his clients, a personal friend of his. Oliver Rose, a student at Harvard Law School, meets Barbara at an auction, where they bid on the same antique. Oliver chats Barbara up and they become friends. When Barbara misses her ferry home, the two end up spending the night together at a local hotel. Eventually the two marry and have two children, Josh and Carolyn. Over the years, the Roses grow richer, and Barbara finds an old mansion whose owner has recently died, purchases it and devotes her time to making a home there. However, cracks seem to be forming in the family. As Oliver becomes a successful partner in his law firm, Barbara, who was a doting and loving wife early in the marriage, appears to grow restless in her life with Oliver, and begins to dislike him immensely. Oliver, for his part, cannot understand what he has done to earn Barbara's contempt, despite his controlling, self-centered, and generally dismissive behavior toward her. When Oliver believes he is suffering a heart attack, (actually a hiatal hernia) the day after an argument, Barbara (after her initial shock and concern) realizes she felt a sense of relief that he might be dead. She tells him so, adding that she no longer loves him and wants a divorce and Oliver accepts. Feeling that it might not be wise to represent himself, Oliver hires Gavin as his legal counsel on a retainer. Tension arises between Oliver and Barbara during negotiations when it becomes clear that she wants the house and everything in it. When Barbara's lawyer uses Oliver's final love note to her (which he had written in the hospital) as leverage against him in their legal battle, she refuses to back down. Barbara initially throws Oliver out of the house, but he moves back in after discovering a loophole in the divorce that allows him to stay. As a result, Barbara immediately begins plotting to... The answer is:","output":"In the movie \\"The War of the Roses,\\" Barbara tries to drop a heavy chandelier on Oliver's head. This action demonstrates the extent of the hostility between the couple and the lengths to which they are willing to go in their fight against each other. The plot revolves around the disintegration of the Roses' marriage and their increasingly bitter feud as they fight for control over their possessions, particularly the house. As Oliver and Barbara's conflict escalates, their actions become more drastic and dangerous, culminating in Barbara's attempt to injure or possibly kill Oliver by dropping the chandelier on him. This scene not only underscores the animosity between the characters but also serves as a symbol of the destructive nature of their relationship and their refusal to compromise. The chandelier, a valuable and elegant object, represents the wealth and material success they have built together; however, it ultimately becomes a weapon used to bring about their undoing. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, consider the film's exploration of the dark side of marriage, the lengths people might go in the struggle for control, and the consequences of prioritizing material possessions over personal relationships. The War of the Roses has the potential to be a captivating, thought-provoking, and emotionally charged drama that delves into the intricacies of human relationships and the destructive power of bitterness and resentment."},{"instruction":"Dieser Song ist eine richtige Speedgranate mit abwechslungsreichem Aufbau und hymnischem Chorus.

The iconic character, played by Kirkbride since 1972, was a staple of the Manchester-based ITV soap, leaving behind a legacy of unforgettable storylines and memorable moments that cemented her as an integral part of the series. Early Life and Career Born on June 21, 1954, in Oldham, Lancashire, Anne Kirkbride began her acting career with parts in various stage plays and television shows. Her first appearance on Coronation Street was in 1972, in the role of the shy and introverted teenager, Deirdre Hunt. Initially intended as a one-time guest role, Deirdre quickly became a fan favorite and found her way into many of the soap's plotlines. Her character was gradually developed, evolving to become the complex and spirited Deirdre Barlow that viewers loved. Kirkbride portrayed her for more than 40 years, making her the eighth-longest-serving actor in the history of the show. Notable Storylines and Moments Over the years, Deirdre Barlow charmed viewers with a mixture of heartwarming and heart-wrenching storylines showcasing love, loss, and everything in between. Some of her most significant moments in Coronation Street included: - Her marriage to Ken Barlow (played by William Roache) in 1981, which was watched by more than 24 million viewers, surpassing the TV audience for Prince Charles and Lady Diana's wedding. - The \\"Free the Weatherfield One\\" storyline of 1998, where Deirdre was wrongfully imprisoned for a crime she did not commit, spurring nationwide support for her release. - Her numerous relationships and heartbreaks, including divorces, betrayals, and sometimes a glimmer of hope for a happier future. - Her unwavering loyalty to her family, particularly her daughter Tracy (played by Kate Ford), despite her turbulent relationship and challenges they faced together. Anne Kirkbride's Death and Character's Departure Sadly, Anne Kirkbride passed away on January 19, 2015, at the age of 60, following her battle with breast cancer. Her death came as a shock to her friends, family, and her Coronation Street colleagues, who all mourned her loss and respected the decision to write Deirdre Barlow out of the series. The show's producers chose to mirror the real-life approach of Kirkbride's passing, with the character's family receiving the news that Deirdre Barlow had died off-screen during an episode broadcasted on July 8, 2015. The Heartfelt Response Fans and colleagues alike joined together in mourning and celebrating her life and contributions to Coronation Street and British television. Celebrities such as Philip Schofield and Piers Morgan expressed their condolences, tweeting about the loss of a legend and the impact she had on both the show and its viewers.

The few paying jobs he had during his lifetime included mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and American Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - A mountain man is a male trapper and explorer who lives in the wilderness. Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various Emigrant Trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the mule train based inland fur trade. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of... - Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) for the express purpose of causing immediate death. The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broad sense to euthanasia and suicide. It first renders the person unconscious, and then stops the breathing and heart, in that order. - Lawrence Colwell , Jr. , aka Charles Durrant , a 35 - year - old white male , was voluntarily executed by lethal injection at the Nevada State Prison in Carson City , Nevada on March 26 , 2004 .

He was the 905th execution in US since 1976 . - Carson City, officially the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, is an independent city and the capital of the US state of Nevada, named after the mountain man Kit Carson. As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274. The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about south of Reno. The town originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City.

Last September, Cynthia de la Vega was first runner up for Nuestra Belleza Mexico, a position that normally goes on to compete in Miss World. (The contest's winner competes in Miss Universe.) A slightly more curvaceous de la Vega held a press conference last week claiming she was a victim of overzealous pageant organizers, who booted her for going a little heavy on the food and gaining a few pounds. On Tuesday, she appeared on Good Morning America saying she was “sad and very deceived.” “I cried and cried and cried,” she told the show. The 19-year-old said all she wants is to represent her country. The pageant’s move disqualifies her from being a contender of the Miss World contest, which is in November. But pageant officials say her removal had nothing to do with a chunkier de la Vega. Instead, they said, her title was stripped because she showed a lack of discipline and failed to meeting the ceremonial obligations of a well-behaved beauty queen. “The training of a beauty queen is equivalent to the training of an athlete – there is no cutting corners on sleep, a zero tolerance for alcohol, and long hours of preparation,” Lupita Jones, Mexico’s first Miss Universe winner, who now heads Nuestra Belleza. Keeping de la Vega “was a risk we couldn’t take,” Jones said. De la Vega denies not fulfilling her obligations, and told Telediario’s \\"Tras los Famosos\\" television show that Jones portrayal of her was “not who I am.” If de la Vega is right, it wouldn’t be the first time a beauty queen has lost her title over some extra calories. Earlier this year, 17-year-old Domonique Ramírez, who won Miss San Antonio, caused a stir when she was allegedly told by pageant officials to “get off the tacos.” She was stripped of her title for supposed conduct unbecoming of a beauty queen, but she later sued and won her crown back. Although the verdict made the size two Ramírez eligible to run for Miss Texas, she declined to do so.

However, fearing that Uffizi has been tainted by Dracula, Cardinal Siqueros (Roy Scheider) refuses to give Uffizi his blessing for the mission. Uffizi defrocks himself and sets out with Luke to Bucharest. Romania has been devastated by a civil war, and NATO peacekeepers line the streets. In an abandoned village, Uffizi and Luke find a crashed helicopter containing a news reporter, Julia (Alexandra Wescourt), and her cameraman. The cameraman is turned by the vampire clowns terrorising the village, but all are destroyed by Uffizi and Luke. They leave Julia but are soon lured into a rebel trap. They find Julia with the rebels, refusing to return to England with nothing but a story on vampires. The undead attack the rebel base during the night, but Uffizi, Luke and Julia survive, proceeding to Dracula's castle. There they find Elizabeth, almost totally turned to Dracula's way of life. Dracula mortally wounds Julia and tells Uffizi that only through God's forgiveness can he truly die, but Uffizi engages the ancient vampire in a duel and ultimately destroys him by first biting him and draining him of his blood, then beheading him, announcing that he should consider himself forgiven. Meanwhile, Luke, on her request, beheads Elizabeth. Luke leaves the castle, while Uffizi sits on Dracula's throne, with Julia revived as a vampire. The film ends with the implication that Uffizi, who has missed the morning purge of his vampiric curse, has become the new vampire lord.

Options: a ) 1 , b ) 3 , c ) 0 , d ) 5 , e ) 7 Solution:","output":"Task: Answer the multiple-choice question on the general math about the units digit of the product of the first 100 odd numbers. Simple Steps: 1. Identify the first 100 odd numbers. 2. Find the units digit of the product of these numbers. 3. Match the answer with the given options. Guidelines: - Classify answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Solution: 1. The first 100 odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,...,197, 199. 2. To find the units digit of the product, we only need to focus on the units digit of each odd number. We know that the units digit of the multiplication of two numbers depends only on the units digits of each number. For example, when you multiply 6 * 53, the units digit of the answer, 318, depends only on 6 * 3 = 18. So, let's analyze the units digit of odd numbers: - Units digit of 1 is 1 - Units digit of 3 is 3 - Units digit of 5 is 5 - Units digit of 7 is 7 - Units digit of 9 is 9 Notice that all the odd numbers end with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. We need to find the units digit of the product of these numbers. We can group the numbers by their units digit: - There are 20 numbers with units digit 1 (1, 11, 21,...,191) - There are 20 numbers with units digit 3 (3, 13, 23,...,193) - There are 20 numbers with units digit 5 (5, 15, 25,...,195) - There are 20 numbers with units digit 7 (7, 17, 27,...,197) - There are 20 numbers with units digit 9 (9, 19, 29,...,199) Now let's multiply the units digits in each group: - 1*1*1...*1 = 1 (20 times) - 3*3*3...*3 = 3^20 - 5*5*5...*5 = 5^20 - 7*7*7...*7 = 7^20 - 9*9*9...*9 = 9^20 Next, multiply all the results: - 1 * (3^20) * (5^20) * (7^20) * (9^20) Finally, let's find the units digit of the product. Since we have a 5 in our product, the units digit of the product will be 0. Whenever we have a 5 and an even number in the factors, the units digit is always 0. In our case, it's the 5 and any of the other units digits (all the others are odd, but there is at least one even number in the product: 3*7=21, for example). 3. Match the answer with the given options: c) 0 So, the units digit of the product of the first 100 odd numbers is 0 (Option 'c')."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (; ) is an autonomous region in Northern Italy.

Mr. Bonestripper A:","output":"Title: The Bonestripper Chronicles Genre: Horror/Thriller Plot: The story begins in the small, sleepy town of Ravenwood, known for its mysterious legends, ghost stories, and its once-thriving amusement park, Thrill Manor. Thrill Manor has been closed for almost a decade due to a series of tragic accidents involving its main attraction: the infamous roller coaster, Mr. Bonestripper. For years, it has been rumored that the seemingly inanimate coaster is cursed, and no one dares to step foot in the abandoned park. A group of adventurous and curious friends, Sam, Lily, Jeff, and Sarah, have arrived to the town to create a documentary about the mysteries surrounding Mr. Bonestripper and the accidents that led to the park's closure. Sam is a skeptic, but the rest of the group believe in the supernatural and are determined to prove that there is more to the legend of the roller coaster than mere rumor. The town's mayor, Stephen Delaney, is against their investigation but reluctantly permits them to enter the old theme park, warning them to stay cautious. Inside the park, the group is initially fascinated by the eerie ambiance and begins exploring the various attractions. During their first night, they come across a hidden laboratory behind Mr. Bonestripper. Here, they learn about a reclusive scientist named Dr. Ivan Penrose, who had been working on a project involving merging human souls with machines. The friends study his journals and diaries, discovering that Dr. Penrose had been experimenting with merging pain receptors from human subjects into his creations, hoping to create the most thrilling yet dangerous roller coaster experience. As the plot thickens, Jeff and Sarah spend a night poring through paperwork in the lab while Sam and Lily explore the roller coaster tracks. Whilst traversing the twisted metal, they uncover hidden compartments containing the remains of the coaster's victims, tangled amidst the gears and machinery. The shocking discovery plunges the team into a frantic search for the truth about Dr. Penrose's experiments. As the friends delve deeper into the mystery, they start to experience strange occurrences and vivid nightmares that feel more like warning messages from beyond the grave. They discover that Dr. Penrose was actually in league with the sinister Mayor Delaney, who had been stealing corpses from local burial sites to sell to the mad doctor. Dr. Penrose used the human bones and organs in the machinery of Mr. Bonestripper, seeking to imbue the thrilling ride with the souls and pain receptors of the deceased. The ill-fated coaster now bears depraved memories of its unwilling victims, causing it to be cursed with murderous intent. The spirits of the victims, unwilling to rest in peace until the truth is exposed and justice is served, become the embodiment of the coaster itself and help the group expose the mayor's corrupt dealings. His reign of terror is brought to an end when he is confronted by the group and the police, leading to the arrest of Mayor Delaney and a formal investigation into Penrose's journal and the macabre experiments that occurred at Thrill Manor. In the end, the group succeeds in uncovering the dark truth behind the horrifying roller coaster, Mr. Bonestripper, thus putting a stop to the cycle of death and carnage. The spirits of the victims find peace and guide the friends to dismantle and destroy the cursed coaster, setting fire to its metallic skeleton in a spectacular and cathartic ending. With the curse lifted, the friends leave the town of Ravenwood, forever changed by their harrowing experience and with a newfound respect for the power of the supernatural. The Bonestripper Chronicles then concludes with a scene showing the ashes and remnants of Mr. Bonestripper, with the camera slowly panning out to reveal a smoldering black pearl nestled among the wreckage, symbolizing the darkness and horror that once resided in the deadly roller coaster."},{"instruction":"Title: Great design.

The reports claimed the Jirga was not the intended target and the predator was chasing a car before finally executing five people without any trial or due process near the Jirga. While this predator was hovering in the area, sophisticated cameras allegedly picked up images of a bigger gathering. Without appearing to have any intelligence or knowledge of its target, it fired four more missiles at the congregation. In the same month, a joint investigation by the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Sunday Times newspaper cited Pakistan's military commander in Waziristan at the time, Brigadier Abdullah Dogar: \\"We in the Pakistan military knew about the meeting, we'd got the request 10 days earlier. It was held in broad daylight, people were sitting out in Nomada bus depot when the missile strikes came. Maybe there were one or two Taliban at that Jirga -- they have their people attending -- but does that justify a drone strike which kills 42 mostly innocent people?\\" Opinion: Drone is Obama's weapon of choice. There should never be doubts. A big gathering in Waziristan does not mean they must be Taliban. To put it in perspective: My clients say drone attacks are now happening almost twice a week on Pakistani soil. Karim Khan, a tribal man by origin and a journalist by profession, is suing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for U.S.500 million for \\"his loss of blood.\\" He had only two options when his innocent 18-year-old son and brother, a primary school teacher, were killed in one such drone attack on December 31, 2009: to join the Taliban's war against the U.S. and take his revenge in a customary tribal way, or call on due process, the rule of law and judicial system of his state to gain justice for the wrong done to him. The first option would have continued the cycle of terror, which we witness in Pakistan in the shape of suicide attacks after almost every drone attack. Khan chose the latter and following him, dozens more families have come forth to seek justice through proper legal means. It is time now for the U.S. to respond to these grievances through legal means. Read: When are drone killings illegal? A similar fate awaited Fahim Qureshi, a teenager and another client from North Waziristan. U.S. President Barack Obama, the embodiment of \\"change\\" and \\"hope,\\" approved an escalation of the drone strikes in Pakistan by giving the CIA and U.S. military control of the program. Fahim's family house was destroyed by one such attack. The attack on January 23, 2009 resulted in the deaths of seven people present in the house, including three of Fahim's uncles, a cousin, and three family friends. Fahim was seriously injured and lost one eye. According to the New York Times, President Obama was later informed of this attack and civilian killings. The change he brought in was a record escalation of drone strikes in 2009, culminating in 344 attacks at the expense of 3,325 lives to date, according to TBIJ. The escalation would also change Fahim's life forever. The U.S. might never be able to win the \\"heart and mind\\" of this teenager from Pakistan's tribal area, who paid a high prize for faulty intelligence, a common mistake that CIA makes without any accountability. Under the authority of the U.S. President, drone attacks on Pakistani territory have been carried out by the CIA and U.S. military since 2004. This is an unprecedented move: a foreign government carrying out military strikes on an independent and sovereign state without declaring war. Earlier this year, Christof Heyns, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, warned that Washington was challenging a system of international law that had existed since the end of World War II and that it could even be guilty of war crimes. The government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that drone attacks are a violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Read: Drones decimating Taliban in Pakistan. What astounds me is the belief expressed by some scholars and politicians that drones are the only viable option for combating terrorism or militancy in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Experience and statistics tell a different story. The first drone attack was carried out in 2004 and had a specific target. This was true for all nine drone attacks that took place until 2007. However, identifying targets became shady as the number of strikes increased. After President Obama's oath of office, the drone attacks saw a sudden surge, accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid-2011, according to the New America Foundation. The TBIJ said available data showed from June 2004 to September 2012, drone strikes have killed 2,570 to 3,337 people in Pakistan, of whom 474 to 884 were civilians -- including 176 children. As a result of these attacks, the U.S. has only been able to achieve 41 high value targets, according to estimates by the New American Foundation. We have seen that with every assassination of militant leaders, they have been replaced with a more ferocious and extremist leader. Meanwhile, journalist Scott Shane told PBS in a response to an article he'd written in the New York Times, \\"there's also been some dispute over the way civilian casualties are counted. The CIA often counts able-bodied males, military-age males who are killed in strikes as militants, unless they have concrete evidence to sort of prove them innocent, and some folks at the State Department and elsewhere have questioned that kind of a process.\\" As a result, most adult males living in Waziristan seem to be viewed as militants and targets until the CIA rates them to be innocent, he added. Pakistan has also experienced a spike in suicide attacks when there has been a surge in drone attacks. In 2010, the year that saw the highest number of drone strikes, according to TBIJ, Pakistan government figures suggest the country witnessed its highest number of suicide attacks -- more than 2,100 civilians were killed without distinction between women, children, law enforcement or military. According to the Pakistan government, the total financial loss from terrorism in Pakistan between 2001-2010 was 68 billion, whereas the epicenter of all this chaos in our midst, the U.S., has given only 11 billion in military aid to Pakistan for its war on terror since 2001, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. A large portion of this damage is attributed to suicide attacks. America's own losses in Afghanistan -- financial, human, and tactical -- are difficult to quantify. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), more than 6 billion has been spent since 2002 on establishing a viable Afghan National Police force, which the late Richard Holbrooke called \\"an inadequate force riddled with corruption,\\" during a meeting in Brussels in 2009. The GAO says more than 10 billion of American taxpayers' money has been spent on building up the Afghan National Army, which was described in a report in the Wall Street Journal on July 28, 2010 as largely corrupt, poorly led, and subject to claims of drug use. The joint NATO and Afghan Operation Moshtrak in Afghanistan's Helmand province in February 2010 failed miserably in achieving its aimed objectives of evicting the Taliban and establishing a government in the district, despite the enormous budget and military backing of the Americans. Earlier this year, U.S. Senator John Kerry concluded that the operation did not become the turning point in the Afghan campaign as anticipated by NATO commanders. In fact 2011-2012 witnessed a surge in Taliban attacks on NATO and particularly American targets, showing there is no end to this war. This cycle of terror will continue until both sides start seeing sense and start adhering to the principles of due process, fair play, and rule of law. Through legal action, Karim Khan -- the first of 80 clients who came to us seeking justice for these attacks -- has shown a new path to his people to end the violence, which is largely attributed to mistakes committed by the state in the 1980s, along with the very same partner who is asking us to commit yet another folly. The American public should ask their government who is being killed in their name. Questioning the drone program in light of real facts is not anti-American -- violating the rule of law, due process and the \\"right to life\\" is. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.

If a ticket for a bumper car cost 2, a ticket for a space shuttle cost 4, and a ticket for a Ferris wheel cost 5, how much money did they spend? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To find the total amount of money that Mara and Riley spent, we will calculate how much money was spent on each ride and then add them all together. 1. Bumper car: Mara rode the bumper car two times, and each ride cost 2. Cost for Mara's bumper car rides = 2 rides * 2 per ride = 4 2. Space shuttle: Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and each ride cost 4. Cost for Riley's space shuttle rides = 4 rides * 4 per ride = 16 3. Ferris wheel: Both Mara and Riley rode the Ferris wheel three times each, and each ride cost 5. Cost for Mara's Ferris wheel rides = 3 rides * 5 per ride = 15 Cost for Riley's Ferris wheel rides = 3 rides * 5 per ride = 15 Now, we'll add the cost of all the rides to find the total amount they spent: Total amount spent = Mara's bumper car rides + Riley's space shuttle rides + Mara's Ferris wheel rides + Riley's Ferris wheel rides Total amount spent = 4 + 16 + 15 + 15 = 50 So, Mara and Riley spent a total of 50 on rides at the carnival."},{"instruction":"Solve 19*x - 195 + 317 = -9*x - 270 for x.","output":"To solve the equation 19*x - 195 + 317 = -9*x - 270 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. The left side of the equation has two constants: -195 and +317, while the right side only has one constant, -270. Combine constants on both sides as follows: Left side: (-195) + 317 = 122 So the equation becomes 19*x + 122 = -9*x - 270. Step 2: Move variable terms to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. First, let's move the -9*x term from the right side to the left side of the equation by adding 9*x to both sides: 19*x + 9*x + 122 = -270 Combine the x terms: 28*x + 122 = -270 Now, move the constant term (122) to the right side by subtracting it from both sides: 28*x = -270 - 122 Combine the constants on the right side: 28*x = -392 Step 3: Solve for x. Now, to isolate x, divide both sides by 28: x = -392 / 28 x = -14 So the solution to the equation 19*x - 195 + 317 = -9*x - 270 is x = -14."},{"instruction":"Paul earns 12.50 for each hour that he works.

Is performance of service provided by club Mahindra satisfactory? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; The two questions provided are asking about different topics of discussion. Let's break down each question and provide a detailed explanation for each. 1. Why do some people choose deliberately the negativity? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to why some people deliberately choose negativity, but a few potential reasons could include: a. Childhood or past experiences: A person's upbringing, along with traumatic or adverse experiences in their past, can shape their thought patterns and behaviors. They may have grown up around negative role models or in an environment where negativity was prevalent. b. Defense Mechanism: Some people may use negativity as a coping mechanism to protect themselves from disappointments or emotional pain. It could be that they purposely set low expectations for themselves and others to avoid feeling let down. c. Self-esteem and self-worth: A person with low self-esteem or sense of self-worth may struggle with negative thoughts and emotions. They may feel unworthy of success, happiness, or positive outcomes, and thus, unconsciously engage in negative thoughts and behaviors. d. Habit: For some, negativity can become a learned habit over time. They might initially engage in negative thinking as a response to a particular situation, but eventually, it becomes ingrained in their overall personality. e. Attention-seeking: In some cases, individuals may use negativity as a means to gain attention or sympathy from others. They might feel that negative behavior is more rewarding or noticeable than maintaining a positive attitude. 2. Is the performance of service provided by Club Mahindra satisfactory? Club Mahindra is a holiday resort chain in India, and satisfaction with their services would be subjective, depending on individual experiences. However, some factors that might influence the satisfaction levels of customers include: a. Quality of Accommodations: The condition, cleanliness, and comfort of Club Mahindra's resorts can significantly impact guests' overall satisfaction. b. Amenities and Activities: Club Mahindra offers several activities and amenities to guests, including swimming pools, restaurants, spa services, and adventure activities. How well the company executes these offerings can influence customer satisfaction. c. Customer service: Courteous, efficient, and knowledgeable staff contributes significantly to guests' pleasant experiences at Club Mahindra resorts. Good customer service can make a stay more enjoyable, while poor service can have the opposite effect. d. Value for Money: Customers who feel they are receiving an excellent product and experience for the price they paid will be more likely satisfied with the service provided by Club Mahindra. e. Membership Benefits: Club Mahindra operates on a membership basis, where customers purchase annual memberships to access their resorts. The satisfaction with membership benefits and the experience of club members can affect their overall opinion of the brand. In conclusion, the two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question delves into the reasons behind people's deliberate choice of negativity, while the second question seeks an evaluation of the service provided by Club Mahindra."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?.

He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health.

The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management.

Review: \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\" is a fine book not only by fantasy standards. It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review for \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\" is positive. This conclusion can be derived from the commendatory language the reviewer uses and the explicit appreciation they express for the varied themes tackled by the book. The reviewer appreciates the author's writing style, mentioning that it is \\"precise and clear\\" despite the complexity of the fantasy genre and the multitude of profound themes tackled in the book. They note that the author's experience in writing scientific papers has notably influenced and enhanced this style. This counts as a positive, as being able to communicate complex ideas and narratives clearly and concisely is a sought after quality in writing. They have also positively highlighted the patience and attention to detail in the book's pacing. Although they note that the pace is more \\"relaxed\\" than typical for the genre, they seem to view this as an advantage, stating that the \\"extra words per unit of action are worth reading\\". This indicates that they believe the book is thoughtfully and thoroughly written, once again contributing to a positive review. Additionally, the reviewer remarks that the book is \\"mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life\\", implicitly commending its sensitive treatment of these subjects. Even in their critique, where they suggest fans of the \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" saga may not enjoy the novel, they balance it out by proposing that fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it. This critique appears more as a heads-up about the book's style, rather than an outright negative comment. All these aspects - appreciation for the author's writing style, the pace of the narrative, the sympathetic portrayal of harsh realities, and a specific audience recommendation - suggest that the reviewer looks favorably on \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\".

Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycleâwhich Nic has forbiddenâand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair. Nic is devastated, but Jules assures she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. Joni and Laser have overheard the arguments and are also upset at Jules. The household becomes tense and Jules is forced to sleep on the couch. Paul thinks he has fallen in love with...

The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide. After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. The band's second album, entitled \\"Teen Spirit\\", featured a compilation of tracks that were not ABBA covers and when it was finally released on 26 February 2001, it debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. This pop sensation hit reached the top ten in other countries and entered at number eighty-three on the World Charts, number thirteen on the European Albums Chart, number fourteen on CNN's WorldBeat Album Charts and peaked at number fifty in the United States selling over 60,000 copies in its first two weeks, ensuring Gold Status for sales exceeding the 500,000 copies in the United States alone. Prior to the release of the album, the A-Teens became one of the first bands to broadcast one of their shows on MSN's Websites. The UK releases were delayed due to A-Teens' failure with their previous album in that country. When \\"Upside Down\\" was released there in May 2001, it became their biggest hit in the country. The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom becoming their only top ten hit in that country. The album was delayed and released after the second single, \\"Halfway Around The World\\" in late October 2001. The single barely made the top thirty and the album did not chart in the top 75. Before they started their concert tour in the U.S. the band went to promote their album to Asia, with stops in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia where they did show for MTV Asia and Thailand, with great success, especially in the former where Coca-Cola signed the band to become the face of the brand there and promote, \\"We were the first international artists ever to appear on a soda can there. They printed 15 million of them; we went home with ten!\\" Remembers Sara, The cans were distributed around the country that year. Also in 2001, the A-Teens performed as top billing during the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour in Chicago and Philadelphia markets. The group promoted their album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter around the U.S. Back in Europe, the band toured with No Angels in Germany. By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit went on to sell over 1 million copies worldwide and were invited by Walt Disney/Buena Vista to record the European soundtrack for the movie \\"The Princess Diaries\\". As the movie had already been released in North and South America, the movie was set to be released in Europe in the winter 2001. \\"Heartbreak Lullaby\\" a song written by Cathy Dennis (famous for writing Kylie Minogue's number one hit, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\") and Kasmanaut, the video was shot in Germany in late October, in the middle of their tour. The single was released in December 2001 and it became another top ten hit for the band in their home country spending four months inside the charts.

Very little about the reason for the political crisis has appeared in the London-based national press, but it has been front page news in Ireland, north and south, for a couple of weeks. So, before I continue, you need to know that the story began with the murder on 12 August of a former IRA member, Kevin McGuigan. The Guardian’s Irish correspondent, Henry McDonald, immediately reported that the killing had “the potential to destabilise the already fragile power-sharing coalition at the devolved parliament in Stormont.” Why? Because it was suggested that McGuigan had been killed by former IRA members as a retaliation for McGuigan having murdered another former senior IRA member, Gerard Davison, in early May. That killing, also reported by McDonald, got almost no mention elsewhere. Ten days later, a statement by the head of Northern Ireland’s police service (PSNI), George Hamilton, set the story alight. He said the Provisional IRA still existed and that individual members had been involved in killing McGuigan. But Hamilton also said the IRA’s leadership had not sanctioned McGuigan’s murder. He was quoted as saying: “Some of the PIRA structure from the 1990s remains broadly in place, although its purpose has radically changed since this period.” Aside from the Guardian, most of the UK papers that bothered to cover Hamilton’s intervention, relied on Press Association copy: Daily Telegraph examples here on 21 August and on the following day. The Independent carried a short report on 23 August, which was clearly no more than rewritten agency copy, and a longer piece, “They haven’t gone away you know”, the following Saturday (not online).* The Times did not catch up with the story’s significance until 24 August with a piece by its new Irish political editor, Niamh Lyons, in which she reported that Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin president, had been forced to deny that the IRA is still in operation for the second time in three days. Adams also said the murders of Davison and McGuigan were being used “opportunistically and cynically” to attack Sinn Féin. Some four days later, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUO), Mike Nesbitt, threatened to pull out of the five-party ruling coalition at Stormont. The predicted power-sharing crisis was on its way. By this time, newspapers across the island of Ireland were carrying articles in which commentators argued about whether or not the IRA existed. But there was no such analysis in the UK. The under-reporting of Northern Ireland politics, increasingly evident over recent years after national papers withdrew their correspondents, means that the people who ultimately hold the fate of those six Irish counties in their hands (British voters) are denied relevant information. It also means that the actors involved in the drama escape from the necessary scrutiny that is the hallmark of Britain’s national press when dealing with major stories. For a start, I cannot imagine any British-based chief constable getting away with such an ambivalent statement as that made by the PSNI’s Hamilton without being subjected to intense daily pressure to explain himself. He set unionism’s political hares running with a confusing set of allegations that required relentless journalistic questioning. By forcing him to be more transparent it is possible that there would be no political crisis. He was, in effect, let off the hook. By saying the IRA still exists he must have known the likely outcome. It was manna from heaven for unionists who dislike sharing power with Sinn Féin. Where was Hamilton’s evidence? Even if we accept that he is right in saying that former IRA members were responsible for McGuigan’s murder, in what way does that prove the organisation itself exists? Following Hamilton’s inept statement Sinn Féin has found itself in an impossible position: how do you prove a negative? Their spokespeople have routinely said that the IRA doesn’t exist in the face of interviewers quoting Hamilton’s claim that “the structure” exists. The nonsense continued today (Wednesday) with the Times’s leading article, It is time for Sinn Fein to complete the dismantling of the Provisionals. The paper said: “It must be evident to all by now that the residual elements of the Provisional IRA, still enjoying contacts with Sinn Fein, have to be properly disowned and cast into well-deserved obscurity. There is only so much longer that a democratic party can run with the fox and hunt with the hounds.” Why is that nonsense? Well, given that unionists (and supportive British politicians and newspapers) are predisposed not to believe in Sinn Féin’s claim that the IRA was disbanded long ago and no longer exists, how could the party ever convince anyone that it has “properly disowned” is former military wing? It does not take us any further forward. Again, the lack of interest from UK newspapers (allied to their anti-republican agenda) allows unionists to escape criticism for their stance. In what way does collapsing Stormont change the situation? Direct rule would not change matters. Sinn Féin would go on saying the IRA didn’t exist. If there were to be new assembly elections, with every likelihood that voters would return the same parties to Stormont in similar numbers, the situation wouldn’t change. How can Sinn Féin convince those who refuse to believe it that the IRA has gone away for ever? The black irony is that the only way it could possibly “control” former members bent on criminal behaviour is by reforming the IRA to bring them to heel. Finally, I must mention a column published last Friday in the Irish edition of the Daily Mirror by Pat Flanagan. He derided the leaders of two Irish parties - Labour’s Joan Burton and Fianna Fail’s Micheál Martin - by arguing that they had “scrambled aboard the McGuigan murder bandwagon”. He accused them of ignoring other murders in the Republic because there was “no political mileage to be made from their deaths” and added: “Also there wasn’t the same reaction from this pair when 16-year-old Phoebe Clawson was seriously injured after a loyalist drove his car into a crowd during the Twelfth ‘celebrations’. The alleged driver, John Aughey, who has been charged with attempted murder [which he denies], is a leading member of the Orange Order which, unlike Sinn Féin, doesn’t pose a political threat to Labour or Fianna Fail, so the bandwagon remained in the garage.” It reminded me that Phoebe Clawson’s ordeal had been widely overlooked also by the British press. A quick search reveals that few papers even covered the story. Yet again, the perils of the under-reporting of Northern Ireland mean that there is no press pressure on organisations, such as the Orange Order, that have definitely not gone away. Full disclosure: I have written in the past for the Sinn Féin newspaper, An Phoblacht *This paragraph was amended on 6 September to take account of the second Independent article which, as stated, was not accessible online.","output":"A big issue happened in Northern Ireland that made a lot of people living there upset and worried.

In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the 77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money.

The Atlantic reports Trump is seeking to meet with the NRA about keeping people on terror watch lists from buying guns. “If Con Man Don can convince the NRA to move forward on this, God bless him,” one Democratic lawmaker from New York says. And while the situation shows Trump's willingness to break with the larger GOP, it also—as NPR argues—shows Trump lacks a deeper understanding of many issues.

He's walked back many of those statements, but his earlier positions put him in line with the majority of Americans.

Is the following a factual statement? \\"Superman cannot get hurt or die.\\" Options: - yes - no If the answer is 'no'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is 'no'. The statement \\"Superman cannot get hurt or die\\" is not entirely factual. Although Superman is an extremely powerful and nearly invulnerable character in the DC comics, he does have some vulnerabilities. 1. Kryptonite: Superman's most famous weakness is Kryptonite, a radioactive mineral from his home planet Krypton. Exposure to Kryptonite can weaken him, cause immense pain, and even kill him. There are different colors of Kryptonite that affect him in various ways, but green Kryptonite is the most lethal. 2. Magic: Superman is also vulnerable to magic. While he has no specific weakness to any particular form of magic, he faces a greater risk of harm when facing magical attacks as his resistance to such forces isn't as robust as his resistance to physical and energy-based attacks. 3. Red Sun Radiation: Superman's superpowers are derived from Earth's yellow Sun. However, if he's exposed to the radiation from a red Sun, like the one in Krypton's solar system, his powers will gradually weaken, and he will become mortal. In this state, he can be hurt and potentially die. 4. Extreme force: While it's incredibly difficult to hurt Superman using brute force, it's not entirely impossible. Some characters in the DC Universe, such as Doomsday, have successfully injured or even killed Superman in comic book storylines. In \\"The Death of Superman\\" storyline, Superman and Doomsday engage in a devastating battle that results in both characters dying.

They report shoppers are more likely to engage in leisurely browsing—and ultimately purchase books in certain popular genres, including romance novels—if the store is infused with the scent of chocolate. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Writing in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, a research team led by Lieve Doucé of Hasselt University describes a 10-day experiment conducted in a general-interest bookstore in Belgium. “Retailers can make use of pleasant ambient scents to improve the store environment, leading consumers to explore the store.” For approximately half of its open-for-business hours (either morning or afternoon, depending upon the specific day), the scent of chocolate was dispersed into the store from two locations. The smell was subtle enough that it wasn’t immediately noticeable, but strong enough so that it could be instantly identified once it was pointed out. Researchers tracked the actions of every fifth customer to enter the store—a total of 201 people. They report that when the scent was activated, shoppers showed a greater tendency to take their time, check out a variety of titles, and/or chat with an employee. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Specifically, “customers were 2.22 times more likely to closely examine multiple books when the chocolate scent was present in the store, compared with the control condition,” they write. In addition, when the aroma was present, shoppers were less likely to search out one specific book and take it directly to the cash register. Something about the store’s environment made them want to hang out a bit longer than they perhaps had planned. The researchers tracked sales of books in four popular genres. A panel of students had previously ranked two of them (food and drink and romance novels) as congruent with the smell of chocolate, and another two (history books and mysteries/crime thrillers) as particularly incongruent with that aroma. Altogether, 119 of the 201 tracked shoppers bought at least one book in one of those categories. They report sales for books in the first category increased by an impressive 40 percent when the chocolate smell was in the air. Perhaps even more encouragingly, those in the second category also rose, by a more modest but still substantial 22 percent, over the hours when the store was scentless. Interestingly, the customers were more likely to check out the crime thrillers and history volumes when the aroma was absent. The scent of chocolate apparently steered people away from those genres. But after controlling for the gender of the observed shoppers, sales of those books increased anyway during the chocolate-scented hours, apparently because those who did peruse the mystery or history aisles were more likely to buy multiple volumes. These results lead the authors to offer some practical advice: “Retailers can make use of pleasant ambient scents to improve the store environment, leading consumers to explore the store.” Ideally, they add, the scents should be congruent with the merchandise on sale—say, the salty smell of the sea for a surf shop. It’s certainly worth a try for hard-pressed independent bookstores—or even for a certain struggling chain. Indeed, the customer-pleasing power of chocolate might even inspire thoughts of a merger. Who wouldn’t want to shop at Barnes and Nestlés? ||||| The aims of this research were to (1) explore the different effects of an ambient scent of chocolate on general approach versus goal-directed behavior, and (2) investigate whether an ambient chocolate scent diffused in a retail environment has a positive effect on consumers' behavior toward thematically congruent products. A field study with 201 participants shows that a chocolate scent positively influences general approach behavior and negatively influences goal-directed behavior in a bookstore. Moreover, when gender is controlled for, the chocolate scent improves approach and buying behavior toward thematically congruent books and decreases approach and buying behavior toward incongruent books. Sales figures also provide some indicative support for the findings. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Researchers in Belgium found that the smell of chocolate in a bookstore made people want to stay longer and buy more books. They did an experiment where they put the chocolate scent in the store and then watched what the customers did. The customers looked at more books and talked to the employees more when the store smelled like chocolate. They also bought more books about food, drinks, and romance stories. The researchers think that nice smells can help make stores better for customers and make them explore more."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) discovers members of his squad and various villagers dead, all with their ears removed. Deveraux finds his leader Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who has gone insane, with a string of severed ears and holding a young boy and girl hostage. Devereaux, who is near the end of his tour of duty, tries to reason with Scott, who shoots the boy and orders Devereaux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses and tries to save the girl, but Scott kills her with a grenade. The two soldiers shoot each other to death. Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and cryo-genically frozen, their deaths covered up as \\"missing in action\\". Deveraux and Scott are revived without memories of their previous lives and are selected for the \\"Universal Soldier\\" program, an elite counter terrorism unit, and are deployed via an Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy to the Hoover Dam to resolve a hostage situation. Devereaux used efficient means to dispatch terrorists, but Scott used excessive force, which causes concern among the project technicians. The team demonstrates their superior training and physical abilities against the terrorists, such as when GR76 (Ralf MÃ¶ller) withstands close-range rifle fire. After the area is secured, Devereaux begins to regain patches of memory from his former life upon seeing two hostages who strongly resemble the villagers he tried to save in Vietnam, causing him to ignore commands from the control team and become unresponsive. In the mobile command center, it is revealed that the UniSols are genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced healing abilities and superior strength, but also have a tendency to overheat and shut down. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their previous memories suppressed.

Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are \\"CB\\" (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is \\"T\\". Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the CBC North stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with \\"CF\\" due to their historic association with the CBC's Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting.

Here is a question with a detailed analysis: Question: \\"According to the passage, how does multi-tasking impact the performance of a computer running several programs simultaneously, and how does interaction with input/output devices affect this scenario?\\" The answer will judge the student's understanding in a few areas. Firstly, the student needs to understand and explain the concept of multitasking within the context of computers. According to the first part of the passage, \\"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running.\\" So the student would need to address the speculation that a computer running multiple programs at once would slow down proportionally with the number of programs it runs concurrently. Secondly, the student must grasp the idea that most programs spend a lot of time \\"waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks.\\" They need to understand the implication here, which is that the process isn't continuous or seamless but rather frequently interrupted by these waiting periods. Lastly, the student must connect this understanding to the latter part of the passage, which states, \\"If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a 'time slice' until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\\" They must explain how these idle times actually enable multitasking without significant speed loss – a conclusion that seems to contradict the initial speculation. Overall, this question is expected to test the student's ability to comprehend and synthesize information in the form of explaining concepts, identifying presumptions, arguing processes, and stating conclusions in the context of computer programs and multitasking. The reader must show understanding not only of the ideas presented directly but also of underlying assumptions and implications.

Original sentence: \\"Gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern.\\" 1. \\"Gollum\\" is a proper noun - a character name - and doesn't need any translation. So, it remains \\"Gollum.\\" 2. \\"withdrew\\" is a verb (past simple), which in Czech would be \\"odešel\\" (masculine, past, singular) since Gollum is a male character. 3. \\"grumbling\\" is a present participle that functions as an adverb in this sentence. In Czech, it translates to \\"stěžujíc si\\" (angrily complaining). 4. \\"and\\" is a conjunction that can be translated to \\"a\\" in Czech. 5. \\"crawled\\" is another verb (past simple), which can be translated to \\"lezl\\" (masculine, past, singular - matched to Gollum's gender). 6. \\"into\\" is a preposition, in this context it translates to \\"do\\" in Czech. 7. \\"the fern\\" is a noun phrase. In Czech, \\"fern\\" is \\"paprat\\" (feminine, singular).

Another policeman was shot and injured after a night of horrific violence between the police and hundreds of black and white youths. By midnight 58 policemen and 24 other people have been taken to hospital. It is the first time shots have been fired in a British riot. The trouble was sparked off by the death of local resident Cynthia Jarrett who died of heart failure after four policemen burst into her home during a raid yesterday. Earlier today, her family met to discuss her death with the police and demanded an inquiry. They made it clear they did not want any kind of public disorder. Britain's first black council leader, Haringey's Bernie Grant, issued a statement condemning the police for the way they searched Mrs Jarrett's house. Bricks thrown from walkways The trouble began at 1845 GMT when police were called to Mount Pleasant, Willan Road and The Avenue. They were pelted with bottles and petrol bombs, cars were overturned and set alight as were shops and other buildings. There was widespread looting. About 500 police with shields, helmets and truncheons battled with rampaging youths threw bricks, bottles and cans from walkways within the estate as fires turned the night sky red. At around 2145 GMT several gunshots were heard and one officer was shot and seriously wounded in Griffin Road. Half an hour later a police officer was stabbed in the neck, suffering serious injuries. He died later in hospital. Ten minutes after the stabbing another officer was shot and slightly wounded. One senior officer said: \\"This is not England. This is just madness. My men are being used as target practice.\\" He said three of his men had sufferd burns but that the police did not have the resources to tackle the intense violence. \\"We haven't got the weapons to combat this kind of sickening violence.\\" Teargas equipment is on site but senior commanders are reluctant to use it for fear of harming residents trapped inside their homes. Police have blocked entrances to the estate to contain the riot. The Tottenham riots come just a week after violence erupted in Brixton, south London following the accidental shooting of Cherry Groce. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Andy Moore reports from behind police lines after a BBC satellite truck came under attack from youths throwing missiles Police are on the streets of Tottenham, north London, where overnight riots saw petrol bombs thrown at officers and patrol cars and buildings set alight. Eight injured police officers were taken in hospital, at least one of them with head injuries. The unrest began after a protest over the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan on Thursday. About 300 people gathered outside the police station on the High Road after demonstrators demanded \\"justice\\". London Ambulance Service said a total of 10 people had been treated and nine had been taken to hospital. Two empty patrol cars were set alight at about 20:20 BST. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cdr Stephen Watson: \\"We had no information to suggest that we would have the scale of disorder that now confronts us\\" Shops in the area were looted, with people seen pushing away shopping trolleys full of goods. One local resident told the BBC that looting continued beyond daybreak on Sunday. A double-decker bus was set on fire at the junction of High Road and Brook Street while a shop on the High Road was also set alight. Fire crews were initially unable to reach the shop due to the disorder but later began tackling the flames. A BBC TV news crew and satellite truck also came under attack from youths throwing missiles. The youths had begun attacking another police patrol car before the TV crew were targeted and they were withdrawn in the interests of their own safety. The police car was later set alight. The BBC's Andy Moore says the rioters appear to have dispersed on Sunday morning and police were trying to restore calm. Our correspondent says that since riots in 1985 relations between the local community and police have been generally good, but last week's shooting raised tension. He says elements of the community were looking for instant answers but the investigation into Mr Duggan's death would be more long-term. 'Calm and normality' Commander Stephen Watson, of the Metropolitan Police, earlier told BBC News a significant number of officers had been deployed with the aim of restoring \\"calm and normality to the area as soon as possible\\". Police were continuing to deal with \\"isolated pockets of criminality\\" involving a few people, he said in a statement. Mr Watson said police did not have warnings of last night's level of disorder, despite being aware of raised tensions after Mr Duggan's death. \\"What we experienced earlier on yesterday evening was a peaceful protest outside Tottenham police station - there was no indication it would deteriorate in this way. For those who involved themselves in this level of violence, there is no excuse.\\" Tottenham MP David Lammy appealed for calm on Saturday, saying: \\"The scenes currently taking place in our community are not representative of the vast majority of people in Tottenham. \\"Those who remember the destructive conflicts of the past will be determined not to go back to them. Image caption Emergency services remained on Tottenham streets on Sunday morning \\"We already have one grieving family in our community and further violence will not heal that pain. \\"True justice can only follow a thorough investigation of the facts. \\"The Tottenham community and Mark Duggan's family and friends need to understand what happened on Thursday evening when Mark lost his life. To understand those facts, we must have calm.\\" Protesters are believed to have gathered outside the police station at about 17:00 BST. The force said the situation turned violent when two patrol cars parked about 200 metres away on Forster Road and High Road were attacked. The spokesman said: \\"A number of bottles were thrown at these two cars - one was set alight and the second was pushed into the middle of the High Road. It was subsequently set slight. \\"The officers were not in the vehicles and were unhurt.\\" A friend of Mr Duggan, who gave her name as Niki, 53, said marchers had wanted \\"justice for the family\\" and \\"something had to be done\\". She said some of them lay in the road to make their point. \\"They're making their presence known because people are not happy,\\" she added. \\"This guy was not violent. Yes, he was involved in things but he was not an aggressive person. He had never hurt anyone.\\" Vanessa Robinson said she had joined the original protest outside the police station and it had begun peacefully. She said the situation had then turned into \\"absolute chaos\\". One person at the scene, who gave his name as Tim, said: \\"It's an absolute war zone. I walked up there. \\"I saw about five youths, all faces covered up. They set a wheelie bin on fire and threw it into the riot police. Toughened glass \\"The whole of the police station is surrounded by... about 100 police officers in riot gear and they threw a wheelie bin into it and then started throwing bricks, street signs, anything they could get their hands on, straight at them.\\" Another resident, David Akinsanya, 46, said several shop windows had been smashed. He said: \\"There was a police line of about 15 riot police sort of in front of the police station on the north side and then there were loads of uniformed officers on the south side of the police station. \\"They weren't making any effort to go into the crowd. Every now and again they would rush the crowd and the crowd would run. \\"But there seems to be a lot of anger in Tottenham tonight... as I left they were starting to attack the police station.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amateur footage shows clashes between police and protesters near the police station in Tottenham The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the shooting of Mr Duggan.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Previously the Welsh government said it wanted to restrict the use of e-cigarettes in exactly the same way as tobacco. It was concerned their use may \\"normalise\\" smoking for children and young people while ministers feared they may act as a \\"gateway\\" into smoking tobacco. The ban, intended to come into force in 2017, would have been a first in the UK. Ministers pointed to concerns by the World Health Organisation and steps taken in 40 other countries to regulate e-cigarettes, but it divided opinion among health and medical groups. Some anti-smoking groups including Ash Wales, Cancer Research UK and Tenovus opposed restrictions, saying they helped smokers kick the habit. A major review by Public Health England found e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than tobacco and could be prescribed on the NHS in future to help smokers quit. Before Tuesday's debate, experts from universities and the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training wrote to AMs claiming there was no evidence to justify the legislation. They claimed it would discourage smokers to switch from smoking to e-cigarettes. Public Health Wales, local health boards and the BMA supported the curbs while opposition politicians called it a \\"huge step backwards\\". The proposals also divided the group of AMs which looked in detail at the proposal. The five Labour members supported curbs on e-cigarettes but they were opposed by four opposition AMs. Less stringent restrictions on e-cigarettes than those on tobacco were suggested and that appears now to have been accepted by the health minister. ANALYSIS by Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent The decision this afternoon can be interpreted in two ways. Some critics will view it an embarrassing climb down - and ask why did the health minister press ahead with the proposed ban in the face of significant opposition and unclear evidence. Supporters of the Welsh government will say he has acted responsibly, listened to the debate and acted accordingly - an example perhaps of democracy in action. The watering down of the proposed e-cigarette ban in public places does raise some questions about what exactly the Welsh government's flagship Public Health Bill will now ultimately achieve. Previously, a plan to introduce a minimum price for alcohol from the bill was taken out and introduced as separate legislation over fears of legal challenges. Perhaps the decision today reflects the health minister's fears that without a majority a political row about the scope of e-cigs ban could scupper the entire legislation. This whole debate also raises another question about the role of government and the timing of the bill. In seeking to restrict the use of e-cigarettes, were ministers acting responsibly to protect the public, just in case they were found to act as a gateway to tobacco? Or was the Welsh government here being premature, too willing without evidence to interfere in people's lives? This article was about:","output":"The Welsh government has recently announced a backtrack on plans to ban the use of e-cigarettes in public places, after concerns were raised about the lack of evidence to justify such restrictions. Instead, the Public Health Bill will be amended so that e-cigarettes will only be banned in schools, eating establishments, and on public transportation. The change comes after a major review by Public Health England found that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco and could potentially be prescribed on the NHS to help smokers quit. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said that while his personal views have not changed, he recognized that it is his responsibility to find a reasonable agreement on this issue. He said that he will bring forward amendments to clearly define the enclosed spaces where e-cigarettes would be prohibited. The debate surrounding e-cigarette restrictions in Wales has been divisive, with some anti-smoking groups and local health boards in support, while Cancer Research UK, universities, and opposition politicians argue that the ban would discourage smokers from switching to a less harmful alternative. Despite the changes, the revised restrictions on e-cigarettes will still be more stringent than those on conventional tobacco products, and the ban is planned to come into effect in 2017. It will be the first e-cigarette ban of its kind in the UK, and has garnered attention from the World Health Organisation, and other countries that have implemented or are considering e-cigarette legislation."},{"instruction":"Question: Who are the Fung Sisters known as?

Fung Ling and Lam are also in love, but do not acknowledge it. Emperor Tsao hires the Hons to capture the Nine-Tails Fox, whom he claims has made a major robbery of his household, including the rape and murder of his daughter and the murder of 41 servants. The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase them (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) chase the Hons to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the apsara known as Flying Cat to walk out on him. The group discovers that Never Die is allergic to glib talk, and begin speaking to each other glibly, Chung, too embarrassed to speak to Lady Fung in that way, speaking to Nine-Tails Fox, and the two pulling off each other shirts, and trap him. Never Die soon dissolves, and the four bounty hunters and Never Die's hand take him away. Flying Cat returns to find drawn images of what has gone on previously, including what she interprets as her husband's homosexual behavior, and chastises the old man who sends the drawings out through a slot for not intervening, which he says is not his place. Nine-Tails Fox, who proudly admits to being a thief but insists he never hurts anyone, escapes from the bounty hunters to the inn of Pang Tin-hong, where he becomes involved with numerous courtesans.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Her rival at the club, Clo-Clo, not wanting to be upstaged, startles the animal and it escapes the club into the dark night. The owner of the leopard, a solo sideshow performer named Charlie How-Come—billed as \\"The Leopard Man\\"—begins pestering Manning for money for replacement of the leopard.

I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated.

Context: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

Answer the question: If you are deflating a balloon with water it will get smaller or larger? A:","output":"When you deflate a balloon filled with water, it will become smaller in size. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first discuss the primary components relevant to this phenomenon: the balloon, the water, and the relationship between pressure and volume. The Balloon: Balloons are made of elastic materials such as latex or rubber, which are characterized by their ability to stretch and contract based on the forces exerted on them. These materials exhibit elasticity – the property that allows them to return to their original shape after the applied force is removed. When you inflate a balloon, you are introducing a force that stretches the elastic material, which, in turn, increases its size and creates a higher internal pressure. The Water: Water is an incompressible fluid, which means that it does not significantly change its volume under pressure. Due to this property, water-filled balloons behave differently than air-filled balloons. When you deflate an air-filled balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon decreases, allowing the elastic material to contract and creating a smaller balloon. In the case of a water-filled balloon, deflating it means removing some quantity of water from the balloon. The Relationship Between Pressure and Volume: The concept of pressure-volume relationship comes from Boyle's law, which states that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume at a constant temperature. In simpler terms, as the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure increases, and vice versa. However, since water is an incompressible fluid, Boyle's law does not apply to water-filled balloons. Nonetheless, deflating a water-filled balloon essentially reduces the content (water) inside the balloon, thus it gets smaller in volume. So, when you are deflating a balloon with water, the volume of the water decreases as you remove the water, causing the elastic material to retract due to the reduction in pressure exerted by the water. This contraction leads to the decrease in the size of the balloon."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: the yen steadied in early trading here on monday , finding a floor after weakness in tokyo in response to a run on the cosmo credit company , and in paris the french franc , which had been strong against the mark last week , slipped .

No hiding place: Ryan Giggs (left) has been appointed interim manager at United following the sacking of David Moyes (right) The United hierarchy’s explanation for allowing Ferguson to effectively select his successor was that it made sense to trust the judgement of someone with so much success and who was still on the payroll as a £2million-a-year ambassador. United's board clearly remain keen to maintain links with the Ferguson era, however, as they have appointed Ryan Giggs as interim manager, with Nicky Butt his assistant. Sportsmail understands that Phil Neville remains part of the back-room set up despite Moyes' departure. The club are also intent on luring Paul Scholes back in to the Old Trafford fold after the departure of Moyes, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier today. Scholes has hardly been seen at the club since doing some work with Under 19s manager Nicky Butt earlier this season after becoming disillusioned with what he felt were half-hearted attempts by Moyes to find him a role. Now that Moyes has been sacked as United. manager, the club will do everything they can to fit their former. midfield player in to their coaching set-up as they look to retain a. connection with the club’s glorious past behind the scenes. With United set to appoint a foreign manager to replace Moyes the club are concerned that ties with the past could be cut. Ryan Giggs is now the club interim manager and will be retained whatever happens this summer but Phil Neville could follow Moyes out of the club after serving as a coach under the Scot while brother Gary and David Beckham are pursuing other careers. United had no plans in place to reintroduce Scholes to the coaching staff while Moyes was in charge and a source close to the club revealed to Sportsmail last month that the situation was unlikely to change. Scholes teamed up with Butt to help his former team-mate coach the United youngsters for the UEFA youth league in the autumn but this arrangement was on a purely voluntary, non-contracted basis. It was orchestrated by Butt, rather than Moyes, and it remained a temporary role. Last summer, Scholes turned down the chance to play a leading role on Moyes' staff, citing a wish to spend some time with his family before making his return to football. No 2: Nicky Butt has been promoted from coach of United's Under 19s to assistant boss in Ryan Giggs new interim regime. Returning hero?

Sir Alex was very good at his job and helped the team win many trophies. Manchester United wanted him to help choose the next manager because they trust his opinion.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When learning the alphabet, one typically begins with the first few letters recited as \\"A, B, C, D, E...\\" If we consider the order of the alphabet as a sequence of letters, it becomes evident that the letter B precedes a specific letter. The English alphabet has 26 letters, and understanding the order of these letters is crucial. Since A is the first letter, and B is the second, logically, the following letter should be the third letter. The position of this letter in the sequence can be used to deduce which letter comes after B. By knowing the alphabet and following its order, it becomes clear that C is the letter that comes after B. Therefore, the answer is (C)."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions?

Movie title: Take Me Home Tonight Movie plot: Set in 1988, the film begins in a music store with recent MIT graduate Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), his twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his best friend Barry Nathan (Dan Fogler) as they try to figure out when to see Matt's dream girl Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer). Following graduation, Matt has been working at a Suncoast Video store at a local shopping mall while trying to figure out what to do with his life. While working one day, Tori randomly walks into the store. When she asks him where he works, he lies and tells her he's at Goldman Sachs. Tori then invites him to a Labor Day weekend party held by Wendy's boyfriend Kyle Masterson (Chris Pratt). Matt, Barry and Wendy drive to the party later that night, but before they arrive, Barry steals a car from the dealership from where he got fired earlier in the day for his bad sales record.At the party, Kyle challenges people to ride the \\"ball,\\" a hollow steel sphere that is supposed to ride down the street. Matt runs into Carlos (Demetri Martin), a high school classmate who actually works at Goldman Sachs.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"Take Me Home Tonight\\", Matt Franklin, played by Topher Grace, lies to Tori Frederking about where he works because he's embarrassed about his job at Suncoast video. He had recently graduated from MIT and was working in a video store, a situation that didn't seem to align with his educational achievements. He probably felt that working at such a place didn't make him appear successful or remarkable in any way, especially compared to his peers. When Tori, his long-time crush, unexpectedly walks into his store, he seizes the opportunity to lie about his job to impress her, telling her that he works at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs, known for being a prominent investment bank and financial services company, certainly holds more prestige and would make him appear more successful in Tori's eyes. It's a lie that presumably he hopes will give him a better chance with her. This reflects the societal pressure to 'appear' successful, and it also sheds light on Matt's insecurities about his current job and life situation. Mostly, Matt wanted to win Tori's admiration and show her a side of him that aligns with the societal definitions of success. He may have thought that admitting to working at a video store wouldn't seem nearly as impressive to Tori, undermining his chances with her. Hence, the lie was an attempt to appear successful and promising to Tori, even if it potentially compromised the trust between them later on. However, this lie creates a plot point that brings about dramatic tension and conflict in the storyline. When the truth emerges that he doesn't work at Goldman Sachs, it causes a rift between Matt and Tori. So from a storytelling perspective, the lie serves to intensify and complicate the relationship between Matt and Tori, making the story more engaging and unpredictable to the viewer."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: of removing the firing pin for the following movie plot: The fifth Thin Man movie found Nick on a reform streak: he traveled in third class coach, he's quit drinking, and he was going home to Sycamore Springs, to visit his parents.Nora soon found that Nick and his father grew apart after Dr. Charles saw that Nick was not going to follow his footstep and join the medical profession, but wanted to become a detective.

He was pondering about how human legacy would be viewed in the future. For that, he was very interested in technofossils. He located a site with ample evidence of technofossils. He noted that site as site A. To compare site A with a site with no technofossils he located another site. He noted that site as site B. Would site A see less or more litter and debris depostied than site B? Hint: Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as \\"technofossils.\\"Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions. An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the red junglefowl Gallus gallus, native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites. Hence, landfills are important resources to find \\"technofossils\\". A:","output":"Based on the provided information, Site A, which has ample evidence of technofossils, would likely see more litter and debris deposited than Site B, which has no technofossils. The presence of technofossils indicates human activity and impact on the environment, and engineered structures, as well as debris and litter, tend to be buried and preserved in areas with a depositional regime. Furthermore, human intervention such as farming and other operations can lead to increased erosion, which can result in changes to sediment composition and higher deposition rates in specific locations. Moreover, manmade artifacts like litter and debris can accumulate in marine environments due to discarding them from boats or being carried by rivers and creeks. These artifacts are termed technofossils when preserved in stratigraphy. Additionally, changes in biodiversity and species introductions, like the domestic chicken, can be identified in the fossil record and are associated with human impact, which also contributes to the presence of technofossils. Considering all these factors, Site A would likely experience a higher accumulation of litter and debris compared to Site B, due to the presence of technofossils and the associated human activities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about tony modra can be extracted from the following bio?

Rationale: Storks feed on a number of reptiles, amphibians, and ammals, and insects. The golden toad is an amphibian. The golden toad is a rare animal that has not been seen since 1989. The question and answer:","output":"Question: What could be the possible impacts of the disappearance of the golden toad on the diet and ecosystem dynamics involving storks? Answer: The disappearance of the golden toad could have several impacts on storks and the overall ecosystem dynamics. Since storks feed on a variety of animals, including amphibians like the golden toad, losing this food source may lead to a decrease in the availability of prey for storks to consume. This can potentially cause negative consequences for their population dynamics, as well as increase competition for other food sources among storks and with other predators. Additionally, the disappearance of the golden toad might indicate broader changes in the ecosystem. As with other species, the golden toad played a specific role within its environment, such as being a predator of insects and a prey for larger animals. The loss of the golden toad may have cascading effects on other species, potentially leading to imbalances within the ecosystem. Further, it could act as a warning sign for the health of the ecosystem as a whole, as the disappearance of species can often be indicative of larger issues like habitat loss or climate change."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Abesim is a town in Sunyani Municipal District in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana.

Which person learned less about protozoa that graze on algae? Answer:","output":"Answer: In this scenario, Brad learned less about protozoa that graze on algae than Reed. Reed started studying protozoa and developed an interest in their predatory behaviors. Although his primary focus was on predatory protozoa, it is likely that he also learned about other types of protozoa in the process of studying their predatorial habits. As he explored the various predatorial behaviors, he would come across protozoa that graze on algae as well, since many predatory protozoa also consume algae as part of their diet, rendering his learning more diversified than initially thought. On the other hand, Brad is more interested in learning about other types of protozoa, such as grazers and decomposers. While it is true that protozoa falling under these categories might also consume algae, Brad's focus is divided among various types of protozoa, including both grazers and decomposers, not specifically on those that graze on algae. Consequently, his learning is distributed across a wider variety of protozoa, instead of concentrating solely on those that eat algae. Therefore, though both Reed and Brad learn about protozoa that graze on algae, Brad learns less about them compared to Reed. Reed's focus on predatorial behaviors inadvertently leads him to gather more knowledge about the specified group of interest - protozoa that graze on algae - while Brad's wider, more general scope across grazers and decomposers dilutes his learning about the algae-grazing protozoa."},{"instruction":"Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Pick from: a). negative. b). positive.).","output":"I will write a negative movie review for this task. a) Movie Review: \\"Fiasco Force\\" (2021) \\"Fiasco Force\\" is a prime example of how excessive ambition can result in an overwhelming and disorienting cinematic experience. Directed by Stanley Brinks, this film attempts to juggle multiple genres, leaving viewers longing for coherence and an emotional connection. Step 1: Establish the negative tone To write a negative review, I will first establish a critical and disappointed tone. This will set the stage for my evaluation of the film's weak points. Step 2: Briefly summarize the plot In \\"Fiasco Force,\\" a group of misfit superheroes join forces to save the world from interdimensional chaos. Along the way, they uncover dark secrets from their pasts and learn to embrace their unique abilities. Step 3: Criticize film elements One of the film's most prominent issues is its convoluted narrative structure, which attempts to blend elements of action, sci-fi, comedy, and drama. As a result, \\"Fiasco Force\\" struggles to establish a singular identity, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected from the overall experience. Step 4: Discuss character development (or lack thereof) The character development suffers from the film's identity crisis. With a bloated cast that leaves little room for anyone to grow, the characters' story arcs feel rushed and underdeveloped. The screenplay fails to provide emotional depth or relatability, making it difficult to invest in the heroes' journeys. Step 5: Address technical aspects While the film boasts an impressive budget, the visual effects are inconsistent and often distracting. The action sequences come across as chaotic and unpolished, with several noticeable continuity errors and awkward CGI. The sound design also leaves much to be desired, overwhelming key moments with excessive noise. Step 6: Convey disappointment In an era where superhero films continue to dominate the box office, \\"Fiasco Force\\" had the potential to stand out with its distinct premise. Unfortunately, the film's lack of focus and direction results in a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying experience. Step 7: Provide a final rating With its convoluted narrative, underdeveloped characters, and disjointed visual effects, \\"Fiasco Force\\" earns a disappointing 2 out of 5 stars. In conclusion, \\"Fiasco Force\\" is an ambitious yet disappointing take on the superhero genre that fails to engage its audience.

In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity.

Would \\"The traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification , social class , culture , race and ethnicity , gender and sexuality , social mobility , religion , secularization , law , and deviance .\\" be a reasonable answer? Available options: [A]. No [B]. Yes Answer:","output":"A. While the statement provided does give an overview of the various traditional focuses of sociology, it does not fully address the question of how sociology is different from thinking. Let me provide you with a detailed and long answer that discusses the differences between the two. Sociology is the systematic and scientific study of human social behavior, interactions, networks, and institutions. It encompasses the analysis of social structures, processes, and patterns to understand how societies function and change over time. Sociologists utilize various research methods to collect data, analyze it, and develop theories or explanations about social phenomena. On the other hand, thinking refers to the cognitive processes that humans engage in to understand, interpret, and make decisions about the world around them. Thinking involves various mental operations such as recalling memories, creating mental images, making associations, and solving problems. It is a vital component of human cognition, allowing us to reflect on past experiences, evaluate situations, and plan for the future. Now that we have identified the main aspects of sociology and thinking, let's discuss how they differ from each other: 1. Discipline vs. Cognitive process: Sociology is an academic discipline that deals with the systematic study of human society and social behavior. In contrast, thinking is a cognitive process that forms a fundamental component of human intelligence and consciousness. 2. Scope: Sociology has a specific focus on examining human societies, their structures, and patterns of behavior. It looks at the collective behaviors of individuals, groups, and institutions in various social settings and contexts. Thinking, however, is a broad cognitive process that applies to various aspects of human experience, not just limited to social phenomena. 3. Research methodology: As a scientific discipline, sociology employs various research methods (such as surveys, interviews, participant observation, and experiments) to collect and analyze data on social phenomena. Thinking does not involve such standardized research methods as it occurs continuously in the human mind and is influenced by individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. 4. Goals and contributions: The primary goals of sociology are to understand society and social behavior, develop theories and explanations about social phenomena, and use this knowledge to address social issues or inform policy-making. In contrast, thinking allows individuals to understand, evaluate, and make decisions about their environment, experiences, and relationships on a personal level. 5. Social dimension: Sociology deals with the social aspects of human life, exploring the dynamics of human interactions, relationships, institutions, and communities. Thinking, while influenced by societal factors, fundamentally occurs within the individual's mind and involves various cognitive processes that apply to different areas of human experience. Therefore, the statement about the traditional focuses of sociology is interesting and informative, but it does not directly address the question about the differences between sociology and thinking. The above detailed explanation provides an overview of those differences to provide a comprehensive understanding of the core question."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Itcanbebeneficialtogamersbutalsoifyoudopresentations,videochatsorrecordingsofyourdesktop.","output":"It can be beneficial to gamers but also if you do presentations, video chats or recordings of your desktop."},{"instruction":"Question: what are web related servers? Would \\"Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website, here four Sun Fire X4200 servers are installed together\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Web-related servers are computer systems specifically designed to provide various services related to the World Wide Web. These servers often run software programs that listen to incoming requests and provide responses over the internet. Some common types of web-related servers include web servers, application servers, and database servers. Let's take a closer look at each of these server types: 1. Web servers: These servers host websites and serve web pages to users over the internet. They are responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests (from clients such as browsers) and returning the requested content in the form of an HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file. Some popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS. 2. Application servers: These servers host web applications and contain the business logic, which processes incoming requests from clients and provides the necessary data to the front-end. They serve as a bridge between web servers and back-end databases. Application servers handle tasks such as session management, security, and integration with other systems. Some common application servers are Tomcat, WebLogic, and JBoss. 3. Database servers: These servers store, manage, and provide access to the data required by web applications.

Sam got much larger","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Sam got much larger. We are told that Sam was initially too small for his college wrestling team, and his coach gave him a few months to bulk up. Despite trying different methods to gain mass, it appears that Sam's efforts to increase his size were unsuccessful. The fact that he was not allowed on the team could be an indication that he did not gain enough mass to meet the coach's requirements. It is important to note that various factors can influence an individual's ability to gain mass, such as genetics, diet, workout routines, and recovery. Sam may have faced challenges in one or more of these areas that prevented him from achieving significant gains in size. Additionally, it is essential to consider that the time frame given by the coach might not have been sufficient for Sam to make considerable progress in muscle growth, especially if he was inexperienced in weight training or had a naturally slim build. While we don't have enough information to determine whether Sam made any improvements at all, the fact that he was not allowed on the team implies that any growth he might have experienced was not sufficient to meet the team's criteria.

Prospect named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals . - The Center for Bits and Atoms was established in 2001 in the MIT Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is currently run by Neil Gershenfeld. This cross-disciplinary center broadly looks at the intersection of information to its physical representation. - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curriculae. A politician, he had served as state senator in New York. He was later appointed as a US diplomat to Germany and Russia, among other responsibilities. - Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis. This is distinct from nanoscale materials. Based on Richard Feynman's vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or \\"molecular manufacturing\\") would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by molecular machine systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies, and the molecular machinery of life with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories. - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807 December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator. - Swarthmore College (locally, or ), is a highly selective, leading private liberal arts college located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, southwest of Philadelphia. - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A quantum Turing machine (QTM), also a universal quantum computer, is an abstract machine used to model the effect of a quantum computer. It provides a very simple model which captures all of the power of quantum computation. Any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine. Such Turing machines were first proposed in a 1985 article written by Oxford University physicist David Deutsch suggesting quantum gates could function in a similar fashion to traditional digital computing binary logic gates. - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - David Elieser Deutsch, FRS (born 18 May 1953), is an Israeli-born British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. - Ithaca is a city in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York. It is the seat of Tompkins County, as well as the largest community in the Ithaca-Tompkins County metropolitan area. This area contains the municipalities of the Town of Ithaca, the village of Cayuga Heights, and other towns and villages in Tompkins County. The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake, in Central New York. It is named for the Greek island of Ithaca. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devoted to projects at the convergence of technology, multimedia, sciences, art and design. Staff and students have backgrounds ranging from electrical engineering and computer science to sociology and music and others. The Media Lab has been widely popularized since the 1990s by business and technology publications such as \\"Wired\\" and \\"Red Herring\\" for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. , it has diversified its research into neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments. The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was one of the notable research efforts which grew out of the Media Lab. - Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. As also confirmed by various measurement standards, which include the \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" impact factor and the journal h-index proposed by Google Scholar, many physicists and other scientists consider \\"Physical Review Letters\\" one of the most prestigious journals in the field of physics. - The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious \\"Physical Review\\" and \\"Physical Review Letters\\", and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian.

He was 69. Mr. Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical officials quoted by Agence France-Presse. Among the Arab autocrats who became stock players in the perpetual drama of negotiating Middle East peace, none was more courted, nor more aloof, than the Syrian leader. No lasting peace could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive largely due to his stubborn role in demanding back every inch of Syrian territory. At home, Mr. Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, limiting access to modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow become tools to help undermine his government. Mr. Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major holidays. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas that faced each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus. The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to keep the latest peace effort from foundering there, emerged with a grudging respect for Mr. Assad. He was at once courteous and calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The length of the sessions were as legendary as they were nerve-racking. When Henry A. Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first American secretary of state to visit Syria in 20 years, their initial meeting lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes. The waiting press, uninitiated in the ways of the Syrian leader, wondered aloud if the American had been kidnapped. ''His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear,'' Mr. Kissinger wrote in ''Years of Upheaval,'' the volume of his memoirs published in 1982. ''He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the Israelis, much as both of them would hate the comparison.)'' The lengthy exchanges got to the point that one task of the American ambassador was to brief visiting dignitaries before any meeting with President Assad to pace themselves on the constant offerings of coffee, tea and lemonade lest they bruise protocol by interrupting the Syrian leader to ask for a bathroom break. ''We dubbed it bladder diplomacy,'' said Edward P. Djerejian, the American ambassador from 1988 to 1991. Mr. Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in 1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present circumstances temporary. ''Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive great patience from his obvious sense of history,'' President Jimmy Carter wrote in ''The Blood of Abraham,'' a 1985 study of the region. Syria was a young nation adrift before Mr. Assad's rule. The government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little development and a population weary of chaos. Summary:","output":"Hafez al-Assad was a leader in Syria who was in charge for 30 years. He worked hard to make Syria a strong and powerful country. He didn't like Israel and didn't want to make peace with them. Mr. Assad didn't let people disagree with him and controlled everything. He lived a simple life and worked very long hours. Many important people from other countries met with Mr. Assad, but it was difficult to make deals with him. He passed away at the age of 69 because of a heart attack."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a text passage as input comprising of dialogue of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, your task is to classify the item being sold into exactly one of these categories: 'housing', 'furniture', 'bike', 'phone', 'car', 'electronics'.

Richard Becher, 50, was on the mound during batting practice at a facility called at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, Suffolk County, when a 12-year-old batter smacked a ball right up the middle that plunked him in the head and knocked him unconscious, according to officials. “He was an amazing person, an amazing father, son, friend,” family friend Denise Volpicello told The Post. “It’s devastating for everyone. He was very active in the community. It’s a tremendous loss.” The young player hit the ball that struck Becher sometime around 5:30 p.m., authorities said. Becher’s brother-in-law said the devoted baseball dad — whose son played on the team he coached — was struck hard by a line drive. “He threw a pitch, the ball got hit. It was a line drive,” John Bree, 51, told Newsday. “He was hit in the head. He dropped to the ground.” Several bystanders attempted to revive the unconscious Becher with CPR while waiting for police and EMS to arrive. Becher, who lived in nearby Holbrook, was rushed to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue, where he was declared dead, police said. “It was obviously a tragic situation,” said Roger Pondel, a spokesman for Baseball Heaven. “Our hearts go out to the family.” Becher, a married father of two, was reportedly pitching from behind an L-screen, which is designed to protect players from this sort of injury, when he was struck. Michael Rubenstein, the president of Sachem Little League, said it was a freak accident. “It’s pretty rare [to get hit] if you’re behind the screen, but you can stick your head out for a second” and expose yourself, Rubenstein told Newsday. The team was preparing for a Tri-State Tournament game Saturday night. The game was canceled after the tragic incident. Becher was a board member of Sachem and the Ronkonkoma Youth Organization. His friends on Long Island were heartbroken by his death and mourned him on social media. “The Sachem community lost a great man last night,” Christopher Pierre wrote on Facebook. “Rich was always the life of the party, had the ability to make you laugh.” Pierre added that Becher was a constant presence on the field and was respected throughout the community. “His tragic passing was where Rich was usually found, on a baseball field with his son and his team,” he said. “His untimely passing is a constant reminder how in a split second, life is altered. It’s hard for me to believe this isn’t a nightmare.” Another friend remembered Becher for his enthusiasm for the game. “Always full of energy when he came into the academy,” Tom Downey wrote on Facebook. “Always reminded the kids that they were suppose to have fun. I’ll always remember that about him.” Becher was the owner of Bech Air Corp., a sheet-metal-installation company on Long Island. ||||| A devoted Holbrook father described as a passionate backer of youth sports died after being hit in the head by a baseball while pitching batting practice to his 12-year-old son's team, his family and Suffolk police said.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What do monarch butterfly larvae depend on for their food? A: A:","output":"The monarch butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, primarily depend on milkweeds (answer option 4) for their food. Milkweed plants, belonging to the genus Asclepias, are native to North America and play a crucial role in the survival and life cycle of monarch butterflies. Milkweeds contain essential nutrients and chemical compounds that not only fulfill the dietary requirements of the monarch butterfly larvae but also contribute to their overall survival strategy. Here are some reasons why milkweeds are fundamental to monarch butterfly larval anatomy and physiology: 1. Rich source of nutrition: Milkweed leaves provide the necessary nutrients for the growth and development of the larval stage of monarch butterflies. As the caterpillar feeds on the leaves, it grows rapidly and undergoes a series of molts, advancing from one instar to another until reaching the pupal stage. 2. Cardenolides: Milkweeds contain a group of defensive toxins known as cardenolides. Monarch butterfly larvae have the ability to tolerate these toxins and accumulate them in their bodies. This makes the caterpillars unpalatable to most predators, providing a crucial deterrence strategy in their defense mechanism. 3. Symbiotic relationship: The relationship between monarch butterfly larvae and milkweed plants is an excellent example of a mutualistic interaction. Monarch butterflies aid in the pollination of milkweed plants, which, in return, offer a suitable and exclusive food source for their offspring. 4. Coloration and warning system: The accumulation of cardenolides is correlated with the bright and striking coloration of monarch larvae. These bright colors act as a warning system to potential predators, signalling that they are toxic and undesirable, ensuring the survival of the larvae. 5. Host plant specificity: Monarch butterflies will only lay their eggs on milkweed plants, ensuring the survival of their progeny from the very beginning. This selectiveness in host-plant choice guarantees that the future caterpillars will have access to the most appropriate nourishment for their development. In conclusion, milkweeds play an indispensable role in the life of monarch butterfly larvae. The reliance on milkweeds for sustenance, protection, and proper development highlights the significance of these plants and their preservation in supporting and sustaining monarch butterfly populations."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Aim to have at least 25 to 35 grams (0.88 to 1.23 oz) of fiber a day to keep your glycemic index down, as this can then prevent a rise in your blood sugar levels. Have a fist-sized portion of high-fiber foods at each meal. Try high-fiber foods like whole grains, legumes, and nuts. Add fruits that are high in fiber, like raspberries, pears, apples, bananas, and strawberries to your diet. Vegetables like artichokes, split peas, broccoli, potatoes, turnips, and Brussels sprouts are also high in fiber. Beans like lentils, lima beans, and black beans, as well as nuts, like almonds, pistachios, and pecans, are also good sources of fiber. Foods made of processed grains can cause a rapid increase in your blood sugar and insulin levels, making your type 2 diabetes worse. Stay away from white bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes. You should also avoid foods high in processed sugars, such as cakes, candy, and baked goods. Do not consume soda, energy drinks, or bottled juice, as they can be high in sugar.

Although there's conflicting evidence, beef, pork, and chicken may cause your blood sugar to spike. Try to have less meat in your meals or skip meat altogether for 1-2 of your meals each day. Replace meat with foods that are high in fiber and healthy fats. You can also try having soy products like tofu instead of meat in your meals. Consider switching to lean meat or mostly high-fiber plant-based diet over time. Start gradually by replacing meat in some of your meals with vegetables, plant-based protein, or grains. Over time, you can try reducing your meat consumption to a few times a week or to just once a week. A plant-based diet is also a good way to monitor your weight and stay healthy so your diabetes does not get worse. If you do go with a plant-based diet, you'll need to keep track of your B-12 and fat intake to avoid a deficiency. If you are not sure how to best adjust your diet to treat type 2 diabetes, ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian. They can then create a custom diet for you based on your eating habits and preferences. They can also recommend certain meals so you get enough fiber, carbohydrates, and protein in your diet. Many registered dietitians are trained in treating diabetes through diet. They should be able to provide you with lots of resources and support. Keep in mind you cannot treat diabetes with diet changes alone.

It is important to understand the meaning of each word and how they relate to the scenario described to determine which word best represents Joe's feelings about taking phone calls during lunch. Let's consider each option in relation to the scenario: 1. Decisions - This word implies that Joe would be making choices when faced with taking phone calls during lunch. However, this doesn't necessarily provide any insight into how he feels about the act itself, which is what we're trying to determine. 2. Delight - This word suggests pleasure or enjoyment. If Joe delighted in taking phone calls during lunch, it would imply that he enjoys the interruption. However, the question clearly states that Joe \\"hated\\" taking phone calls during lunch, making \\"delight\\" an inappropriate choice. 3. Communication - This word refers to the process of exchanging information. While it accurately describes the act of taking phone calls, it fails to convey Joe's emotions about the interruption, which is the crux of the question. 4. Regret - This word implies a sense of sadness or remorse. If Joe felt regret when taking phone calls during lunch, it would indicate that he might feel guilty or sorry for doing so. Although this is possible, the scenario suggests that his primary emotion is not sadness or remorse but rather annoyance, as he \\"hated\\" the interruption. 5.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. When more wind and rain occur, it can increase the rate of erosion and the movement of sediment. This can result in more sediment being loosened from the soil and being carried down towards rivers. The increased water flow from the rain can also help transport the sediment more efficiently, potentially leading to a change in how the lighter and heavier items are distributed within the river. Though the wind and rain do not directly change the steps of the sediment transportation process as described, they can indirectly impact the process by altering the amount of sediment being transported and the rate at which it moves. This may affect how lighter items float to the top or get suspended in the water and subsequently the distribution of these items in lakes and oceans."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want","output":"Step 1: Choose a topic and setting for the dialogue.

At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"Auto and electrical industry demand for rubber, which dramatically increased during World War I\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Options are: (1). no. (2). yes.","output":"2. yes The answer is correct because the Malay ruling class took a back seat as the British gained control of the rubber and tin industries, which were the main sources of income for Malay. The growth of the motor-car and electrical industries increased the demand for rubber, which then sky-rocketed during World War I. This allowed the British to firmly hold the reins of government, leaving the Malay ruling class to focus on local and religious affairs."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"A movie review is when someone watches a movie and then shares their thoughts about it.

Question: suppose there is less sunlight gathered by leaves happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less To better understand the answer, let's go through each step of the process and analyze the potential consequences of reduced sunlight on the production of sugar and oxygen in plants. 1. Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily: Chlorophyll, the green pigment in the leaves, captures sunlight and starts the process of photosynthesis. 2. Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant: Leaves serve as light-collecting organs, with a large surface area exposed to sunlight to maximize absorption. 3. The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a vital process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight energy, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The sunlight energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to drive a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. 4. The glucose travels the plant: Once produced, glucose is transported throughout the plant via phloem tissue, providing energy and raw materials for growth and reproduction. 5. The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow: Glucose is broken down through cellular respiration, releasing energy that plants can use for various life processes, including growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Now, let's get back to the question. Suppose there is less sunlight gathered by leaves. This would mean that the plants would have less energy input available for the photosynthesis process. With less sunlight energy, the rate of photosynthesis would decrease, resulting in reduced production of glucose and oxygen. So, in this scenario, the correct answer would be B: less. As the availability of sunlight decreases, less sugar (glucose) and oxygen will be produced by the plant through photosynthesis. This may lead to slower overall growth, reduced reproduction, and potentially weaker plants more susceptible to diseases and pests. Additionally, less oxygen production by plants can have implications for other organisms in the ecosystem, as many living beings rely on oxygen for survival."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - A remake is a film or television series that is based on an earlier work and tells the same story. - Self-defense (self-defence in many varieties of English) is a countermeasure that involves defending the health and well-being of oneself from harm.

Founding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan. After formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year.

The kids tried to catch the snake, but not the rabbit because the OPTIONS: -snake is more interesting.. -rabbit is more interesting..","output":"The kids tried to catch the snake, but not the rabbit because the snake is more interesting. Fascinated by its slithering movements and unique appearance, the children gathered around it in awe. They were mesmerized by the way the snake seemed to effortlessly glide through the grass, as if it was somehow gliding on an invisible wave. Its scales shimmered in the sunlight, reflecting an array of colors that changed depending on the angle from which they were observed. In contrast, the rabbit, though cute and fluffy, simply could not compete with the exotic allure of the snake. As the children slowly approached the snake, they whispered among themselves, discussing their plans for capturing it. Some suggested using sticks to prevent the snake from escaping, while others proposed creating a makeshift trap with rocks and branches. It was evident that their curiosity had transformed into a full-blown quest for this intriguing creature. Understanding the potential danger that a snake might pose, the older children took charge, instructing the younger ones to maintain a safe distance. They had heard stories about venomous snakes from their elders and did not want to expose themselves or their friends to any unnecessary risks. Despite their awareness of the potential threat, their youthful excitement and fascination with the snake still drove them forward. Working together, the kids implemented their capture plan almost like a choreographed dance. Several of them gently pinned the snake using sticks, being careful not to injure the serpent. Another group began constructing a makeshift trap with rocks, branches, and tall grass, creating an enclosure that would prevent the snake from escaping. Once the snake was sufficiently secured, they all stepped back and marveled at their accomplishment. With the snake safely contained, the children began to discuss what they would do next. Some wanted to bring the creature back to their village to show their families and friends, while others argued that it would be best to release the snake back into the wild. In the midst of their heated debate, several children couldn't help but glance over at the rabbit, which was still calmly nibbling on some grass a few feet away. Although they acknowledged the rabbit's appeal, it was evident that the snake had captured their collective imagination like nothing else could. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, the children ultimately made the wise decision to release the snake back into its natural habitat. They carefully removed the sticks that pinned it down, and watched in amazement as the snake quickly slithered away, disappearing into the tall grass. Satisfied with their thrilling adventure, the kids headed home, their minds brimming with stories to share with their families about the snake and their incredible teamwork. As they walked away, a newfound respect for nature and its fascinating creatures settled within their hearts. While they didn't catch the rabbit that day, their experience with the snake only deepened their curiosity and desire to explore the world around them. Unbeknownst to them, this simple encounter would go on to inspire many more expeditions and discoveries in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Image copyright AFP Image caption The kidnapping of the schoolgirls from Chibok has outraged the international community Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has called off a visit the town where more than 200 schoolgirls were abducted, officials say. Sources had told the BBC he would stop in Chibok, in the north-east, on his way to a conference in France on the threat from Boko Haram militants. But the visit was called off for security reasons, the officials said. The president - under pressure over his government's failure to rescue the girls - will fly direct to Paris. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nigeria says the cancellation of this visit underlines just how fragile the security situation is in the north-east. On Thursday, relatives of the girls called for their unconditional release by Boko Haram. Mr Jonathan is said to have ruled out negotiations over a possible release of prisoners. Nothing was seen of the girls for almost a month after they were taken from Chibok. But on Monday the group released a video showing more than 100 of them and offering an exchange for prisoners. UK Africa Minister Mark Simmonds said Mr Jonathan had \\"made it very clear that there will be no negotiation\\" at a meeting on Wednesday. Image copyright AP Image caption A video emerged on Monday showing about 130 of the girls wearing hijabs and reciting Koranic verses President Jonathan has been criticised for not visiting the town - more than a month after the girls were seized. The president will travel to Paris to take part in a summit convened by French President Francois Hollande to discuss Boko Haram. The leaders of Nigeria's neighbours - Benin, Cameroon, Niger and Chad - are scheduled to attend the summit on Saturday, which will also include representatives from the UK, US and EU. A statement said delegates at the meeting will \\"discuss fresh strategies for dealing with the security threat posed by Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in west and Central Africa\\". 'Troubling atrocities' Meanwhile, US officials on Thursday criticised the speed of Nigeria's response to the threat from Boko Haram. Alice Friend, director for African affairs at the US defence department, said its security forces had been \\"slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Simpson assesses the threat of Boko Haram She also said the US was unable to offer aid to Nigeria's military because of \\"troubling\\" atrocities perpetrated by some units during operations against Boko Haram. \\"We cannot ignore that Nigeria can be an extremely challenging partner to work with,\\" Ms Friend said. State of emergency US drones and surveillance aircraft have been deployed to assist in the search for the schoolgirls, while the UK has sent a military team to the capital, Abuja, to work alongside US, French and Israeli experts. The lower house of Nigeria's parliament, the House of Representatives, approved an extension of the state of emergency in the north-east states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa on Thursday.

The state of emergency, which still needs to be approved by the Senate, gives the military widespread powers such as detaining suspects, imposing curfews and setting up roadblocks. On Thursday, there were reports of fresh attacks by suspected Boko Haram militants in Borno state. A witness told the BBC's Hausa Service that there had been explosions in Gamboru Ngala, were some 300 people were killed last week in a massacre blamed on Boko Haram. ||||| ABUJA Nigeria's hunt for more than 200 abducted schoolgirls is not all that it seems. In public, an international operation is gathering pace while behind the scenes, officials say it is unlikely to deliver the success that global opinion demands. The United States and Britain are helping Nigerian forces in the effort to liberate the girls taken from their school in Borno state a month ago by Boko Haram Islamist militants. The pressure for results is huge, with the likes of Michelle Obama and film star Angelina Jolie supporting a social media campaign operating under the Twitter tag #BringBackOurGirls. Washington has sent surveillance aircraft as well as assigning medical, intelligence, counter-terrorism and communications advisers to the mission. But officials have little idea where the girls are, and acknowledge that if they are found, any rescue attempt would be fraught with problems. On top of that, morale is shaky among some of the Nigerian troops involved in the hunt who already have experience of Boko Haram as a formidable foe. \\"We commend the effort by the #BringBackOurGirls protesters but it doesn't fit with the reality of the security situation we are facing,\\" said a senior Nigerian military source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign experts are also pessimistic that the girls can be extricated from the rebels' clutches and returned to their homes in Nigeria's remote northeast where Boko Haram operates. \\"I think a rescue is currently unlikely and unfeasible,\\" said Jacob Zenn, a Boko Haram expert at U.S. counter-terrorism institution CTC Sentinel. Until Monday, nothing had been seen of the girls since they were snatched from the village of Chibok near Nigeria's borders with Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Then Boko Haram released a video showing more than 100 girls together in a rural location. In it, rebel leader Abubakar Shekau offered to exchange them for captured militants. The video raised hopes that their location could be found using ground forces, state-of-the-art intelligence and surveillance planes. Then an operation could be staged, perhaps with forces swooping from the sky like a British raid in Sierra Leone in 2000 to free soldiers held by militiamen, or Israeli commandoes' rescue of passengers from a jet hijacked to Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. However, such a scenario is unlikely this time. One source with knowledge of the search said the footage was probably taken at least 10 days ago, if Boko Harma's past videos are any guide. By now, the girls could be somewhere else as a group, or dispersed to many places. VIRTUALLY UNDETECTABLE The Sambisa forest, Boko Haram's stronghold, is a first target but it is not conducive to aerial search because it covers 60,000 square km (23,000 square miles), more than twice the size of Rwanda. The rebels know this area intimately and could spread the girls among local families, making them virtually undetectable by conventional security forces. Two U.S. national security sources said initially the girls were separated into around three large groups but were subsequently scattered in smaller groups. Other experts said they could be in mountains near Gwoza on the Cameroon border. If this is the case, some girls might be found before others, posing a dilemma for would-be rescuers. \\"In the past, Boko have threatened, and maybe actually gone ahead with, killing hostages upon sensing the merest hint of possible rescue operations,\\" said a security source. Rescuing some girls could add to danger faced by others still captive. Another problem is time. Britain's minister responsible for African affairs, Mark Simmonds, said on Wednesday that it was \\"early days\\" in the rescue operation, yet the abduction happened on April 14 so rebels have had ample time to prepare for an international response. A senior U.S. Defense Department official criticized Nigeria on Thursday for being too slow to adapt to the threat of Boko Haram. TIRED OF FIGHTING An incident this week highlighted the problems of the Nigerian army, whose 1st and 7th divisions have been deployed to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, to confront the rebels. On Tuesday, gunmen ambushed a unit returning to Maiduguri from Chibok, killing at least four soldiers. Rebels were also killed. The next day soldiers fired into the air at Maiduguri barracks to protest about what they said was poor leadership. Defense headquarters quickly stated that the situation had been resolved, but soldiers told Reuters they remained angry. \\"These Boko Haram have special forces. They know how to shoot and maintain their grounds more than us. What is making it worse is our superior officers who are insensitive to the plight of the troops,\\" said a soldier, who declined to be identified. \\"We are tired of this whole thing because we are being killed every day and we don't get the required support and care from our superiors,\\" another soldier said. President Goodluck Jonathan will visit Chibok on Friday, senior government officials said. Even coordinating an international effort faces difficulties in Nigeria, which recently overtook South Africa as the continent's biggest economy. Nigeria has close ties with Western powers but has historically resisted foreign military involvement on its soil. One possible sign of differing approaches is that Simmonds, rather than the president himself, announced that Jonathan had ruled out any prisoner exchange for the girls' release. Nigerian officials have since declined to comment. Ultimately, the girls' best hope may lie in dialogue but the road to talks remains uncertain because the rebels do not form a unified group. Boko Haram is faceless and even Shekau heads just one of several loosely coordinated groups with differing objectives, said a senior official with knowledge of the northeast. A Nigerian presidential committee set up last year for talks with the rebels dealt last year with Boko Haram proxies. But they were later denounced by other Boko Haram militants as impostors, according to Minister of Special Duties Tanimu Turaki, who leads the committee. One security source in Abuja cautioned against raising false hopes. \\"It is time we removed the thought of a very happy ending to this situation,\\" the source said.

Islamic militants again attacked... (Associated Press) It would have been the first reported visit by the president to the scene of an attack in the northeastern region that has suffered for five years the increasingly deadly assaults by Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram terrorist network. Jonathan, a Christian from the south, has been accused of insensitivity to the plight of the mainly Muslim northerners. Thousands have been killed over the years and more than 1,500 civilians have died in the insurgency this year alone. Two officials in the presidency confirmed the cancellation saying there were apparent concerns about security after news of the planned trip was leaked to the media and published on front pages of newspapers Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not supposed to give information to reporters. Jonathan had been expected to fly on one of his presidential jets from Abuja, the capital in central Nigeria, to Maiduguri, the Borno state capital in the northeast, and then be transported by military helicopter to the town of Chibok, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the south. The road from Maiduguri to Chibok passes by the Sambisa Forest to which the girls first were taken that is a known hideout of the insurgents and has been attacked many times. Soldiers say 12 troops were killed in an ambush on that road on Monday night. The Defense Ministry said four soldiers were killed in a firefight on the outskirts of Chibok that night. Soldiers revolted and opened fire on the car of a commanding officer who came to pay respects to the bodies brought to a Maiduguri barracks on Tuesday, said the soldiers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they want to keep their jobs. The Defense Ministry said the soldiers only fired into the air. The commander was unharmed. There have been other signs that some Nigerian troops are near mutiny, complaining that they are outnumbered and outgunned by the insurgents, are not properly paid and have to scavenge for food in the bush. The weakness of the Nigerian military was described Thursday by Alice Friend, the U.S. Department for Defense director for African affairs at a hearing about the kidnapped girls and the threat posed by Boko Haram. \\"And so we're now looking at a military force that's, quite frankly, becoming afraid to even engage\\" the enemy, she told the U.S. Senate subcommittee on African Affairs in Washington.

Imagine if you have -1390221 apples on one side (*y means multiplying by y) and on the other side you have -1390293 apples also multiplied by y, and you are given 1512 more apples. We need to find out how many apples one y is equal to. So, let's solve this together! First, let's move -1390293*y to the left side of the equation. To do that, we can add 1390293*y to both sides. Then our equation will look like this: -1390221*y + 1390293*y = 1512 Now, let's combine the number of apples on the left side. (-1390221 + 1390293)*y = 1512 When we add the numbers in the parentheses together, we get 72. So, now our equation is: 72*y = 1512 To find out one y, we need to divide 1512 by 72. Like you divide a big number of candies among your friends to find out how many candies each friend gets. 1512 ÷ 72 = 21 So, the answer is y = 21.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What do cells have multiple repair mechanisms to repair?\\" with the following options: - Veins and arteries. - damage to DNA - a cuticle - animals - mammals - peachleaf willow - gastropod shells - an organism's body Answer:","output":"Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to repair damage to DNA. These repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining the stability, integrity, and health of an organism's genetic material. Damage to DNA, also known as mutations, can occur due to various factors such as replication errors, environmental agents like radiation or chemicals, and spontaneous chemical changes. DNA repair mechanisms work to detect damaged DNA and initiate the repair process. There are several repair mechanisms in place to address different types of DNA damage. Some of these include: 1. Base excision repair (BER): This mechanism identifies and removes damaged or incorrect bases in the DNA. Enzymes called DNA glycosylases recognize and remove the damaged base, followed by other enzymes that fill in the gap with the correct base. 2. Nucleotide excision repair (NER): This mechanism removes larger DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation. NER enzymes recognize and remove the damaged section of DNA and fill in the gap with the correct nucleotides. 3. Mismatch repair (MMR): MMR enzymes recognize and repair errors that occur during DNA replication, such as mismatches or small insertions or deletions. This mechanism helps to maintain the fidelity of an organism's genetic information. 4. Double-strand break repair: Double-strand breaks in DNA can be caused by ionizing radiation, chemicals, or replication errors. Two primary pathways exist to repair these breaks: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR uses the sister chromatid as a template to repair the break, while NHEJ directly ligates the broken ends together. 5. Direct reversal of damage: Some DNA damage can be directly reversed by specific enzymes, such as photolyases, which recognize and repair UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. These multiple repair mechanisms ensure that cells can effectively repair a wide range of DNA damage and maintain the integrity of their genetic information. It is crucial for overall cellular health and proper functioning as unaddressed DNA damage can lead to cell death or the development of diseases such as cancer."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

While Prague had big air pollution problems, Belfast was eco-friendly and its inhabitants were healthy. But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. What is an answer for this question: Which city had more people with an increased chance of dying from other diseases?","output":"Based on the given background information, the city with more people having an increased chance of dying from other diseases due to air pollution would be Prague. The reason behind this conclusion lies in the differences in air quality between Prague and Belfast, as presented in the situation. Since Prague is facing significant air pollution problems, its residents are exposed to harmful air pollutants. In consequence, these pollutants can lead to the development of lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer and increase the risk of dying from other diseases. On the contrary, Belfast is described as an eco-friendly city with healthier inhabitants. This implies that the air quality in Belfast is much better than in Prague, and the risks associated with air pollution are substantially lower. The residents of Belfast would, therefore, have a reduced chance of dying from other diseases that are linked to air pollution exposure. It is essential to note that the effects of air pollution can be particularly detrimental to vulnerable populations such as children, who are in the process of developing and growing their lungs, and consume more air relative to their size compared to adults. Consequently, they are more susceptible to the harmful impacts of poor air quality. Furthermore, the environmental consequences of air pollution also differ depending on the specific pollutants present; these pollutants can damage both the environment and the health of living organisms, aggravating the overall situation in affected areas like Prague. In conclusion, considering the air quality conditions in the two sister cities, Prague has a higher number of people at an increased chance of dying from other diseases due to air pollution when compared to Belfast, which has a more environmentally-friendly and healthier atmosphere for its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A small child is yawning while hoisted on the back of a man.\\" is it true that \\"The child is sitting on the man's back.\\"?.

Neutrals include colors like navy, olive, gold, silver, cream, and camel. Neutrals tend to go with anything. If you don't want a look that's completely lacking in color, you can use neutrals to bring out your eyes while still having some bright colors in your outfit. For example, if you want to wear a pink top, wear it with olive green jeans. Corals tend to bring out green eyes during the day. Corals contrast with green just slightly to make your eyes really pop. Look for coral wardrobe items to highlight green eyes during the day. For example, look for coral dresses, undershirts, blazers, or pants to bring out your green eyes during the day. While hazel eyes do tend to pair well with darker colors, during the day you should go lighter. Lavender can really bring out your hazel eyes for daytime wear. If lavender is too soft or feminine for your tastes, you can incorporate it in small ways. For example, wear a lavender undershirt with a suit. Deep blues work great at bringing out brown eyes during the day. For daytime events, look for your best deep blue wardrobe items. For a more casual event, blue jeans can actually be a great way to bring out your brown eyes. For a more formal event, go for a dark blue button shirt, suit jacket, blazer, dress, or dress pants.

The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

Fake bank card PIN numbers. Fictitious email accounts. Wells Fargo admitted to firing 5,300 employees for engaging in these shocking tactics. The bank earlier this month paid 185 million in penalties and has since apologized. Now CNNMoney is hearing from former Wells Fargo (WFC) workers around the country who tried to put a stop to these illegal tactics. Almost half a dozen workers who spoke with us say they paid dearly for trying to do the right thing: they were fired. \\"They ruined my life,\\" Bill Bado, a former Wells Fargo banker in Pennsylvania, told CNNMoney. Bado not only refused orders to open phony bank and credit accounts. The New Jersey man called an ethics hotline and sent an email to human resources in September 2013, flagging unethical sales activities he was being instructed to do. Eight days after that email, a copy of which CNNMoney obtained, Bado was terminated. The stated reason? Tardiness. Related: Elizabeth Warren's epic takedown of Wells Fargo CEO HR official describes 'retaliation' Retaliating against whistleblowers is a major breach of trust. Ethics hotlines are exactly the kind of safeguards put in place to prevent illegal activity from taking place and provide refuge to employees from dangerous work environments. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf made precisely that point on Tuesday when he testified before angry Senators. \\"Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,\\" Stumpf told lawmakers. He mentioned the anonymous ethics line, adding, \\"We want to hear from them.\\" But that's not the experience of some former Wells Fargo workers. One former Wells Fargo human resources official even said the bank had a method in place to retaliate against tipsters. He said that Wells Fargo would find ways to fire employees \\"in retaliation for shining light\\" on sales issues. It could be as simple as monitoring the employee to find a fault, like showing up a few minutes late on several occasions. \\"If this person was supposed to be at the branch at 8:30 a.m. and they showed up at 8:32 a.m, they would fire them,\\" the former human resources official told CNNMoney, on the condition he remain anonymous out of fear for his career. CNNMoney spoke to a total of four ex-Wells Fargo workers, including Bado, who believe they were fired because they tipped off the bank about unethical sales practices. Another six former Wells Fargo employees told CNNMoney they witnessed similar behavior at Wells Fargo -- even though the company has a policy in place that is supposed to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. CNNMoney has taken steps to confirm that the workers who spoke anonymously did work at Wells Fargo and in some cases interviewed colleagues who corroborated their reports. It's possible Wells Fargo could face legal consequences for any retaliation that occurred against employees who called the ethics line. \\"It is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,\\" Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the SEC, told CNNMoney in an email. A number of statutes -- including Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank -- \\"make this unambiguously clear,\\" Pitt said. \\"I endured harsh bullying ... defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something I didn't do,\\" said Heather Brock, who was fired earlier this month as a senior business banker at a Wells Fargo branch in Round Rock, Texas. Related: Workers tell Wells Fargo horror stories 'That's retaliation' One such former employee was fired after flagging issues directly to Stumpf, according to Senator Bob Menendez. At the Senate hearing, Menendez read the New Jersey woman's 2011 email to Stumpf, where she described improper sales tactics she felt were \\"wrong.\\" \\"Did you read that email?\\" Menendez asked Stumpf. \\"I don't remember that one,\\" Stumpf replied. \\"Okay, well she was fired. ... So much for the safe haven,\\" Menendez said. Several senators spoke about the plight of the mostly 5,300, low-level employees who were fired related to the scandal. The firing certainly took a huge toll on Bado's life. It put a permanent stain on his securities license, scaring off other prospective bank employers. Today, the New Jersey man's house is on the verge of being foreclosed on and he's working part-time, at Shop-Rite. \\"You wonder where the justice is,\\" Bado said. Ken Springer, a former FBI agent who runs a firm that offers a whistleblower hotline service, was alarmed by the allegations made by former Wells Fargo employees. \\"That's retaliation. It's a big problem -- and a perfect example of what shouldn't happen,\\" Springer said. \\"It looks like there's been a terrible breakdown of checks and balances at Wells Fargo.\\" In response to CNNMoney's report, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said: \\"We do not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns in good faith.\\" She emphasized that employees are encouraged to immediately report unethical behavior to their manager, HR representative or 24-hour ethics line. Related: Wells Fargo CEO denies orchestrated fraud 'Excessive tardiness' eight days after HR email Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that Bado had worked there. However, the bank declined to comment on why Bado left and and on the ethics complaint with corresponding report number he cited in emails. \\"Everything submitted to the EthicsLine is investigated,\\" a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said. While ethics complaints are supposed to be confidential, documents show that Bado did speak out before he was fired. On September 19, 2013, Bado wrote an email to a Wells Fargo HR rep and copied his regional manager, where he detailed improper sales tactics. Documents show Bado was fired -- for \\"excessive tardiness\\" -- just eight days later. \\"I have been asked on several occasions to do things that I know are not ethical and would be grounds for discharge,\\" Bado said in the email to HR. He said a branch manager on \\"many occasions\\" asked him to send out a debit card, \\"pin it,\\" and enroll customers in online banking -- \\"all without the customers (sic) request or knowledge.\\" Those are precisely the same practices that regulators fined Wells Fargo for three years later and that senators grilled the bank over this week. Lose, lose situation for Heather Brock Brock, the business banker from Texas, told CNNMoney she experienced a similar situation. The 26-year-old single parent of two young boys was fired soon after she contacted the company's ethics line about illegal sales practices she witnessed. Wells Fargo also confirmed Brock used to work at the company but declined to comment further. Brock was fired earlier this month, with Wells Fargo accusing her of falsifying documents -- a charge Brock emphatically denies. Brock said the company bullied her into admitting she did something wrong. A current Wells Fargo employee who works in Brock's branch vouched for her version of events. \\"That's really scary when you're with a big corporation like this and HR doesn't have your back,\\" said the current employee, who wished to remain anonymous so as not to get fired as well. Brock is hoping her story forces meaningful change at Wells Fargo. \\"You lose if you do complain and you lose if you don't. What does a powerless employee do?\\" Brock said. -- To reach the author of this article email Matt.Egan@cnn.com ||||| Wells Fargo’s former employees don’t agree with CEO John Stumpf’s assessment that they were the rotten apples. While still training at a California Wells Fargo in 2013, Khalid Taha, then a personal banker, was approached by a co-worker and pressed to open a second account under false pretenses. The co-worker told Taha that he couldn’t convert his existing Wells Fargo account into an employee account. She also told him he could buy credit card insurance with no fees. When Taha discovered later, during his ethics training that he had been lied to about both products, he reported the employee. It did not go as expected. “This employee was promoted after a few months,” he said during a press conference hosted by the Committee for Better Banks. See also: Goldman Sachs Bans Employees from Donating to Trump The Committee, which is an organization that says it represents the rights of workers in the financial service industry, brought together a handful of former bank employees on Monday, including two from Wells Fargo, in light of the banking giant’s recent scandal. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ordered Wells Fargo to pay 185 million in fines for opening 2 million phony accounts, saying the practice was a result of employees trying to hit aggressive sales targets and receive bonuses. Wells Fargo (wfc) CEO John Stumpf though, seems to have shifted blame for the scandal on to a few bad apples—the 5,300 employees fired (He clarified to CNBC that he did feel accountable, but maintained that nothing in Wells Fargo’s culture had promoted such behavior). See also: Inside Wall Street’s Greatest Feud: Icahn vs. Ackman Yet, both Taha, who left Wells Fargo in July, and former branch manger Julie Miller, who left in 2013, say management was central to allowing to scandal to proliferate. Taha and Miller recalled reporting multiple instances of reporting co-workers for illegally opening deposit and credit card accounts without consumer consent—only to see the same employees promoted or receive a raise later. Meanwhile, the bank continued to set high sales targets for its branches. “I was told by Wells Fargo district and regional management to make my personal bankers and tellers, ‘Sell, Sell, Sell,'” Miller recalled, noting that she had a 35% annual growth target despite being having a finite customer base. “Bankers became so desperate to reach their sales goals to avoid being terminated, that they would ‘churn’ accounts. This is when you close accounts and open up new ones for the same customer in order to manipulate the sales system. See also: Wells Fargo Is No Longer the Most Valuable Bank in the World Taha said that he had to meet sales goals every day, for fear of getting written up or fired. That daily quota often involved 10 to 15 personal accounts, 2 to 3 new accounts, and 2 to 3 credit card accounts. Yet, wages for the average teller was just 12.40 an hour—making the bonuses given for meeting high sales goals necessary in some cases to “make ends meet.” In July, Wells Fargo’s top consumer banking executive Carrie Tolstedt left the bank with 124.6 million in stock and options. The problem with cross-selling, says Shane Larson, the legislative director at Communications Workers of America, is far more pervasive than at just Wells Fargo. The use of aggressive sales targets is an industry can be seen in J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, SunTrust, among others. See also: Wells Fargo Exec Who Headed Phony Accounts Unit Collected 125 Million Former TD Bank employee Cassaundra Plummer noted that her supervisors had encouraged sales practices that weren’t illegal, but certainly dubious. “I was told to drive the conversation, so basically confuse the customer,” she said. She would tell the client that “we’re going to do this and we’re going to do that.” Still, before critics can turn their attention to the consumer banking industry at large, investors are still not mollified by how Wells Fargo has been punished for the scandal. Many are calling for clawbacks the pay of CEO John Stumpf and the executive formerly in charge of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt. Others are calling for resignations. On Tuesday, Stumpf is expected to appear before the Senate in relation to the account scandal. “Corporate executives designed the sales quota systems and created the culture of harassment and fear when we did not meet them,” Miller said. “When John Stumpf blamed the frontline workers for the unauthorized accounts, I was disgusted.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Former employees of Wells Fargo have alleged that the bank has a history of \\"retaliating against whistleblowers.\\" CNNMoney has now spoken to several former Wells Fargo staff - including human resources workers - who claim the bank has a history of firing staff who tipped off unethical or illegal sales practises.

A “slipcover” is a commercially-made cover for your sofa. In order to purchase the right one, you will need to measure your sofa. Using a tape measure, record the width and length of your couch, as well as the length of the arms. Additionally, you should look for any labels on your sofa. If you can determine the manufacturer and/or specific style of your sofa, you may be able to find a slipcover made especially for it. It can also be helpful to take a photo on your cell phone. You can show this image to a retail employee, and they may be able to help you select the right product. Look for your new slipcover at big box, home supply, fabric, or upholstery stores. Additionally, if you know the manufacturer of your sofa (such as Ikea), you can visit that manufacturer directly (in person or online). Search for a slipcover that fits the size and style of your sofa, as well as the look and feel of your home. If you have an oddly-shaped or vintage sofa, you may need to order a custom-made slipcover from an upholsterer or designer. Slipcovers vary widely in terms of cost. You may find them for as little as 60 (from some big box stores), or as much as 600 (from some furniture retailers). Slipcovers are extremely appealing because they are easy to use. Simply open your new slipcover, remove any pillows or loose items from your sofa, and drape your slipcover over. Often times, there will be ties, Velcro, or other fasteners that will help you to tighten and secure your slipcover. Be sure to read any instructions that come included with your new slipcover. It’s best to wash or steam the slipcover (depending on the instructions on the care tag) before putting it on your sofa to ensure it is soft and wrinkle-free.

To support himself, he takes a job as a road manager for \\"The Great\\" Buck Howard (John Malkovich), a fading mentalist. Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as Bakersfield and Akron. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide his fee for that night's performance, which he then unfailingly discovers. (Kreskin is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)[4] A reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect his career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards her and Troy, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Buck reveals that his comeback will involve putting \\"hundreds\\" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving Jerry Springer.

Question: What is the political affiliation of the person talking ?","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the speaker likely has a political affiliation that leans towards the Democratic Party or at least opposes the Republican Party. This assumption is made due to the negative tone the speaker uses while discussing Sarah Palin, a prominent Republican politician, and her career trajectory. Furthermore, the speaker criticizes the manner in which Republicans have run Washington over the past seven years, implying dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's governance. The Democratic Party, the primary opposition party to the Republican Party in the United States, generally holds contrasting policy views on various issues. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that a person expressing discontent with Republican politicians and their approach to governance might be affiliated with or lean towards the Democratic Party. It is important to note that while this analysis is based on the information provided, one should not definitively conclude the speaker's political affiliation without further details, as political identity can be complex and nuanced. Additionally, the speaker could also be affiliated with another political party, like the Libertarian Party, Green Party, or be an independent with specific political views.

Don’t try to compare your relationship, your body, your house, or anything else you possess to what other people have, or you’ll always come up short. There will always be people who have something “better” than you do—just like there will always be people who are far worse off—and you’ll never be able to live your life on your own terms if you only care about comparing yourself to everyone around you. Remember that what’s great for your neighbor or your best friend may not be the best for you. Focus on doing what you need to make your life better and learn to shut out the other voices. Spending hours on Facebook can lead you to feel that your life, relationship, vacations, or family aren’t nearly as good as everyone else’s. If spending a lot of time on social media makes you feel inadequate about your own life, just stop. If you’re in a serious relationship, focus on doing what’s right for you based on your own timeline instead of trying to move in together, get engaged, or get married based on another couple’s standards. Of course, it can be easier said than done to stop caring about what other people think of you completely. However, you can start to make an effort to do what’s best for you instead of what you think will make other people think you’re gorgeous, successful, savvy, or interesting. In the end, the best thing you can do is to make yourself happy, and if you do that, you’ll be able to drown out the noise anyway. The best way to live an enriching life is to improve yourself and to feel good about the choices you make. If you do this, it won’t matter if people think you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread. Learn to follow your heart. If you want to study theatre instead of law, which is what your parents want, learn to accept that your life will be more enriching if you follow your dreams. Another way to live a more enriching life is to stop caring about doing everything perfectly all the time. You should be comfortable with making mistakes and learning from them instead of with getting everything right on the first try. Sure, your life will feel a lot safer if you continue to make easy choices without messing up, but it will be far more rewarding and enriching if you’re comfortable with taking the wrong path sometimes, knowing that it will lead you to the right one. If you’re too focused on being perfect, then you won’t have time to step back and enjoy your life on its own terms, mistakes and all. Once you accept that you’ll never be 100% right all the time, you’ll be able to make much more interesting choices. If you really want to create meaningful bonds with people, then you have to let them see who you really are, flaws and all. If you want everyone to see you as this perfect person with no vulnerabilities, then people won’t feel like they can ever really open up to you or trust you. If you spend your whole life racing toward a goal, you’ll never be able to appreciate all of the little moments of joy along the way. You’ll also inevitably feel disappointed once you do reach that goal, whether it’s to make partner at your law firm or to get married. If you want to live an enriching life and to enjoy every moment of it, then you have to stop and remember to be proud of or grateful for every little step you take along the way. You don’t want to look back on your life and wonder where all of those years went. Make an effort to live in the moment instead of always thinking ahead to the future, and you’ll be able to live a much more fulfilling, enjoyable life. Make more of an effort to do things “just because.” Not every step you take or person you meet has to help you become more successful. Besides, if you’re never spontaneous, who knows how many opportunities you may miss out on over the course of your life. This may seem like a daunting task, but if you really want to live a more enriching life, then you can’t just go through the motions; you have to find the thing that makes your life worth living. Your purpose doesn’t have to be to succeed in some fancy, challenging career, either; it can be to help other people achieve their goals, to raise your children in a supportive environment, to write fiction even if you’ll never make money doing it, or just to do whatever it is you were meant to do. If you feel like you’ve just been going through the motions and don’t really know what your life’s purpose is, then it’s worth it to take some time to slow down and do some soul-searching and to try new things in order to find it. Remember that it’s never too late. It’s okay if you don’t find an all-consuming purpose to give your life meaning. Just making an effort to steer your life in the direction of something that means a lot to you can make a big difference. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to live a more enriching and happy life. It suggests focusing on small goals, being grateful for what you have, not comparing yourself to others, following your heart, not trying to be perfect, creating meaningful bonds with people, and taking time to enjoy life's moments.

He asserts that the \\"dogmatic commitment to using violence to defend one's faith, both from within and without\\" to varying degrees, is a central Islamic doctrine that is found in few other religions to the same degree, and that \\"this difference has consequences in the real world.\\" In 2006, after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Harris wrote, \\"The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' is a dangerous fantasy--and it is now a particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. But it is important to recognize why this is so--it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms.\\" He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam. Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by The Huffington Post on whether critics of Islam are unfairly labeled as bigots: Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are \\"committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own\\"? ... The freedom to poke fun at Mormonism is guaranteed [not by the First Amendment but] by the fact that Mormons do not dispatch assassins to silence their critics or summon murderous hordes in response to satire. ... Can any reader of this page imagine the staging of a similar play [to The Book of Mormon] about Islam in the United States, or anywhere else, in the year 2013? ... At this moment in history, there is only one religion that systematically stifles free expression with credible threats of violence. The truth is, we have already lost our First Amendment rights with respect to Islam--and because they brand any observation of this fact a symptom of Islamophobia, Muslim apologists like Greenwald are largely to blame. Harris has criticized common usage of the term \\"Islamophobia\\". \\"My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences,\\" he wrote following a controversial clash with Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher, \\"but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people.\\" During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that \\"Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia.

Q: Problem: at what price must an article costing rs . 47.50 be marked in order that after deducting 5 % from the list price . it may be sold at a profit of 40 % on the cost price ? Options: a ) 62.5 , b ) 69.5 , c ) 67.5 , d ) 62.5 , e ) 70 A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding the concept of gain. Usage: Gain is the value by which to multiply the input. In this context, the gain would refer to the profit percentage on the cost price of an article. For example, if the cost price is 100 and the profit required is 40%, then the gain = 1 + (40/100) = 1.4, which means the selling price should be 1.4 times the cost price. Part #2: Deducting a percentage from the list price. Usage: In the problem, a 5% discount is given on the list price. For example, if the list price is 100, the discount given would be 5% (5/100) * 100 = 5, making the actual selling price 100 - 5 = 95. Part #3: Calculating the list price that achieves the required profit after the discount. Usage: Based on Part #1 and Part #2, we can calculate the list price that will give the required profit of 40% on the cost price after deducting the 5% discount. In this case, the actual selling price will be 47.50 * 1.4 = 66.50. Since we need to find the list price, the calculation will be: 66.50 / (1 - 0.05) = 70.

Although its exact founding date is not known, the city began to grow and develop around the 4th century BC. Petra came to prominence as a major trading center due to its strategic location that facilitated the convergence of various trade routes. As mentioned in the context provided, there has been human settlement in the area, such as Beidha, since around 2010 BC. However, the rise of the Nabataean civilization led to the establishment of Petra as a significant city. The region was inhabited by the Madianite nation as early as 1340 BC, as noted by the Jewish historian Josephus. Petra is renowned for its incredible architecture, particularly the rock-cut tombs and monuments. The most iconic of these structures is Al-Khazneh, also known as The Treasury, which is believed to have been constructed in the 1st century AD during the reign of King Aretas IV.

Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.

For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.

A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse's _ , while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media. The research was assigned by law firm Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook, Skype, Snapchat, Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce. Andrew Newbury, of law firm Gordon, said: 'Social media is the new marriage. Five years ago Facebook was rarely mentioned in the context of a marriage ending, but now it has become common.\\" Social media, specific pictures and posts on Facebook, are now being routinely raised in divorces.' The survey by Censuswide among 2011 husbands and wives, found the most common reasons for checking their spouse's social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to, who they were meeting and where they were going. A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week, and 17 percent said such quarrels were daily events. Arguments were caused by contact with former partners, by the sending of secret messages, and by the posting of 'inappropriate' pictures.

The perimeter P of a square is given by: P = 4s Now the question asks for the area of the square with perimeter 2P. Since we're given the perimeter of a square with P, let's find the side length s: s = P / 4 Now let's find the side length and area of a square with a perimeter of 2P: Perimeter of a square with 2P = 8s Side length, s' = (2P) / 4 Now replace P/4 with s: s' = 2 * (P / 4) s' = P / 2 Now, let's find the area of the square with a side length of s': Area of a square with side length s' = (s')^2 Area = (P / 2)^2 Area = P^2 / 4 So, the area of a square with perimeter 2P is P^2/4.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If fewer receptors enter the cell in the perturbation hypothesis, the direct effect on the process might be reduced efficiency in viral replication and infection. With less viral Velcro available to dock onto the target cell and initiate the infection process, there may be a slower rate at which the virus takes over the host cell. In this case, fewer target cells may be affected initially due to the decreased ability of the virus to latch on and enter the cells. However, it is also possible that infected cells might produce fewer copies of new viruses as a result of this perturbation, thus indirectly affecting the rate at which neighboring cells are infected. However, this could lead to a less severe overall infection in the host organism due to reduced viral proliferation, giving the immune system more time to mount a defense against the invading virus. The perturbation, in this case, could lessen the magnitude of the infection and its impact on the host. Nonetheless, even with fewer viral receptors entering cells, there is still the possibility of the virus spreading to other cells and infecting new victims. The perturbation may alter the overall rate and severity of the infection, but it does not necessarily preclude the possibility of further damage to the host or the spread of the virus to other individuals."},{"instruction":"Please briefly summarize this news article: Motorcycle Club Leader Says Weekend Gathering Will Be Peaceful Authentic voices.

These cars are not just any cars, they are minivans and they can drive on the roads with everyone else. Later this month, Waymo is going to let people see these self-driving minivans on the roads for the first time! That means these minivans will drive around without anyone inside controlling them, just like a robot or your remote-controlled toy car. Isn't that cool? These self-driving minivans are very special because they have special computers and cameras inside of them to help them see and think. These helpers allow the minivans to know where they are going and how to get there safely, like when to stop before going into a busy road or how to make a turn without hitting anything. Some people might wonder if it is safe to have cars driving themselves. But the people at Waymo are working very hard to make sure these minivans are very safe. They do lots of tests to make sure the minivans can drive properly and make good choices on the road.

Your task is to generate an answer that is relevant to the question. Can you eat meat? A:","output":"Yes, you can eat meat. In fact, humans have been consuming meat as part of their diet for thousands of years. Meat is a rich source of protein, essential vitamins (such as B12 and B6), and minerals (such as iron, zinc, and selenium). It can contribute significantly to overall health when consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. However, there are certain considerations to keep in mind when consuming meat: 1. Quality: Choose high-quality meat sourced from animals that are raised ethically and sustainably. Look for labels like organic, grass-fed or free-range when purchasing meat products. 2. Processed meats: Consumption of processed meats (such as hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats) should be limited, as they are often high in sodium and preservatives and have been associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer and other health issues. 3. Cooking method: Pay attention to the way meat is cooked. High temperature cooking methods, like frying and grilling, can produce harmful compounds such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to chronic diseases. Opt for healthier cooking methods like baking, roasting, or slow-cooking when possible. 4. Ethical and environmental concerns: Consumption of meat, particularly red meat, has environmental implications like deforestation, greenhouse gas production, and water consumption. Some people choose to reduce their meat intake or follow plant-based diets to address ethical and environmental concerns. 5. Dietary restrictions: Some individuals may choose not to eat meat due to religious, philosophical, or health reasons. It's important to respect and acknowledge these choices and make sure that their diets still provide adequate nutrition. In summary, it is safe and common for humans to eat meat, as it offers essential nutrients. Yet, it's important to be mindful of the quality of meat consumed, the cooking methods, and the ethical and environmental impacts. Individuals with dietary restrictions should plan their diets carefully to ensure they receive the necessary nutrients."},{"instruction":"when warren haynes tells you something in song , you believe it .

Options: - being alive - tongue - voice - brain - speech Explain why a human would choose \\"voice\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"voice\\" as the answer to the question above because it best captures the aspect most directly associated with the experience of listening to someone speak. Let's break down each option to understand why \\"voice\\" is the most suitable choice: 1. Being alive: While it's true that a person must be alive to engage in conversation, this option is too broad and doesn't directly pertain to the actual process of hearing someone talking. 2. Tongue: The tongue is a crucial component in the production of speech, as it helps to articulate different sounds. However, the question asks what we can \\"hear\\" when someone is talking, and we do not literally hear their tongue. We hear the result of the tongue's participation in speech production. 3. Voice: This is the most appropriate answer to the question. The human voice is the audible sound produced by an individual while speaking. It is generated by the vibration of the vocal cords and resonating in the vocal tract, which results in the production of speech. When we listen to someone talking, we hear their voice, which encompasses the unique combination of pitch, tone, and accent that distinguishes one person's speech from another's. 4. Brain: Although the brain is responsible for creating the thoughts and ideas that are communicated through speech, we do not directly hear someone's brain when they are talking. The brain's role in speech production lies in cognitive processes that are not audible to the listener. 5. Speech: While speech is indeed the end product of a person talking, it is not what we hear when someone is speaking. Speech refers to the specific language, words, and structure used to convey a message. The voice, however, is the auditory component that we actually hear when someone is communicating through speech. In this context, \\"voice\\" is a more accurate depiction of what we literally hear when someone is talking. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"voice\\" as the answer to the question because it represents the actual sound that we perceive when a person is talking, which is a direct result of the vocal cords' vibration and the resonance within the individual's vocal tract."},{"instruction":"How do you say \\"Gospel means “good news” and the “good news” is Jesus, the Son of God, who became man to save the world.\\" in Spanish?","output":"To translate the phrase \\"Gospel means “good news” and the “good news” is Jesus, the Son of God, who became man to save the world.\\" into Spanish, I will break down the sentence into smaller parts, translate each part into Spanish, and then combine them to form the complete sentence in Spanish: 1. \\"Gospel means\\" = \\"Evangelio significa\\" 2. \\"good news\\" = \\"buenas noticias\\" 3. \\"and the\\" = \\"y las\\" 4. \\"is Jesus, the Son of God\\" = \\"es Jesús, el Hijo de Dios\\" 5. \\"who became man\\" = \\"que se hizo hombre\\" 6. \\"to save the world\\" = \\"para salvar el mundo\\" Now, let's combine the translated parts to form the complete sentence in Spanish: \\"Evangelio significa buenas noticias y las buenas noticias son Jesús, el Hijo de Dios, que se hizo hombre para salvar el mundo.\\" The translated sentence in Spanish is: \\"Evangelio significa buenas noticias y las buenas noticias son Jesús, el Hijo de Dios, que se hizo hombre para salvar el mundo.\\""},{"instruction":"If \\"In the midst of a crowd of people.\\" does that mean that \\"A woman in a black t-shirt has her arm around a man in a brown hat.\\"?

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Now, I have a new situation: Guyana and Nigeria had thriving economies. Guyana's economy was based on conventional agriculture, while Nigeria attracted an enormous number of tourists to its splendid beaches each year. Answer this question please: Which country caused more marine debris? The answer to this question is:","output":"It is difficult to definitively state which country, Guyana or Nigeria, caused more marine debris without specific data on waste generation and management practices in each country. However, we can discuss some factors that could contribute to marine debris in both countries. Guyana's economy, which is based on conventional agriculture, may contribute to marine pollution through the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and waste from livestock or human sources. These substances can leach into rivers and eventually end up in the ocean, causing hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. Agricultural activities can also lead to soil erosion, which may contribute to sediment pollution in marine environments. Nigeria, on the other hand, is known for its tourism, especially along its beaches. Tourism can be a significant contributor to marine debris due to the accumulation of waste left by visitors. Plastic bags, bottles, food packaging, and other discarded items may eventually make their way into the ocean, either by direct littering or through runoff from stormwater systems.

However, the process that led to its accession to India has deeper historical roots, which can be traced back to the 13th century. Sikkim, a small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Nepal, Tibet, and Bhutan, was originally inhabited by the Lepchas and Limbus people. In the 13th century, the region was introduced to Buddhism by Guru Padmasambhava, and the kingdom's first monarchy was established under the Namgyal dynasty in 1642. Sikkim had been a monarchy ruled by the Chogyals (Dharma Kings) of the Namgyal dynasty until 1975, and Buddhism remains the primary religion. In the 19th century, Sikkim witnessed a series of political interactions with the British colonial power in India, beginning with the 1814-1816 Anglo-Nepalese War. After the war, the British acquired some territories from Nepal and established a Treaty of Titalia in 1817 with Sikkim, recognizing the kingdom's sovereignty and facilitating the reopening of trade routes shut during the war. The British influence in Sikkim increased in the subsequent decades as they established treaties that allowed the British resident in Sikkim, a direct British representation in the kingdom. In 1947, when India gained independence from British rule, Sikkim chose to remain an independent kingdom with a special relationship with India. It signed a Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship with India on December 12, 1950. This treaty established India's responsibility for Sikkim's defense, external relations, and strategic communications while preserving the kingdom's internal autonomy. Despite the treaty, political tensions and social unrest began to grow in Sikkim, with pro-democracy and anti-monarchy segments of the population pushing for integration with India. In 1973, anti-royal demonstrations broke out, and the Sikkim National Congress, a pro-democracy party, secured the support of the Indian government to establish a more democratic government. On April 14, 1975, a referendum in Sikkim was held, and an overwhelming 97.5% of the electorate voted in favor of abolishing the monarchy and joining India as a state. The Indian Parliament passed the 36th constitutional amendment on May 16, 1975, welcoming Sikkim as the 22nd state of the Indian Union. This event integrated Sikkim into the broader North-East region of India, solidifying its position within the Indian political and administrative structure."},{"instruction":"Title: POOR protection for DVDs Review: Warning, all 13 DVDs are stuffed in cheap cardboard slots.

Answer: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was established in 1987 to protect Earth's ozone layer. It is an international treaty with the primary objective of phasing out the production and consumption of various substances that contribute to ozone depletion. The substances targeted under this treaty include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, and other ozone-depleting chemicals. The Montreal Protocol, since its adoption, has undergone several amendments and adjustments to continuously adapt to new scientific findings and updated targets. It has been successful in encouraging countries to work together towards phasing out the use of harmful substances that threaten the ozone layer. As a result, the concentration of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere has significantly decreased, and it is expected that the ozone layer will recover by the middle of the 21st century. The success of the Montreal Protocol is a testament to the power of international cooperation in addressing global environmental challenges. It demonstrates the importance of taking timely and decisive actions based on scientific evidence to protect our planet and its natural resources."},{"instruction":"Agenţia a afirmat de asemenea că respectiva cifră ar putea creşte cu încă 630 mn euro în momentul în care vor fi primiţi banii pentru preluarea Telekom Srpske.

Movie title: Man on the Moon Context: At the beginning, Kaufman's foreign man comes on saying (due to massive editing) it is the end of the film and plays a record alongside the end credits before walking off. Kaufman then comes back on in his normal voice saying he \\"Had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try\\". He then proceeds to show the actual movie on a film projector starting with his childhood home, in Long Island, New York 1957.Flashing forwards to New York City, 1973, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings childrens songs and overuses his \\"foreign man\\" character. Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman. Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy. Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. When Clifton meets Shapiro privately, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and we see that he is actually Kaufman.

To be more specific, option (B) best represents how lions acquire food. They hunt in groups called prides, which typically consist of several adult lionesses, their offspring, and a small number of adult males. Hunting as a group allows them to take down larger prey and increases their success rate compared to hunting alone. Lionesses are the primary hunters in the pride, as they are more agile and have better camouflage than the males, who are often left behind to guard the territory and protect the cubs. They use various hunting techniques, including stalking, ambushing, and working together to encircle their prey. Their primary prey includes wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, and other large herbivores found in their natural habitat. It is important to note that although lions mostly rely on hunting, they are also opportunistic scavengers and will take advantage of carcasses if the opportunity arises, either by displacing other predators or consuming remains left behind by other hunters. In summary, lions get their food primarily through group hunting, using their cooperative skills to take down large prey which helps improve their chances of survival and success in finding nourishment."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

After all, the prospect of being the mother to Simon Cowell’s first child will, one imagines, open many doors in the glitzy social strata she has made it her business to frequent, not to mention access to the X Factor mogul’s £225million fortune. As they were: It appears that the divorce battle between Lauren and","output":"her soon-to-be ex-husband, Andrew Silverman, is heating up, not just due to the alleged adultery and the sensational news of her pregnancy with Simon Cowell's child, but also owing to the complexities of their intertwined social and financial lives. Andrew Silverman, a wealthy real estate tycoon, is said to have been blindsided by the revelation of his wife's affair with Cowell, despite the media often spotting the couple vacationing together on luxurious yachts and attending high-profile parties. It is believed that friends and family members have been left reeling by the news, as they were once considered a close-knit and devoted unit. In the midst of the ongoing divorce proceedings, which have taken a highly public and contentious turn, it appears that Lauren Silverman is determined to battle it out to secure the best possible settlement for herself and her unborn child. Her keenness to rise up in the social circle has been evident throughout her adult life, as she has been strategically networking with prominent and influential individuals. Lauren's aspirations, coupled with the impending arrival of Simon Cowell's first child, is expected to bring about significant changes in their lives and may serve as an impetus for them to redefine their personal and professional priorities. As the father-to-be, Cowell is said to be weighing his options—whether to maintain a low profile while supporting Lauren and the child from a distance or to play an active role in their lives, despite the potential negative PR fallout from the scandal. As the drama continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what direction the lives of these three individuals will take, and how their intertwined relationships will ultimately impact them both personally and professionally.

Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album. - Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 24 November 1991) was a British singer, songwriter and record producer, known as the lead vocalist and co-principal songwriter of the rock band Queen. He also became known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote and composed numerous hits for Queen (including \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", and \\"We Are the Champions\\"); occasionally served as a producer and guest musician (piano or vocals) for other artists; and concurrently led a solo career while performing with Queen. - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014. - The lead vocalist, lead vocals or lead singer in popular music is typically the member of a group or band whose voice is the most prominent in a performance where multiple voices may be heard. The lead singer either leads the vocal ensemble, or sets against the ensemble as the dominant sound. In vocal group performances, notably in soul and gospel music, and early rock and roll, the lead vocalist takes the main vocal part, with a chorus provided by other group members as backing vocalists. - \\"We Are the Champions\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, first released on their 1977 album \\"News of the World\\". Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it is one of Queen's most popular songs, and one of rock's most recognisable anthems. - \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by guitarist Brian May, the track featured on their 1978 album \\"Jazz\\", and later on their compilation album, \\"Greatest Hits\\". When released as a single with \\"Bicycle Race\\", the song reached number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 24 in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in the US. - \`\` Bicycle Race '' is a single by the British rock band Queen . It was released on their 1978 album Jazz and written by Queen 's frontman Freddie Mercury . It was released as a double A-side single together with the song \`\` Fat Bottomed Girls '' . The song is notable for its video featuring a bicycle race with nude women at Wimbledon Stadium , which was edited or even banned in several countries . - Greyhound racing is an organized, competitive sport in which greyhound dogs are raced around a track. There are two forms of greyhound racing, track racing (normally around an oval track) and coursing. Track racing uses an artificial lure (now based on a windsock) that travels ahead of the dogs on a rail until the greyhounds cross the finish line. As with horse racing, greyhound races often allow the public to bet on the outcome. In coursing the dogs chase a \\"lure\\" (originally a live hare or rabbit that could be killed by the dog). - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\". - \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album \\"A Night at the Opera\\". It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda.

Her father is Greek, while her mother was born in New York City. One of her maternal great-grandfathers was an Italian immigrant, and her mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek. Aniston has two half-brothers, John Melick, her older maternal half-brother, and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother. Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance about her career. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged Aniston to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for Friends, a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994-1995 fall lineup. The producers of the show originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was considered to be better suited to the role. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends. She played the character of Rachel from 1994 until the show ended in 2004. The program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Aniston received a salary of US1 million per episode for the last two seasons of Friends, as well as five Emmy nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won, in 2003, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness World Book of Records (2005), Aniston (along with her female costars) became the highest-paid TV actress of all time with her US1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends. Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple were frequently voted as TV's favorite couple by polls and magazines. Following a four-year hiatus from cinema, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of the independent films She's the One (1996), and Dream for an Insomniac (1998).

The latter film opened in relatively few theaters - under 700 in total - taking US14 million at the U.S. box office. In 2002, film critic Roger Ebert declared the role as her breakthrough film, stating that, \\"after languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect (1997), Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her \\"Friends\\" image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil.

Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception - he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again.

All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games.

Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum .

The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985.

Answer:","output":"Seward, New York, is a town named in honor of William H. Seward, a prominent statesman who served as the United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869. William H. Seward was born on May 16, 1801, in the village of Florida, Orange County, New York. Seward was a key figure in American politics during the 19th century, particularly in the lead-up to and during the American Civil War. He was a member of the Whig Party and later a founding member of the Republican Party. Before serving as Secretary of State under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, Seward held positions as a New York State Senator, Governor of New York, and United States Senator. As Secretary of State, Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, a transaction sometimes referred to as \\"Seward's Folly\\" due to widespread skepticism about the value of the territory at the time. However, this acquisition proved to be of great strategic and economic importance for the United States in the years that followed. The town of Seward, New York, was established on February 28, 1840, and named in his honor to acknowledge his achievements and contributions to the nation. This small town, with a population of around 1,700 people, is located in Schoharie County, approximately 50 miles west of Albany, the state capital. The town is predominantly rural, with agriculture being the primary industry in the area. In summary, the town of Seward, New York, is named after William H. Seward, a US Secretary of State who was born on May 16, 1801."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"i like it\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely?

The brown dog weighs 4 pounds. The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. The grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog. What's the average weight of all the dogs? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Determine the weight of each dog. - Brown dog weighs 4 pounds (already given). - Black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. Since the brown dog weighs 4 pounds, the black dog weighs 4 + 1 = 5 pounds. - White dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. Since the brown dog weighs 4 pounds, the white dog weighs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. - Grey dog weighs 2 pounds less than the black dog. Since the black dog weighs 5 pounds, the grey dog weighs 5 - 2 = 3 pounds. Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all the dogs. Total weight = weight of brown dog + weight of black dog + weight of white dog + weight of grey dog Total weight = 4 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 20 pounds Step 3: Calculate the average weight of all the dogs.

Q: Passage: For the last time Fairfax's appearance in arms helped to shape the future of the country, when George Monck invited him to assist in the operations about to be undertaken against John Lambert's army. In December 1659 he appeared at the head of a body of Yorkshire gentlemen, and such was the influence of Fairfax's name and reputation that 1,200 horse quit Lambert's colours and joined him. This was speedily followed by the breaking up of all Lambert's forces, and that day secured the restoration of the monarchy. For these actions, along with his honourable conduct in the civil war, he was spared from the wave of Royalist retributions. In April 1660 Fairfax was re-elected MP for Yorkshire in the Convention Parliament. He was put at the head of the commission appointed by the House of Commons to wait upon Charles II, at the Hague and urge his speedy return. Fairfax provided the horse on which Charles rode at his coronation. The remaining eleven years of the life of Lord Fairfax were spent in retirement at his seat in Yorkshire. His wife died in 1665 and Fairfax died at Nunappleton in 1671. He was buried at Bilbrough, near York.

(2). spontaneous mutation. (3). food chains. (4). ecological pyramids. Q: What can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem? A: Answer:","output":"The concept of demonstrating the decrease in energy, biomass, or numbers within an ecosystem is best illustrated by Ecological Pyramids, which are graphical representations that show the reduction in factors such as energy, biomass, and population size from one trophic level to another within a food web or ecosystem. There are three main types of ecological pyramids: 1. Pyramid of Numbers: This pyramid shows the decreasing number of organisms at each trophic level, from producers to top predators. For an example, there could be thousands of grass plants (producers), hundreds of grasshopper (primary consumers), tens of frogs (secondary consumers) and only one bird (tertiary consumer) in a particular ecosystem. 2. Pyramid of Biomass: This pyramid depicts the corresponding decreasing biomass (total amount of living or organic matter) from the producers to the tertiary consumers. Biomass decreases at each trophic level because every organism uses substantial energy for life processes like respiration, growth, reproduction, waste elimination etc. and that energy cannot be passed to the next level. 3. Pyramid of Energy: This pyramid shows the decrease in energy from one trophic level to the next. The energy flow in the ecosystems is unidirectional and non-cyclic i.e., it flows from the sun to producers (plants), and then from producers to consumers. Each time energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, about 90% is lost as heat and only 10% is incorporated into the biomass of the next trophic level. Thus, the energy available decreases with each successive trophic level. Ecological Pyramids are a fundamental tool in understanding the structure of an ecosystem and highlighting inefficiencies in energy transfer which can affect populations. They demonstrate the principle of energy conservation and the inefficiency of energy transfer, which is a limiting factor in the length of food chains and hence the numbers and sizes of organisms within the community. In effect, they also exhibit the concept of 'carrying capacity'- a population-level concept referring to the maximum number of organisms that an environment can support. The decrease in biomass, energy, or numbers from the base to the apex of the pyramid represents the fact that due to energy loss in successive trophic levels, the environment can support fewer organisms as we move up the pyramid. In summary, ecological pyramids visualize the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem, providing a succinct way to understand and quantify the different ecological parameters as they escalate from primary producers to apex predators. They effectively demonstrate the inherent checks and balances of natural ecosystems, and the fact that every component within an ecosystem is interconnected and mutualistic."},{"instruction":"Strike<br>Fred worked at a grocery store that was about to go on strike.

It looks flat and thin, like a two-dimensional object. But in reality, it has a little bit of thickness, making it a three-dimensional object since it has length, width, and height. In our real world, it's not possible to make a truly two-dimensional object because everything has some amount of thickness, even if it's super tiny! So, to answer your final question, no, these questions are not the same. The first one is about finding the visible part of a cuboid, and the second one is about whether a truly two-dimensional object can exist in a three-dimensional space. They're both interesting questions, but they're about different topics."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Well now look at them #astros","output":"Part 1: Classify the given tweet into three categories: 'Hate Speech', 'Offensive', and 'Neither'. Usage: In this task, we have to analyze the tweet and assign it to one of the mentioned categories. Part 2: 'Hate Speech' is a threatening statement or sometimes includes a call for violence. Usage: \\"We must get rid of people like them, they are a threat to our society!\\" This statement can be considered 'Hate Speech' because it is threatening a group of people and may imply violence against them. Part 3: An 'Offensive' statement just offends someone. Usage: \\"You're such an idiot for liking that team, I can't believe you have such terrible taste.\\" This statement can be considered 'Offensive' because it targets and insults someone's preference without any threats or calls for violence. Part 4: 'Neither' is when it doesn't fall into Hate Speech or Offensive category. Usage: \\"I'm not a fan of that team, but I respect your choice to support them.\\" This statement can be considered 'Neither' because it neither threatens anyone nor offends them but simply expresses a personal opinion while respecting others' choices. Tweet Analysis: \\"Don't follow the astros they said. They're trash they said. Well now look at them #astros\\" This tweet seems to be expressing a defensive stance towards a sports team, specifically the Astros. It does not threaten or call for violence, nor does it directly offend anyone. Therefore, it can be classified as 'Neither'."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from: (A). neutral. (B). furious.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch .

How important is it to you to preserve the legacy of American Idol? Simon Fuller: For the last 15 seasons we've been very protective of the TV show. We've never done more than one season a year. The touring and merchandising has always been thoughtful. I think we've had great integrity [in] protecting the brand so it wasn't tarnished. So here we are facing our last season on Fox and now the legacy can be more in our focus. Now we can catch our breath. It allows me to rethink the show for the first time. When you're a No. 1 show, it's hard to be too bold and brazen about changing the format because it's working and succeeding. Also, you're always rushing to get the next season completed. Now we start with a clean sheet of paper. See photos of all of the \\"American Idol\\" winners over the years: 'American Idol' creator Simon Fuller: The show 'will be coming back for sure' (Photo by Gregg DeGuire/WireImage via Getty Images) (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) Read More: 'American Idol' Cancels Summer Tour The broadcasting landscape has changed so much since Idol debuted. How will streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu affect the next incarnation of the series? There are loads of ideas being shared and I'm deep in thought about how we can evolve Idol. We debuted at the very beginning of the digital world. So the next generation of Idol will be a lot more interactive, a lot more immersive. For me the most exciting thing is we can really now dive deep with all the new technology that's coming. My head is exploding with opportunities. The next generation of Idol -- and Idol will certainly be coming back for sure -- will have a youthful glow and it will be pioneering again, just as it was when we first began. How do you feel going into the final week of Idol on Fox? The overriding emotion is pride. It's been an amazing 15 years and it's the first time ever that I've been able to look back and think, wow, that was pretty good. We made our mark; we made history. It's exceeded all expectations. In the entertainment industry, you very rarely get to look back. For the first time, I've managed to do that in these past two or three weeks and that will carry me through the finale. Saying goodbye to a lot of people I may not work with again, that's the only sadness for me. [Along with] my partners at Fremantle, I think the group [working on the] show has been pretty much the same since day one. I'm pleased that the final show will still have the warmth and the excitement as the first show 15 seasons ago. In many ways it still feels youthful. Observing the studio audiences over the years, it's clear that Idol has appealed to all ages and that's its been one of the rare series entire families watch together. I think that's certainly one of the legacy points. It was a show that the family could watch. Music unites people. Whether you're five or you're 55 or 85, the musical tastes of the world are more aligned than they ever have been. There was a time when what a teenager liked would be polar opposite to what their parents would like. That's not the case anymore. Looking back on the 15 years, what are your personal highlights? The first season finale with Kelly [Clarkson] and Justin [Guarini], I thought that was a very special moment. Finding Carrie Underwood was significant. When you saw her, even in her innocent, raw state, you knew she had the potential to be a big star. Kelly and Carrie represent the purity of Idol...; the perfect American dream. I think Chris Daughtry's journey was a significant one. People thought he had a good chance of winning and he got knocked out early, but his talent saw him through. It allowed him in some ways to reinvent himself and create Daughtry the band, so he had this rock persona that maybe would have been a little bit harder for him to achieve if he had been a solo winner and won the whole show. And he went on to sell millions of records and so in the most unlikely way, he achieved all his dreams too. Do you have a favorite performance? I have so many. Adam Lambert doing \\"Mad World\\" was one of my favorites. It was unexpected and magnificent. Read More: 'American Idol' Farewell: Pundits and Bloggers Reflect on 15 Years of Covering the Show Have you thought about the impact that the show has had on the economy? I quite often think about that. It's something that hasn't been recognized as much as it should have been. Whether that's all the people employed, the hotels that have been booked, the hundreds of thousands of concert tickets sold, all that music that's been sold, all the merchandise, all those people that are fueling other shows, Broadway and the movies that our stars have been in. The advertisers that have bought into the show. We had that wonderful close relationship with iTunes for many years. The impact of Idol and its value is billions and billions. How did Idol's relationship with the music industry change over the years? I created Idol to find another path to break artists -- I could see them [perform] and engage with the the audience who would, in a way, tell me who they felt was interesting and who they believed could go on and be a star. It was a new paradigm -- a new way to take an artist and music to the consumer, and have them buy the songs and go and see the concerts. I didn't need the music industry. So initially, there was a little bit of resentment. Not overt, more like -- Well, hang on, this is bypassing the development process, the A&R process, the talent scout process, the producing and it can't have value because you can't do that. It's too quick, no one's paid their dues, they haven't learned their trade, it can't be good enough, it can't be appropriate. And so there was a little bit of disdain toward Idol. But the success was massive all over the world -- this was happening in England, in Germany, in Australia, in South Africa, in Sweden, in India -; everywhere young, new artists were selling millions of records and being No. 1 in every country in the world -- you could not ignore it. We worked with Sony for many years and then Universal. We embraced the industry; we didn't alienate it. And then, guess what? Everyone wanted to be on a TV show, everyone wanted to create a TV show and there were hundreds of them around the world. I like to think that Idol helped the music industry grow up a bit and understand that music can be everywhere. It was a point when the music industry was going through so much change; it was the advent of the digital age. The digital world shocked the music industry. They withdrew into their own world rather than step out and be strident and confident. And I was strident and confident. I just went for it. And I think the success I had gave everybody confidence. Do you recall where you were when the first kernel of the idea to create American Idol came into your mind? At my house in the South of France. I would spend my summers there. The first thoughts of what this could were: how do you use the internet and create an interactive experience where people can affect the outcome or choose the songs than an artist would sing, or choose the members? I have had so many great ideas there. It's the time when I can relax and I'm not doing anything and I'm the most comfortable. What else is on your plate right now? I've got a diverse company that [includes] my fashion businesses with Victoria and David Beckham and Roland Mouret. I'm active in many different sports. I just acquired the Miami soccer franchise with David Beckham. We found the land to build our stadium; last week we closed on that. I'm doing a new TV show for the BBC, which is quite different from what I've done previously, which I'll keep secret [for now], but it's a very exciting project, with a global perspective. I'm very excited about the new technologies. I'm working with a company called Pulse, creating a virtual pop star. I've spent a whole lot of time thinking about this, I've been waiting for the technology to be good enough to make it happen. We have the digital rights for Elvis Presley and we're building a virtual reality show around him. We're still launching new artists and we still have Annie Lennox and Aloe Blacc so music is still very prominent in all that I do. Where do you feel most at home these days? I love Los Angeles. I come from England and lived in London for many years. My wife is American and when we were dating she moved to live with me in London. Then we got married and when we had Grace, our first child, Natalie wanted to move to America. I said, \\"Let's go!\\" and that was six years ago and I love living here. I love American people and I feel so at home. I'm happy here. Los Angeles is an extraordinary city. It's always been an important city but now it's an essential city.

Paragraph- Sent 1: Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Sent 2: Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. Sent 3: He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. Sent 4: The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. Sent 5: His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. Sent 6: His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Sent 7: Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. Sent 8: This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions. Question: In what town and in what year was Durer born?.

Directed by John Doe, and unarguably a profoundly ambitious project, it fails categorically to meet audience expectations. Starting with the screenplay, the narrative is an amalgam of tattered clichés, riddled with plot holes that are large enough for a truck to drive through. The narrative consistently lacks any rational internal logic and seems to be haphazardly sewn together from discarded remnants of better thrillers. The overall premise — a group of friends discovering an ancient curse on a forest trip — might have been fresh had it been the 80s, but in the current milieu of innovative horror-thriller features, it strikes as an outdated rehash. Moving on to the performances, the cast seems as lost and helpless as the characters they portray. Doomed by a shoddily crafted script, they are forced to blunder onward, producing profoundly uninspiring and monotonous performances. The leading actor, in particular, gives an underwhelming portrayal and lacks the charisma necessary to carry such an intense role. The moments where performances could have added dimension to the tale are overshadowed by exaggerated reactions and overdramatic expressions. The production quality is sub-par at best and fails to add any redeeming value to the movie. It dons the veil of a low-budget indie film under which it tries to hide its lack of concept and poor execution. Plagued by choppy editing and jarring transitions, each scene seems disjointed, obstructing any fluid cinematic storytelling. Lackluster sound editing and a forgettable score contribute to a pervasive sensory disarray throughout the movie. Contrary to the title, the film seems to be devoid of any existential shadows or undertones. Instead, what we get is a literal interpretation involving poor CGI shadows that are not only unintentionally funny but also considerably diminish the purported horror element of the film. While the director intended to intertwine suspense, horror, and thrilling elements into a unified narrative, the movie ends up feeling like a misguided mix of incompatible elements that come off as artificially construed. The ending, in a feeble and unsuccessful attempt at a final twist, falls flat and offers neither satisfaction nor any sense of closure. Regrettably, Deadly Shadows is a squandered opportunity that does not fulfill the promise hinted at in its promising trailer. Any profound messages or themes attempting to emerge drown beneath the weight of poor execution and unimaginative storytelling. Through its disjointed narrative structure, monotonous performances, and poor production value, Deadly Shadows emerges as a forgettable addition to the horror-thriller genre."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from options.

The battle was fought between May 31 and June 12, 1864, with the most significant and intense fighting happening on June 3. This battle marked a turning point in Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, as his forces attempted to make progress towards the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The Battle of Cold Harbor is remembered for its brutality and the significant loss of life, particularly among the Union forces. Grant ordered a series of frontal assaults against heavily fortified Confederate positions, which were led by General Robert E. Lee. These assaults resulted in thousands of Union casualties within a short period, as soldiers encountered a well-prepared and entrenched Confederate army. The battle demonstrated the futility of direct assaults against well-defended positions, and it ultimately led to a shift in strategy among Union forces. It also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Confederate forces under Lee's command in the face of constant pressure from the Union army. The aftermath of the Battle of Cold Harbor was a sobering reminder of the human costs of the American Civil War and the often harsh realities of 19th-century warfare."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917-1969). Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway. Pound was born in a small, two-story house in Hailey, Idaho Territory, the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858-1942) and Isabel Weston (1860-1948). His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the General Land Office. Both parents' ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from William Wadsworth (1594-1675), a Puritan who emigrated to Boston on the Lion in 1632. The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York. Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston, Ezra's mother. Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, with his brother, Ezra Weston, and his brother's wife, Frances, looking after Mary and Isabel's needs. On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a Quaker, who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, Thaddeus Coleman Pound (1832-1914), was a Republican Congressman from northwest Wisconsin who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a house in Hailey. Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old. Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. The family moved to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in Wyncote.

After 1 year, the total amount in the account is the initial amount (1,000) plus the interest (200). 1,000 + 200 = 1,200 4. Tony takes out half of the money to buy a new TV.

Romney told me that the statement came out wrong, because it was an attempt to placate a rambling supporter who was saying that Obama voters were essentially deadbeats. “My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,” Romney said. “If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.” I had never heard Romney say that he was prompted into the “47 percent” line by a ranting supporter. It was also impossible to ignore the phrase “If I had to do this again.” Liebovitch was interested in the “on-the-record-all-the-time” idea as a reflection of Romney’s “limitations as a candidate.” But I’d say it captures the central nature of Romney’s entire 2012 campaign. Throughout the primaries he was always in effect talking to some angry if not entirely coherent Republican voter or donor or media opinion-leader, and trying to “reflect back” to their POV, which Mitt did not entirely share but had to take very, very seriously.

Ryan remains a vocal supporter of Romney's and discussed this in his interview with Rose. He addressed mounting speculation Romney could mount a third White House bid in 2016 and implied he would gladly be Romney's running mate once again. \\"I'll be his bus driver if he wants me to be.

He addressed the infamous \\"47 percent: video, which was widely seen as pivotal in the last election, during a larger discussion of what Ryan described as \\"mistakes\\" he believes he and other conservatives have made when discussing poverty. Rather than criticizing those who are \\"dependent\\" on government, Ryan argued conservatives need to clearly articulate support for \\"bottom-up pro-growth policies\\" to combat poverty that are focused on local community organizations. He contrasted this with what he described as the \\"governing philosophy that's prevailing in Washington right now,\\" which is focused on social welfare programs run by the government. Ryan, who recently wrote a book outlining his ideas to combat poverty also discussed the possibility he could run for president in 2016.

Content Variety and Accessibility: Com.unleashyouradventure.swaccess does a commendable job when it comes to the diversity of content available in the app. With content-ranging from novels, novellas, short stories, and even audiobooks, there's enough to keep adventure lovers satiated for hours on end. Furthermore, I was impressed to find that most stories cater to an array of interests and preferences, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their favorite genres. The addition of offline reading mode is a great feature for those who don't always have access to Wi-Fi or mobile data. 3. Personalized Recommendations and Organization: The app's personalized recommendation engine is quite beneficial, tailoring suggestions based on user preferences. The virtual \\"bookshelf\\" allows users to easily organize their favorites and pending reads. However, this feature could be improved further, by allowing users to create custom bookshelves catering to different themes and genres. 4. Community and Social Features: The ability to connect with fellow users through this app adds a sense of community and elevates the social experience. Users, can discuss, rate, and review books as well as share recommendations with others. One area that could benefit from improvement is the integration of social media sharing options, allowing users to share their literary experiences beyond the app's ecosystem. 5. Pricing and Subscription: Although the app offers a decent selection of free content, the subscription pricing does seem to be on the higher end. A more competitive pricing model could potentially attract a broader range of users. Additionally, incentives like occasional promotions and engaging referral programs could be explored to make it more enticing. In conclusion, com.unleashyouradventure.swaccess is an excellent app for adventure enthusiasts who crave an engaging and immersive reading experience. The vast content library, personalized recommendations, and social elements make it easy to see why users are drawn to this app. While there is a bit of room for improvement in terms of design, organizational features, and pricing, its shortcomings are overshadowed by the numerous benefits offered. I confidently rate this app a solid 4 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to readers seeking stimulating and entertaining content on the go."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Johnny Young (born Johnny Benjamin de Jong; 12 March 1947) is a Dutch Australian singer, composer, record producer, disc jockey, television producer and host.

One day, some smart people found a special stone called the Rosetta Stone. This stone had the same message written in three different ways, with one of those ways being hieroglyphics. The other two ways used languages that people could understand. The smart people then compared the messages to figure out what the hieroglyphics meant.

They have changed a lot in the past few years. And now US scientists want to grow vegetables in mini - greenhouses on the moon. Scientists say they are looking forward to a time when people on the moon or even Mars will be able to eat green and fresh vegetables. Paragon Space Development Corporation has shown people what it called the first step toward growing flowers - and finally food - on the moon. Paragon, which is a partner of NASA in experiments at the International Space Station, calls it a \\"Lunar Oasis \\" This is a closed greenhouse placed in a metal box. It is designed to safely land a laboratory plant on the moon surface, and protect it while it grows. The small greenhouse is to be sent up into space by Odyssey Moon Ltd, which takes part in the Google Lunar X Prize.

It has a shatter kind of damage. Typhoon Heavy Flak Cannon is a medium-range cannon that fires explosive projectiles, dealing substantial damage with a wide area of effect. If combined with Lesmok Rounds, it will have a better accuracy and range. Manticore Heavy Hwacha is best used with Heavy Clip. Manticore fires a blinding barrage of 20 rockets for a powerful area of denial effect. Each rocket does light explosive damage. Lumberjack Heavy Mortar is a high-arcing weapon with balloon-damaging flechette AoE. This mid-range weapon is excellent for destroying both hull and balloons alike. It has a very high pitch rotation, and using this at lower altitudes than the target can yield better success. Light guns are the most common weapons in Guns of Icarus Online. There are a total of 12 light guns so far. You can only put light guns in light guns slots. Generally, this type of weapon don't hit as hard as the medium weapon, but it can still wreck a fair amount of havoc with quicker loading times.

Hades Light Cannon is a new cannon released in Guns of Icarus. Its range reaches 1,400 meters (4,593.2 ft) and is effective against balloon, hull, and armor. Javelin Light Harpoon Gun is a harpoon that deals little damage to hulls and reels in enemies when rope is attached. Mercury Field Gun has the longest distance shot and the fastest moving projectile in the game. It’s very effective with Charged Rounds to ensure a hit each shot. If you want an extra shot, take Extended Clip with you. Phobos Mine Launcher lays impact-detonated floating mines at short range. The mines will arm and deploy after 3 seconds, and each gun supports 5 mines at a time. Scylla Double-Barreled Mortar fires heavy explosive shells over medium range with limited accuracy. Using Greased or Burst Rounds is recommended. Whirlwind Light Gatling Gun is a close-range piercing weapon with a very high rate of fire. It’s effective against armor and is commonly used paired with Light Flak Cannon and Double-Barreled Mortar. Using Charged Rounds are recommended.

While William finds the idea of working on the farm and toiling in the soil appealing, Aaron has a different perspective on the matter. This difference in opinion stems from the fact that William has always been drawn to nature and enjoys activities that involve physical work and connecting with the environment, such as gardening or tending to animals. He finds the prospect of working on the farm exciting and views it as an opportunity to engage in something that he is truly passionate about. On the other hand, Aaron has a strong preference for activities that are less physically demanding and are more focused on mental or creative pursuits. He is not a fan of getting his hands dirty and would rather spend his time engaging in activities that align with his own interests and preferences. He may have concerns about the potential challenges and difficulties faced when working on a farm, particularly when it comes to tasks that involve handling dirt, mud, or debris. Additionally, he might see farm work as time-consuming and tiring, detracting from valuable pursuits in other areas of life that he enjoys more. Their differing opinions highlight the fact that what one person finds enjoyable might not hold the same appeal for another person, and this is perfectly normal. Individual tastes and preferences are shaped by various factors, such as their upbringing, past experiences, and personality traits. Because of this, it is important for individuals to respect and understand one another's perspectives, even if they may not personally agree with them. In conclusion, while William thinks working on the farm would be neat as he enjoys getting his hands dirty and connecting with nature, Aaron has a different viewpoint and does not find these tasks appealing or fulfilling.

His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Alexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the cranial cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but had other side effects. His parents were alcoholics though his mother was a sober alcoholic. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs. Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as \\"torture\\" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant.

Choose from options. \\"A long time ago, the Grand Canyon was\\" OPTIONS: a. wider. b. deeper. c. grander. d. less deep.","output":"Answer: d. less deep. Explanation: The Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River over a period of millions of years. As the river flowed, it gradually eroded the rock, carving out the canyon. This means that a long time ago, the Grand Canyon was less deep than it is now as the river continued to erode deeper into the earth over a long period of time. Option a, \\"wider,\\" is incorrect, because as the river erodes the rock, it generally makes the canyon deeper rather than wider. Option b, \\"deeper,\\" is wrong because millions of years ago, the river would have just begun its erosive action, making the canyon significantly less deep than it is today. Option c, \\"grander,\\" is ambiguous and does not specifically correlate to the erosive action of the river. The term \\"grander\\" doesn't purely depict changes in physical dimensions that would occur due to erosion from the river."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

All the given facts are expressed in natural language. Your job is to generate a story 100 to 1000 words long, that includes all the facts given as input in their order of appearance while expanding upon them to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Input: Fact1: Polly Biggs is eldest of family of orphaned children, Fact2: wife is cruel to children, Fact3: young man named is son of opposing mayoral candidate, Fact4: Polly take revenge on uncle, Fact5: Oxmore grants Polly permission to keep children there Output:","output":"Once upon a time, in the charming town of Oxmore, lived a young woman named Polly Biggs. She was the eldest of a family of orphaned children who had once lived a happy and contented life. However, their lives had taken a turn when their parents tragically passed away in a terrible accident that left them under the care of their uncle and his wife. Polly was a responsible and caring sister to her younger siblings, always trying her best to ensure their safety and well-being in the absence of their parents. Sadly, their new guardians did not treat them with the love and kindness they needed. In particular, the uncle's wife displayed incredibly cruel and abusive behavior towards the children. She would regularly punish them for the smallest mistakes and even took pleasure in their pain and suffering. Polly endured this cruelty in silence, in the hope that she could shield her younger siblings from her step-aunt's wicked actions. In the midst of this dire situation, a mayoral election was taking place in Oxmore. There was fierce competition, as the two main candidates had completely different visions for the town. The current mayor, George Stockton, was a kind-hearted man who believed in unity and compassion. His opponent, Roger Truman, was a power-hungry businessman known for his ruthless attitude and cunning strategies. As the election campaign gained momentum, Polly learned of a young man supporting Roger Truman's campaign. His name was Edward, and he was the son of Roger Truman, the opposing mayoral candidate. Edward was well-aware of the miseries of the orphaned children, as well as the cruelty shown by the uncle's wife towards them. He felt inclined to help them in any way possible, as he believed that his father surely would once he assumed office. He approached Polly to speak privately about their situation. Polly, who had reached her breaking point due to their mistreatment, saw an opportunity to take revenge on the cruel relatives who had made her family's life a living hell. She confided in Edward about their suffering, and he vowed to help her on the condition that Polly would support his father's candidacy for mayor. Reluctantly and without much choice, Polly agreed, envisaging this partnership as a chance to secure freedom and a better future for her family. Their involvement led to a dramatic political showdown in Oxmore. Polly, the young and morally upright eldest sister, challenging her morally corrupt relations, captivated local media and public opinion. With the support of Edward, she revealed her relatives' true nature to the town's residents and gained popular sympathy. The resulting political confrontation resulted in the defeat of both her cruel uncle and Roger Truman, as Oxmore citizens demanded justice for the orphaned children. Consequently, George Stockton, the incumbent mayor, won the election. After the mayoral elections, Mayor Stockton, recognizing Polly's courage and the difficulties her family had endured, granted her permission to keep the children with her, while providing them with a safe and comfortable home to recover and flourish. Thus, Polly's younger siblings finally began to lead a happier, more stable life, where they could begin to heal from their painful experiences. Additionally, Edward and Polly began to grow closer as a result of their partnership, finding solace in each other, and forging a strong bond. In the end, Polly's heroic actions brought her family a renewed sense of hope, empowerment, and unity. Her bravery, combined with the support of a loyal friend and a just leader, served as an inspiration to the entire town of Oxmore. It showcased the inherent strength of human determination in the face of adversity, validating the old adage that good will always triumph over evil."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: what is metal music about I found the following answer on Google: The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout the history of the genre.

How can I understand time dilation properly? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"Time dilation is a bit like when characters in a cartoon move differently in slow motion or super fast. In real life, this happens because of a big idea called relativity, which a smart man named Albert Einstein thought of. When things go really, really fast, like close to the speed of light, time actually goes slower for them compared to someone who's standing still or moving slower. That's called time dilation! To understand time dilation better, let's think of a simple example: Imagine you and your friend have magic stopwatches that show time for each of you separately. You both press \\"start\\" on your stopwatches at the same time. But now imagine your friend hops on a super-fast spaceship while you stay on Earth. When your friend comes back, you compare your stopwatches and see that they show different times! That's because time for your friend in the spaceship went slower due to time dilation.

Tripoli, with its metropolitan area, has a population of about 1.1 million people. The city is located in the northwestern part of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean and forming a bay. Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks. - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions. - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake. - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war . - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes. - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron. - George Downie (19 January 1778 11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada, Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance. He retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary...

Reds started their counteroffensive against Kolchak's forces at the end of April. The Red 5th Army, led by the capable commander Tukhachevsky, captured Elabuga on 26 May, Sarapul on 2 June and Izevsk on the 7th and continued to push forward.

Following the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the Tobol. In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted retreat of the Whites to the east. On 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk. Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after this defeat; White Army forces in Siberia essentially ceased to exist by December.

Movie title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help â advice that Alfredo often...

The city's infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with the population growth and the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, causing daily traffic jams, delays in public transportation, and increased commuting times. As a consequence, the traffic congestion is also contributing to increased air pollution, health problems, stress, and decreased productivity in the workforce. City officials are eager to find ways to combat this pressing issue. Hypothesis: The adoption of a comprehensive strategy involving the development of an efficient public transportation system, the promotion of alternative modes of transport, and the implementation of smart traffic management technologies could significantly reduce traffic congestion in the city, thus improving the overall quality of life for its residents. This hypothesis proposes that an integrated approach, addressing multiple aspects of traffic management, will be more effective in reducing congestion compared to addressing each issue separately. The key elements in this strategy include: 1. Develop an efficient public transportation system: Investing in a well-connected, reliable, and affordable public transportation network, including buses, trains, and metros, will encourage more people to opt for public transit over private vehicles. This will reduce the number of cars on the roads, potentially easing congestion. Additionally, providing dedicated lanes for buses and implementing bus rapid transit systems can improve the speed and efficiency of public transport, making it a more appealing option for commuters. 2. Promote alternative modes of transport: City officials can encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation such as cycling, walking, or carpooling. This can be achieved by developing safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, such as bike lanes and pedestrian zones, and promoting initiatives like bike-sharing programs. Furthermore, campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of carpooling can incentivize people to share rides, ultimately reducing the number of cars on the roads during peak hours. 3. Implement smart traffic management technologies: Integrating intelligent traffic management systems like adaptive traffic signals, real-time traffic monitoring, and congestion prediction tools can enable more efficient use of existing road infrastructure. These systems can optimize signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, improve incident management, and provide accurate traffic data to commuters, helping them make informed decisions about their travel plans. 4. Incentivize off-peak travel and remote work: To further reduce peak-hour congestion, city officials can introduce policies and incentives that encourage off-peak travel and remote work. This may include variable pricing for parking and tolls during peak hours, subsidized public transit passes for off-peak travel, or tax incentives for employers who support remote work practices. By implementing this multi-dimensional approach, the hypothesis suggests that the city could see a significant reduction in traffic congestion, leading to improved air quality, reduced stress levels, and increased overall productivity among the population."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Another playoff-free Toronto Raptors season ended Wednesday with a feeling that the team had just ended three seasons in one. In the autumn, an atrocious 4-19 start; the winter, a rebound highlighted by the end of the Jose Calderon era and the dawn of the Rudy Gay one; and with spring, a five-game losing streak that ended, once and for all, any post-season hopes. The result is a 34-48 record, seventh-best in franchise history. That's 18 seasons of history. More on that later. In a fast-food media age where information and hype is half-processed and forgotten within minutes, perspective is something that appears to be going the way of the daily newspaper. Yet the case can be made that the Raptors, 10th in the Eastern Conference, ended up exactly where most pundits expected. John Hollinger, in a different career back in October, predicted the Raptors would win 33 times. He came up one short. That's not to say all news is bad. This is a different team than the one that started the season, one that played .500 ball after that hellish start. You can make the case that they would have made the playoffs had the current core been in place all year. Jonas Valanciunas' development was a pleasure to watch and he's clearly a player on the rise. Amir Johnson was the team's true MVP. Don't believe me? Look up his advanced stats. Yet the questions begin after that. Acquiring Gay was, by team president and general manager Bryan Colangelo's own admission, a move made to secure a top-flight player in part because of the perception -- real or imagined -- that Toronto is nobody's top choice in free agency. Of course, it's also debatable if Gay is, in fact, a top-flight player. Yes, he's a good player. But a superstar? In paycheque only. There is also the issue, quickly dismissed by Gay and DeMar DeRozan, that the two wing players, lacking effective outside shooting, duplicate each other too much. Then, there is the curious case of point guard Kyle Lowry and his relationship with head coach Dwane Casey. Those can be resolvable issues, however. Colangelo, or whoever is in charge of the team this summer, must liberate the franchise of Andrea Bargnani. Subsequently, there is logical conjecture that DeRozan could be dangled as well. Casey, as good a coach as he is, didn't have this year's team on the same page the way he did with last year's less-talented group. Which brings us to the 50-million question: What about Colangelo? This is his team. There is about 50 million in guaranteed money next season for five players (including Bargnani) who have never played in an NBA all-star game. That's the negative. Some positive value can be gleaned from the play of Johnson and DeRozan this year. Yet more questions pop up regarding probable extensions for Gay and Lowry. Colangelo is good corporate soldier Keeping Colangelo means Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment stays the current course. It's a course most agree is a path to sustained mediocrity. Yet before fans assume that MLSE will clear the decks and start fresh just because they fired Maple Leafs president and GM Brian Burke and rebooted Toronto FC, keep in mind that Burke's dismissal was not only performance-based. As for TFC, they've been a gong show from Day 1. Colangelo has had past success, is a good corporate soldier for MLSE and is, by all accounts, well liked. But that's the micro. The macro is the Raptors' standing overall. It's been written and broadcast to death how the franchise has chased its tail for years, how minus two legitimate bright spots (2001, 2007), it's been mired in mediocrity. In a city obsessed with continental relevance, observers far too frequently wax poetic about the Raptors' relevance within it. Most of the stories I read Thursday morning alluded to it. If the organization is not going to hit the reset button -- which it most certainly won't -- and go all-in on a shot next year at Andrew Wiggins, a player who may well represent an unprecedented opportunity in Canadian sports history, can we please drop the relevance talk for good? Yes, a new GM would likely signal the sort of rebuild predicated on high draft picks. But MLSE doesn't operate in high-risk territory. My opinion or fans' opinions mean nothing here. For better or for worse, I expect Colangelo will be back, perhaps without Casey, and this team will challenge for one of the bottom-three playoff spots next year.

While the administration's interest in U.S. military involvement in Syria remains low, planners still have been preparing for the possibility U.S. forces would have to step in and neutralize Syria's military or safeguard chemical weapons stockpiles. It's not a pretty picture, NATO commander Adm. James Stavridis said Tuesday, a day after unconfirmed reports emerged that chemical weapons may have been used. \\"The Syrian situation continues to become worse and worse and worse,\\" he said. The mere possibility of U.S. involvement comes at a bad time for the military, which is preparing to ground some aircraft, scrap some naval deployments and cut back on training to meet budget cuts mandated by forced spending cuts that went into effect last month. Depending on what the administration might decide to do - and no decisions have yet been made to do anything - military intervention also could meet with resistance from a public weary of war after the long conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Several NATO countries are working on contingency plans for military action in Syria, including imposing a no-fly zone, providing lethal military assistance to rebel groups and imposing an arms embargo on the Syrian government, Stavridis said. NATO hasn't discussed any such options as a whole, he said. In Washington, military commanders continue to advocate strongly for a diplomatic solution rather than a military strike, a senior U.S. official said. The top U.S. military officer said this week that Syria poses the most complex set of issues he could conceive. \\"About six months ago we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition,\\" said Gen.

But Obama decided to limit U.S. assistance to nonlethal aid, and Dempsey now seems more averse to arming groups that may be influenced by extremist elements. \\"I don't think at this point I can see a military option that would create an understandable outcome. And until I do, it would be my advice to proceed cautiously,\\" he said. Obama has not yet asked to see an action plan, senior military officials say. Here's a look at some of the options under consideration by NATO officials and Washington: NATO has installed Patriot missile batteries in Turkey, near its border with Syria, which could be aimed to shoot down Syrian aircraft, Stavridis said But Turkey only allowed the missile batteries to be placed there for defensive purposes, and NATO nations would have to agree before they could be used for offensive strikes against Syria. That's not something under immediate consideration, Stavridis said. The U.S. military has enough airpower in the region to take action against Syria, according to officials. That includes fighter jets and bombers spread out across air bases in the Middle East and nearby aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy also has warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies. But such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in Syria, the officials said. Other options include bombing runways to prevent Syrian aircraft from taking off, or disrupting communication between the regime leaders and ground commanders. The United States has no plans to put \\"boots on the ground\\" in Syria. But the Pentagon is a planning machine, so the Defense Department last year came up with a military analysis of a ground option should the president request it. According to the analysis, it would take up to 75,000 troops to secure Syria's chemical weapons facilities if they were in danger of being looted. An actual deployment would likely involve far fewer ground troops, and from various nations, but it underscores the scope of the challenge. Before ground troops would go in, weeks of airstrikes would be needed to destroy Syria's air defenses. The military believes Syria has about 50 weapon production sites around the country, as well as some storage areas and research centers. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the potential involvement of the U.S. military in Syria, should efforts to neutralize the Syrian military or safeguard chemical weapon stockpiles become necessary. The situation in Syria continues to worsen, and NATO countries are considering various contingency plans for military action. However, U.S. military commanders strongly advocate for a diplomatic solution rather than a military strike. Possible military options include imposing a no-fly zone, providing lethal military assistance to rebel groups, and imposing an arms embargo on the Syrian government. The article highlights the complexities and potential risks involved in military intervention, such as releasing chemical agents into the air or the need for a large number of ground troops."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

The opinions expressed are their own. This piece is part of an ongoing series on tax reform ideas. Where do you stand? Come back regularly to be a part of the national debate. We are overdue for tax reform. The tax code is outdated, unfair, unnecessarily complicated, and raises inadequate resources to meet national problems and priorities. Many observers envision tax reform modeled on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but the dual objectives of the ’86 reform—maintain the same overall level of revenue and the same distribution of the tax share across income levels—are inappropriate under current circumstances. Projected future deficits signal the need for more revenue, and growing income inequality signals the need to reexamine the fairness of the code. Properly designed tax reform could help tackle deficits and spur stronger economic growth while simplifying the code for individuals and businesses. The complexity of the code derives from a decades-long proliferation of tax code preferences, known as tax expenditures, which will lead to more than 1 trillion in lost revenue this year alone. Many of these tax expenditures, such as itemized deductions, are highly regressive because their value is larger for those in higher tax brackets and because they do not benefit tax filers claiming the standard deduction (typically lower-income workers). For example, the mortgage interest deduction — the second most costly expenditure — is worth 35 cents on the dollar to someone with an income of 1 million, but just 15 cents on the dollar to an itemizing married couple earning 60,000. It has no value at all for a family taking the standard deduction. Admittedly, abruptly wiping the slate clean of tax expenditures in order to broaden the base, lower rates and raise revenue seems unlikely politically and would remove some valuable incentives, such as those for charitable giving. A more plausible approach would be to cap the value of itemized deductions at a fixed flat rate, thereby leveling the playing field for average families in relation to upper-income individuals and limiting revenue loss. For example, limiting the benefit of itemizing deductions to 15% of their value would save 1.3 trillion over a decade. Certain deductions could then be converted to refundable tax credits that either benefit all filers or target a subset to better achieve policy objectives. The mortgage interest deduction could be converted to a flat refundable credit for interest on mortgages under500,000 (the current eligibility threshold is 1.1 million.)Particularly regressive and costly tax expenditures should be scrapped entirely. For example, the ’86 reform judiciously removed the preferentially low rates on capital gains and dividends. A 1986-style reform would lock in the current distribution of the tax burden, which reflects the regressive Bush-era tax changes that benefited upper-income and wealthier individuals. Instead of protecting the status quo, tax reform should improve fairness in the tax code and undo some of the tax cuts for high-income individuals. In an era of deficit and spending reductions, we should not cut taxes for those who least need a helping hand. The tax code can also be a key tool for poverty reduction, an important goal in a time when families are seeing their wages stagnate and their incomes fall. To tackle poverty, tax reform should include a permanent expansion of the earned income tax credit and an extension of the child tax credit to low-income families—two tax policies that increase the take-home pay for those hardest hit by the recession. Corporate tax reform is also needed, but politically difficult since corporations with a vested interest in the preference-laden status-quo are likely to throw their lobbying power against change. Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center notes that a few deeply entrenched preferences, including popular investment and research incentives, account for the overwhelming majority of corporate tax expenditures; relatively little low hanging fruit is there for the picking. Nevertheless, reform should address the imbalance between corporate and individual taxes—over the last half century, corporate income tax revenue as a share of the economy has plunged from 4.1% of gross domestic product in 1960 to just 1.3% of GDP and is projected to average only 2.0% over the next decade. Individual income and social insurance taxes, meanwhile, have risen from 10.6% of GDP in 1960 to 12.2% in 2010. Some policymakers say that we should use most or all of the revenue from loophole elimination to lower overall rates. However, at a time when core investments and priorities are being slashed from the budget but corporate profits are on the rise, why should we exempt corporations from their responsibilities? While curbing wasteful and regressive tax expenditures is a necessary first step, comprehensive tax reform will also require raising revenue from new sources, such as fees on the financial sector or revenues from efforts to combat global climate change. It has been 25 years since the last major tax reform effort; another overhaul is overdue. But times have changed,and we need to adjust our goals accordingly. Comprehensive tax reform should seek to raise more revenue, improve equity, and lay the foundation for stronger economic growth. Cleaning the tax code would free resources for deficit reduction, public investments, and other pro-growth tax incentives. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The tax code is overdue for reform, as it is outdated, unfair, and overly complicated, and raising inadequate resources to deal with national problems and priorities. However, a 1986-style reform would not be suitable for today's circumstances. Today, there is a need for more revenue due to projected future deficits, and growing income equality calls for a reevaluation of tax code fairness. A well-designed tax reform could address these issues while simplifying the tax code for individuals and businesses. Proposals for tax reform include capping itemized deductions at a fixed flat rate and converting some deductions to refundable tax credits. It is essential to address regressive and costly tax expenditures and to improve fairness in the tax code. Expanding the earned income tax credit and extending the child tax credit to low-income families would be crucial in tackling poverty. Corporate tax reform is also needed but faces political challenges. Comprehensive tax reform should focus on raising more revenue, improving equity, and promoting stronger economic growth."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"where is husqvarna 235 made?\\" A:","output":"Before answering the question, I need to gather some information about the Husqvarna 235, specifically related to its manufacturing location.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The widespread adoption of electric cars can potentially have a significant effect on reducing the trapped heat radiation in the Earth's atmosphere caused by human activities. If more cars that run on electricity are used, the burning of fossil fuels will decrease, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This in turn will lessen the amount of heat radiation trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As a result, there will be a more balanced heat radiation exchange between the Earth and space. By increasing the use of electric cars, we are effectively promoting a shift from fossil fuel-powered transportation to a more sustainable and clean energy source. Electricity can be generated from various renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which have considerably lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. This transition supports the goal of mitigating the effects of human-induced climate change by reducing our overall carbon footprint. Here is a more detailed breakdown of how the widespread adoption of electric cars might influence the reduction in trapped heat radiation: 1. Less combustion of fossil fuels: Conventional cars rely on combustion engines that burn fossil fuels to generate power, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Electric cars, on the other hand, do not require fuel combustion and produce zero direct tailpipe emissions. This shift reduces the overall greenhouse gas emissions responsible for trapping heat radiation. 2. Energy efficiency: Electric vehicles are generally more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. This means that electric cars can travel longer distances using less energy, reducing the total energy consumption and associated emissions. 3. Cleaner electricity generation: The environmental benefits of electric cars depend heavily on the sources of electricity utilized for charging. As the global shift towards cleaner and renewable energy sources continues, the carbon intensity of the electricity grid will decrease. This will result in even further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and, consequently, trapped heat radiation. 4. Indirect emissions reduction: Beyond the direct emissions reductions, electric cars can also contribute to indirect emissions reductions by helping to balance the electricity grid. By employing smart charging solutions and vehicle-to-grid technology, electric cars can store and release energy to the grid when needed, optimizing grid usage and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. In conclusion, the adoption of electric cars has the potential to reduce the trapped heat radiation by lowering greenhouse gas emissions arising from the burning of fossil fuels in transportation. The actual extent of this reduction might depend on various factors, such as the energy sources used for electricity generation and the pace of global transition to renewable energy sources. However, it is evident that electric vehicles can positively contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film is set in London in June 1911. George V will be crowned king on 22 June and in the preceding days many important dignitaries arrive. Among those arriving are the 16-year-old King Nicholas VIII of Carpathia, with his Prince Regent father, Charles (Laurence Olivier), a secondary Prince of Hungary and widower of the Queen of Carpathia. The British government realises that keeping Balkan country Carpathia in the Triple Entente is critical during the rising tensions in Europe. They find it necessary to pamper the royals during their stay in London, and thus civil servant Northbrook (Richard Wattis), is detached to their service. Northbrook decides to take the Prince Regent out to the musical performance The Coconut Girl. During the intermission the Prince Regent is taken backstage to meet the cast. He is particularly uninterested in engaging with the male actors and extremely interested in the physical charms of Elsie Marina (Marilyn Monroe), one of the performers, and sends a formal written invitation for her to meet him at the Carpathian embassy for supper. Elsie arrives at the embassy and is soon joined by the Prince Regent, a stiff and pompous man. She expects a large party but quickly realises the Prince's true intentions â to seduce her over a private supper. She is persuaded not to leave early by Northbrook, who promises to provide an excuse for her to escape after supper. The Prince Regent turns his back on her during the supper, taking phone calls and addressing matters of state. He then makes a clumsy pass at her, to which she is accustomed and immediately rebuffs.

In particular the Shiva Sutras, an auxiliary text to the Ashtadhyayi, introduces what can be considered a list of the phonemes of the Sanskrit language, with a notational system for them that is used throughout the main text, which deals with matters of morphology, syntax and semantics. What type of grammar was phonology first a part of?","output":"Phonology was first a part of morphophonemic grammar, which had its early roots in the Sanskrit grammar composed by Pāṇini. Morphophonemic grammar is a type of linguistic analysis that focuses on the relationship between phonology (the study of the sounds of a language and how they interact) and morphology (the study of the structure and formation of words). In Pāṇini's work on Sanskrit grammar, particularly in the Ashtadhyayi, phonology played a crucial role in understanding the language's structure and function. The Ashtadhyayi is an elaborate treatise on Sanskrit grammar that explores the intricacies of the language's morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects. Within this extensive work, Pāṇini introduced the Shiva Sutras, which served as an auxiliary text enumerating the phonemes of Sanskrit. The Shiva Sutras presented a notational system to represent these phonemes, which helped scholars understand the compositional rules and allowed them to analyze the phonological features of Sanskrit words and their transformations. Morphophonemic grammar, as it relates to phonology, is concerned with the ways phonemes (the smallest units of sound that differentiate meaning) can influence the morphological structure of words. This relationship helps to identify meaningful units within words and determine the rules governing their organization. Morphophonemic grammar also examines how phonemes and morphemes interact and change as words are formed and modified. In Pāṇini's work, the phonemes of Sanskrit were meticulously categorized, and their interactions within the language were analyzed. This early effort in understanding phonology and morphology led to the development of systematic and rule-based linguistic analysis, which in turn paved the way for future studies in phonology and other branches of linguistics. In summary, phonology was first a part of morphophonemic grammar, with its origins traceable to Pāṇini's work on Sanskrit grammar, specifically the Ashtadhyayi and the Shiva Sutras. Pāṇini's insights into the interplay between phonology and morphology laid the foundation for modern linguistic theories and continued exploration in the field of phonology."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

Along with need-it-now services like virtual check-in and grab-and-go meals, hotels are offering 12-minute exfoliation treatments and 10-minute massages for travelers who want their spa treatments in the time it takes to microwave garlic potatoes. No longer the purview of airports, lickety-split beauty and wellness treatments are augmenting the traditional spa menus at hotels and resorts. In the wake of the 2008 recession, many spas began offering shorter treatments for consumers who could no longer afford to indulge: Some 75 percent of spas added abbreviated treatments to their menus, according to the International Spa Association. The trend stuck, and appears to be taking on renewed significance at a time when beauty and wellness-on-demand apps like Glamsquad and Zeel allow people to book and receive massages, manicures, makeup applications and blowouts wherever they are — an Airbnb rental, an office building — with a few taps on a smartphone. Among the nascent players is JW Marriott Hotels and Resorts. The upscale chain is rolling out its Spa by JW concept with treatments that last 12 to 25 minutes and can be booked without an appointment. Treatments include scalp massages, shoulder massages and hand exfoliation and moisturizing, and are offered in chairs tricked out with scent infusers, noise canceling technology and smartphone charging stations. “It gives our travelers who honestly don’t have the time to do the full spa treatment the ability to refresh or calm down after a flight,” said Mitzi Gaskins, Marriott International’s vice president of luxury brand management. So far, Spa by JW is in a couple of hotels, including the new JW Marriott Houston Downtown and the JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar in India; some 25 spas are in the pipeline. Ms. Gaskins said the concept grew out of Marriott’s research, which included talking to avid spagoers around the world as well as guests who don’t usually frequent hotel spas. Some felt intimidated by the typical spa setup, which often includes a secluded location within a hotel, a seemingly aloof reception desk staff and undressing and putting on a robe. Spa by JW is designed to be in a busy area of a hotel; a kind of additional lounge for guests that also offers quick pick-me-up treatments that can be booked on a whim rather than reserved a week before. The 12-minute tension-release massage at the JW Marriott Houston Downtown, for example, is 25; the 90-minute deep-tissue intensive muscle release massage is 200. In December, Viceroy Snowmass in Colorado began offering its “ski-in/ski-out spa treatments” for skiers and snowboarders who want to spend a full day on the slopes but don’t mind pausing for a bit of pampering. Guests can ski right up to the spa, hand their skis and poles to a “ski valet,” and then take an elevator down to the spa for treatments that last 30 minutes. A Mediterranean lunch with healthful bites including hummus, olives and roasted vegetables is part of the package and may be eaten during the treatment — to save time, of course. The most popular treatment, according to Debbie Alcorta, the spa operations manager for Viceroy Snowmass, is “Kick Off Your Boots” (30 minutes; 95 for the treatment, lunch and gratuity), which includes a foot bath in warm water, a lemongrass mimosa scrub, cuticle grooming and a hot stone massage. And good news for those who want to rush back out to the slopes: You don’t even have to don a robe. “We can just roll up your ski pants and your little second-skins, do the treatment and get you on your way,” said Ms. Alcorta. Another treatment, “Warm Up Your Hands and Toes” (30 minutes; 95 for the treatment, lunch and gratuity) is a hydrating hand and foot therapy to combat dry winter skin that, like “Kick Off Your Boots,” is performed in a communal spa suite. Skiers can walk-in, ahem, ski-in, for appointments between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., or make a reservation for a specific time, Ms. Alcorta said. When they’re done they can use the rest of the spa facilities, including a relaxation lounge. “And then they can get back on the slopes,” she said. While not every hotel spa is quite so convenient, a number have “express” menus, like the 21c Museum Hotel in Cincinnati, which offers 30-minute Swedish massages (75), pedicures (45) and facials (85). There’s also a 10-minute massage called the “See You in Ten” (25). At the same time, on-demand beauty and wellness services that send stylists and therapists to people’s homes or vacation rentals are becoming more popular. Zeel offers appointments every day of the year (holidays, too) in more than a dozen cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Washington. A recent search showed that a therapist who could come to Midtown Manhattan to give an hourlong Swedish massage, for example, would cost 130 before 18 percent gratuity (automatically added to the bill) and tax, for a total of 159.25. The company recently introduced Zeel Concierge, a service that allows hotels and spas to book appointments that they normally couldn’t because of, say, a guest’s last-minute request or a lack of staffing. Now hotel concierges and spa staff can book appointments using Zeel massage therapists (who the company says are licensed and undergo background checks), according to Spafinder Wellness, an industry marketing and media group. It’s little wonder Zeel and similar services with apps such as Soothe, StyleBee and Glamsquad are finding success in the age of Uber, when immediacy and personalization are prized. “Sometimes a busy schedule only leaves an hour between work and a night on the town to get rested and beautiful,” says a new report by Spafinder Wellness 365. “Customers are increasingly willing to forgo the experience of a spa — or at least periodically complement it — in exchange for the convenience and flexibility of wellness on-demand.” Is the 90-minute massage doomed? Hardly. Luxury hotels and resorts continue to introduce hour-plus treatments for those who want to spend the afternoon slathered in olive oil body butter, or have a deep-pore cleansing. But it’s now easier than ever to get a quick fix, whether you just stepped off a plane or a ski slope.

Los Angeles International Speedway in California. A:","output":"Title: Breakneck Rivals Genre: Action, Thriller, Sports Plot: In the heart of Los Angeles, California, the city is electrified with anticipation for the ultimate race event of the century - The LA Tie-Breaker Grand Prix, a prestigious no-holds-barred street race that takes place at Los Angeles International Speedway. In the middle of it all are two rival racers, Jake Matthews and Max \\"Maverick\\" Kingston, who have been at loggerheads for years, each leading their respective racing teams, The Red Thunder and The Silver Streakers. Both teams have tied for first place and are itching to claim the trophy and the million-dollar cash prize. The movie begins with Jake, an undeniably talented racer, driven by his desire to honor the memory of his late father, a legendary racer who tragically died during the same event ten years ago. Jake is determined to win the race in his father's name and continue the racing legacy within his family. On the opposite end, Max \\"Maverick\\" Kingston, who comes from a wealthy and influential background, is not only aiming to win for fame, fortune, and status but also to seek revenge on Jake's family, as he believes that it was Jake's father who had caused the accident that cost his own father's racing career. As the days leading up to the race come close, both teams engage in fierce competition, trying to sabotage each other within the confines of the law, and attempting to gain an upper hand in the upcoming event. Both racers also have their own dedicated crew and a supportive group of friends working tirelessly to ensure their victory. Jake has his beloved fiancée, Laura, who is an expert mechanic and proficient in managing the business side of the Red Thunder team. Max, on the other hand, relies heavily on his cunning and resourceful childhood friend, Leo. Tensions rise between Jake and Max when their egos escalate a bar brawl that results in Max being arrested, causing the Silver Streakers to lose their lead in the championship. Once Max is released on bail, he doubles down on his vendetta against Jake and his team abruptly changes their approach to winning. Max decides to use his wealth and connections to poach a world-renowned engineer to develop game-changing technology for his racing vehicle in a bid to overshadow the Red Thunder team. As the race day arrives, both teams are neck and neck at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Roaring engines, screaming fans, and a heightened sense of determination have engulfed the atmosphere. The race begins, and the audience bears witness to some of the most thrilling driving maneuvers, strategic pit stops, and high-speed risks ever seen. The movie takes the audience on the edge-of-their-seat high-speed adrenaline pushes as the rivals push their physical and mental boundaries. However, during the climax of the race, a devastating accident occurs, almost identical to the one that had claimed Jake's father's life. In a pivotal character-defining moment, Jake gives up his lead to save Max from the wreckage, proving that friendship and sportsmanship hold a higher value over victory and personal vendetta. In the aftermath of the race, both Jake and Max find a newfound respect for each other, with Max finally realizing that winning the race at any cost was never the true path to success. The movie concludes with both teams celebrating together on the podium, symbolizing unity in the racing community and the triumph of sportsmanship. Although it may not have been the outcome either team had initially expected, the LA Tie-Breaker Grand Prix had truly become a race that nobody would forget. \\"Breakneck Rivals\\" is a thrilling, action-packed, heart-pumping movie that encapsulates the true spirit of racing alongside the importance of sportsmanship, teamwork, and family. In the end, nobody could have predicted that the most memorable race in the history of the Los Angeles International Speedway would be one where rivals become allies, and the true victory lies beyond the finish line."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"Step 1: Decide on a simple sentence to translate into Spanish.

This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - Coast Guard Station Cobb Island is a former United States Coast Guard station that was built on the southern end of Cobb Island in 1936 . It was decommissioned in 1964 and sold to the Nature Conservancy in 1973 . In 1998 , it was relocated to Oyster , VA on Virginia 's Eastern Shore and restored by the Nature Conservancy . It is currently owned by the World Healing Institute . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A regulatory agency (also regulatory authority, regulatory body or regulator) is a public authority or government agency responsible for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory or supervisory capacity. An independent regulatory agency is a regulatory agency that is independent from other branches or arms of the government. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.

Her goal for the entire year is to cut her coffee spending by 25%. How much will she save? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. Determine her current weekly spending on coffee. 2. Determine her current annual spending on coffee. 3. Calculate her target annual spending after the 25% reduction. 4. Calculate the difference between her current and target annual spending to find the savings. Step 1: Determine her current weekly spending on coffee. - Martha buys 1 latte for 4 every morning, 5 days a week: 5 days * 4 = 20 on lattes per week. - Martha buys an iced coffee for 2, 3 days a week: 3 days * 2 = 6 on iced coffee per week. - Add both weekly costs: 20 + 6 = 26 per week on coffee. Step 2: Determine her current annual spending on coffee. - There are 52 weeks in a year, so multiply her weekly spending by the number of weeks: 26 * 52 = 1,352 annual spending on coffee. Step 3: Calculate her target annual spending after the 25% reduction. - To reduce her spending by 25%, we need to find what 75% of her current spending would be: 75% * 1,352 = 0.75 * 1,352 = 1,014. Step 4: Calculate the difference between her current and target annual spending to find the savings. - Subtract the target annual spending from the current annual spending to find her savings: 1,352 - 1,014 = 338.

He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. and a hint : Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. Please answer this question : In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? A:","output":"In case B, the number of mesopredators would likely be more than in case A. This is because case B represents a decrease in Siberian tiger population due to the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century. The Siberian tigers are apex predators, and their population decrease would lead to a release of mesopredators (carnivores that eat other carnivores) in the ecosystem due to the removal of the top-level predator. This phenomenon is known as mesopredator release and can be observed in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. With fewer apex predators to control them, mesopredators can often increase in number and expand their range."},{"instruction":"Choose from: (a). Avoid the busiest months. (b).

Article: There are plenty of different parks to visit in the UK. All theme parks in Britain have cafes, restaurants, picnic areas and gift shops, so you'll still have plenty to see and do when you and the kids have been on enough rides. There are usually smaller \\"funfair\\" rides and games as well, so younger children won't get bored. Several theme parks also have other attractions next to them, e.g. water parks often open all year round, unlike the theme parks. Wherever you are in Britain, there's likely to be a theme park within one or two hours' drive, bus ride or train journey. Several theme parks even have accommodation so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year! If you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets.

It's a quest that may not require you to speak aloud until a recruiter reaches out — if they ever do. That solitary, slow experience is one reason why ZipRecruiter, an online job site, has created an app for Amazon Echo that encourages users to say: \\"Alexa, find me a job.\\" Launched Thursday, ZipRecruiter's app allows job seekers to ask Amazon's voice assistant Alexa what jobs are available, gather more information about the positions, and apply to them (if they have a resume on file). The app is the first for job applications on Echo, a system that already allows users to pay bills and book flights via a black cylinder with voice recognition. \\"Conversational [design] is not perfect for a number of industries, but there's something that makes it extra magical for us,\\" Jen Ringel, ZipRecruiter's director of product, told Mashable. \\"Voice in a way is humanizing the job search.\\" To search for jobs, Echo owners do not need to create an account or log-in on ZipRecruiter. They can simply download the app and start talking to Alexa. The app knows a handful of commands, including, \\"Alexa, tell ZipRecruiter, I hate my boss,\\" which will then prompt a response about a job search. The Echo integration is the latest project Ringel and Sara Siegal, a software engineer at ZipRecruiter, have been working on to make the job search more conversational. Even though it’s not a real human, it still becomes more of a human experience \\"Part of the reason why job search is so stressful cause you’re really putting yourself out there. You go for a job you hope you’re qualified for, you think you’re qualified for and then you send it off and guess what: silence,\\" Ringel said. The team recently released a chatbot for Facebook Messenger and have seen job seekers apply to twice as many jobs through the system compared to other methods. With Amazon's Alexa, Ringel and Siegal said they hope people will feel even more comfortable finding and applying to jobs. \\"Even though it’s not a real human, it still becomes more of a human experience,\\" Siegal said. Ringel and Siegal both own Echo devices and casually converse with them, including testing jeopardy skills and learning cat facts. For now, Echo owners can only hear about and apply to jobs with the ZipRecruiter app, but they plan to build more features in the coming months.

But now Hungarian musician Gergely Boganyi claims to have reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £1million building his own in a workshop in Budapest. With its edgy design, finished entirely in glossy black paint, music fans have dubbed the creation the Batpiano - for its resemblance to the Batmobile. Scroll down for video. Gergely Boganyi, 41, has spent ten years, 8,000 hours and almost £1million redesigning the grand piano in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory in Hungary. Bogyani has replaced most of the traditional wood with carbon fibre, designed two legs which act as sound deflectors to project music, and redesigned the key mechanism. Viewers of the new creation at a premiere event in Budapest earlier this month described the instrument as a Batpiano - because its angular body and black pain resemble the Batmobile. It is certainly futuristic, doing away with most of the wood traditionally used in grand pianos such as the Steinway, and replacing it with cutting-edge carbon fibre. Almost every single one of the instrument's 18,000 components has been redesigned. Rather than the traditional three legs, the Boganyi has only two, and both of them have been carefully shaped to help project the sound into the auditorium. He had also reinvented the key mechanism, meaning it applies only the slightest pressure to the soundboard - the anchor of the piano to which everything else is fixed. The board itself, instead of being made from the traditional wood, is made from more than 20 carbon composite layers woven one on top of the other. Boganyi, 41, a feted concert pianist who has spent more than a decade building the instrument in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory, is optimistic about the results. He said: 'What we created will enrich piano history. It is said that old pianos sound friendly, velvety, while new ones are stronger and more powerful. I was hoping for both.' The piano traces its history back to the dulcimer, an instrument made of strings stretched across a board played with hand-held hammers, which was invented in Iran shortly after the birth of Christ. However, the first modern piano was created by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori in Florence, Italy, in 1709 and was called gravicembalo col piano e forte - which roughly translates as 'harpsichord with soft and loud'. Boganyi won his first music prize at the age of six, and has gone on to play as a soloist in some of the most critically acclaimed orchestras in the world, including the London Philharmonic in 2004. Boganyi says that, unlike other modern redesigns such as though sponsored by Peugeot and Audi, his was focused entirely on the sound, rather than the appearance. Following a premiere concert in Budapest on Wednesday this week, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much it will cost yet, but says 'it will be expensive' It was designed to improve upon the harpsichord, the favoured instrument of Bach and Handel, which produced notes by plucking at strings, rather than striking them. The plucking action meant that the harpsichord was only capable of producing one flat tone, while the piano's hammer action meant the tone varied depending on how hard the key was struck. During the late 18th century, around the time Beethoven was playing, craftsmen added more keys to the instrument, as well as the first pedals to dampen or sustain notes. The suit the new styles of playing, the hammers were made heavier, and the strings stronger, producing a powerful new sound. Makers also experimented with upright versions, with the strings stretched vertically in front of the player, and square grand pianos. The last great period of invention came in the mid to late 1800s, when Steinway & Sons developed their grand piano, and added a third pedal underneath. But now Boganyi, who won his first music prize aged six and performs as a soloist in acclaimed orchestras such as the London Philharmonic, is hoping to add to that history with his latest version. He says the new instrument is based on innovations dreamed up, but not widely used, by 19th-century Hungarian piano makers. The instrument's soundboard, the central fitting to which all other parts are fixed, has been refashioned out of 20 layers of carbon composite woven together giving the piano a lighter, airier sound. Jazz pianist Gerald Clayton described playing the new piano as like being 'in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity (pictured, Boganyi plays the piano in his workshop) Boganyi and his design team are pictured with the new piano in their workshop in Szigethalom. And it seems that it could have been worth the wait as expert piano players agreed that the sound it produces is entirely new. Karoly Reisinger, CEO of New York piano repair shop Klavierhaus, was 'mesmerized at the sound he said brought lyrical qualities back to the piano after a century of power-focused development. He said: 'In this design you will be able to hear the 1850-1860 era qualities, lyrical, bell-like, precise – and also the modern instrument that our time is used to, which is clarity.' Four-time Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gerald Clayton said he felt he had played a slick new type of instrument. He added: 'The sound almost feels as if you're in a bubble, it's so clear. It feels like you are in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity. 'When you play a lot of notes, or you play a chord, the sensation is different. It's super-clear.' Following a premiere in the Grand Concert Hall in Budapest earlier this month, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much each one will cost yet, but he says 'with these materials it will not be cheap.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Hungarian musician Gergely Boganyi has reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £1 million building his own in a workshop in Budapest. 2.

The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation.

Answer:","output":"Yes, both Cordoba Fighting Dog and Portuguese Water Dog are examples of dog breeds, but they have very different origins, purposes, and characteristics. The Cordoba Fighting Dog, also known as the Cordobes or Perro de Pelea Cordobes, originated in the city of Cordoba in Argentina. This breed was primarily developed for dog fighting and was known for its ferocity, strength, and endurance. The Cordoba Fighting Dog was a mix of multiple breeds, primarily the Bull Terrier, Mastiff, Boxer, and Bulldog. It was an aggressive and fearless breed, which unfortunately led to its eventual extinction. The last known Cordoba Fighting Dog was reported in the 1960s. In contrast, the Portuguese Water Dog, also known as the Cão de Água Português, is a breed that hails from Portugal. This breed was originally developed to assist fishermen in their work. Portuguese Water Dogs are intelligent, obedient, and easily trained. Their primary tasks included herding fish into nets, retrieving broken nets or lost fishing gear, and even serving as couriers between boats or from boats to shore. The physical traits of these two breeds are also different. Cordoba Fighting Dogs were muscular, with a strong and powerful build, relatively short coat, and a large head. They were medium-sized dogs that weighed between 30-45 kg (66-99 pounds) and stood around 50-60 cm (20-24 inches) at the shoulder. Their coat colors varied, but brindle and fawn were common. The breed's physical appearance was aimed at enhancing its fighting abilities, with its broad chest, powerful legs, and large strong jaw. Portuguese Water Dogs, on the other hand, are also medium-sized dogs, weighing between 16-27 kg (35-60 pounds) and standing 43-57 cm (17-22 inches) at the shoulder. They have a distinct curly or wavy coat that is water-resistant and makes them well-suited for their aquatic tasks. Coat colors can range from black, brown, or white, as well as combinations of these colors. One of their most distinguishing features is the presence of webbed feet, which aids in their swimming abilities. Their overall appearance reflects their working nature and adaptability to water. In summary, both Cordoba Fighting Dog and Portuguese Water Dog are examples of dog breeds, but with vastly different origins, purposes, and physical characteristics. The Cordoba Fighting Dog was bred for aggressive dog-fighting activities and is now an extinct breed, while the Portuguese Water Dog has a long history as a working dog assisting fishermen and remains a popular breed today."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: On the night of 6 November 1995, a fire broke out in the Rova compound, destroying or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On the night of the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred at a time when the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured motivations for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven.

As the demand for the products in the market exceeded the products available, option a: demand was too high while the supply of products could not keep up. This discrepancy resulted in a number of issues for both consumers and producers. For consumers, this meant facing a potential shortage of the desired products that met their needs and preferences. Often, this led to increased prices as the level of competition among buyers further intensified. The limited product availability prompted consumers to seek alternatives or even postpone purchases altogether, hoping to wait for the market to stabilize. On the other hand, businesses experienced a growing pressure to ramp up production and meet the demand, which prompted them to reassess their production capacity, efficiency, and workforce. As a result, companies looking to increase output turned to hire additional workers, invest in state-of-the-art technology, or streamline their operational processes to achieve optimum efficiency. Meanwhile, organizations focused on improving their production quality and effectiveness to maintain customer loyalty, knowing that consumers would likely pay a premium price for the products they sought after in the market. In this situation, the high demand for products might have resulted in an atmosphere of innovation, as companies sought to find new solutions to meet the pressing demand. In some cases, this might have led to the introduction of new products or services that adequately addressed consumer needs, thus expanding the market offerings and providing consumers with even more options. However, despite the potential for growth and innovation, the sustained high demand and lack of supply in the market could also generate negative consequences. One possible outcome might involve an increase in fraudulent activities, such as counterfeit products or false advertising, in an attempt to exploit customers and their willingness to pay a higher price for scarce products. Such illicit activities could, in turn, damage the credibility and trust of the market, prompting consumers to become more skeptical of the offerings in the market. Additionally, an unchecked demand-supply imbalance could lead to economic instability, as continual price hikes and market fluctuations might deter investment and disrupt long-term planning for businesses and households alike. Consequently, governments and other regulatory authorities may need to step in and intervene through implementing strategic measures, such as price controls, incentives for increasing production or importation of goods, or even consumer education campaigns to raise awareness of the potential risks tied to scarcity and high demand. In conclusion, when the demand for products in a market far exceeds the available supply, as in this case, it can pose several challenges and consequences for both consumers and businesses. Swift actions to address this demand-supply imbalance, either by increasing production or exploring alternative solutions, may be crucial in maintaining a stable and thriving market that is conducive to long-term growth and prosperity."},{"instruction":"Heroinandotherharddrugsevenmoreso.Nearlyallwhobecomehookedontheharddrugsstartedonmarijuana.

The answer is high school students and struggling writers. There are around 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the US, and every year a mind-boggling 3bn fortune cookies are manufactured and consumed. Each cookie needs a fortune line buried in its shell. Kay Marshall Strom, 65, was a high school senior when she saw a little blurb in the local San Francisco newspaper asking for a fortune writer. Intrigued, she sent an inquiry – she had been contemplating becoming a writer when she grew up and figured, why not start small? She got the job. Inspiration for the fortunes was everywhere – movies, walks outside, time spent with friends – and Strom would jot down ideas as they occurred to her throughout the day. The job lasted an entire year, and every few weeks, she would send batches of new fortunes to the company for approval. The company skewed conservative, and some of her more creative and offbeat ideas got shot down. One idea that did make it through though became infamous: “You will be hungry again in an hour.” Despite the years that have passed since Strom spent her after-school hours playing fortune teller, many of her compositions remain in print, and she still finds her own witticisms from time to time in cookies. Others don’t have such fond memories of their fortune-writing experiences. Russell Rowland, who was a struggling writer when he got his freelance fortune gig, is one of them. “One of the funniest things about this whole thing is … I can’t stand fortune cookies. I think they are horrible,” he said with a laugh. But the cookies gave him a sort of start in publishing. Since sitting down to compose fortunes at 75 cents each back in 2000, he has published four books. When he took his turn as the sage of Chinese food fans, Rowland was given no guidelines, just a firm number: 700 fortunes. So he turned to literature – specifically, a book of famous quotations called Great Thoughts. Other times, he would come up with a good phrase, like “Love is the secret to happiness”, and then plug in other words to get extra mileage out of a single idea. While it may seem easy to write one-line predictions, there is a lot more art to fortune-writing than meets the eye. They have to be general enough to make sense for any kind of customer, but at the same time, they can’t offend anyone – which means a lot of the more fun fortunes have to fall by the wayside in favor of the bland. The fortunes that survive must make sense for the grandmother who goes to church seven times a week, for her six-year-old grandson, and for his wild-at-heart teenage babysitter all at the same time. So forget telling people they will meet a tall, dark and handsome stranger. The sheer number of fortunes needed is another obstacle. Companies keep databases of thousands of fortunes accumulated over years that they rotate on a regular basis to keep people from getting the same ones over and over. Coming up with original ideas when there are already 10,000 in the database – as there are, for example, at cookie manufacturer Wonton Foods – is a real challenge. The job also has more responsibility than just providing a few chuckles or a smile after dinner. Some people take fortune cookies very seriously. Forums exist to discuss how to make the fortune inside come true. People collect the fortunes, tape them to their work desks and home fridges, and tuck them into their wallets as a reminder to have hope. A childhood friend used to always eat the little slip of paper, assuring me that if she literally internalized it, her fortune would come to fruition. That level of wishful thinking isn’t limited to weird kids with a taste for paper. In 2005, there were 110 second-prize winners in the Powerball lottery, prompting an investigation which uncovered that all 110 people had played the “lucky” numbers on the back of their fortune (it is worth noting that unlike the fortunes, those numbers are computer-generated). Erin Jump Fry, CEO of Fancy Fortune Cookies, said the incredible lasting power of the fortune cookie boils down to its ability to surprise us when so few things can any more. She would know: in addition to printing messages in her cookies for birth announcements, wedding favors and teens asking each other to prom, she once had a client ask her to slip an actual engagement ring into a fortune cookie. No word on if the bride tried to eat it, tape it to her fridge or put it in her wallet, as tradition dictates. Summary:","output":"High school students and struggling writers are often behind the creation of fortunes found in fortune cookies distributed in Chinese restaurants across the US. Approximately three billion fortune cookies are manufactured and consumed every year, each requiring a fortune statement. These creators often find inspiration from a variety of sources, ranging from popular movies to famous quotations. The fortunes must be generalized to suit all types of customers and avoid offensive content. As a result, more creative ideas are usually rejected in favor of safer alternatives. Companies maintain databases of thousands of fortunes to prevent repetition, providing a challenge for writers to come up with original ideas."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"what may be different especially if the tree is big\\" Context: \\"Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature.

After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release.

However, the soldier reportedly changed his mind after being informed that the raid was broadcasted live on television. The footage captured from the back of the embassy was being transmitted by a wireless camera that had been secretly installed by ITN technicians, who posed as guests of a local resident to bypass the police cordon.

He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should...

The chain of thought and solution for this question is as follows: 1. Consider the context of the statement: It mentions that a majority (90%) of civilians drive a Tank to work. Tanks are military vehicles designed for battle, not for civilian use or daily transportation. 2. Analyze the feasibility: Tanks are expensive to produce, maintain, and operate. They consume massive amounts of fuel and have limited mobility in urban settings. Civilians typically use cars, buses, bicycles, or other modes of public transportation for their daily commute. 3. Investigate actual facts: Official data and statistics from various countries show that the majority of civilian populations use regular vehicles or public transport systems for commuting. There's no evidence or data supporting that such a large percentage of civilians use tanks as their primary mode of transportation for work. 4. Verify the legality: In most countries, it's illegal for civilians to own or operate military vehicles like tanks without proper licensing and authorization, making the statement even more implausible. Based on these points, the statement is not factual."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Sandra drop in the water?

Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 09:30 EST, 16 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 09:50 EST, 16 March 2014. The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a spectacular winter haven for hundreds of thousands of water birds. But this year's bitterly cold season has made it notable for something else: dead ducks.Biologists say carcasses began piling up by the hundreds in early January after the plunging temperatures started icing over nearly the entire Great Lakes, preventing the ducks from getting to the minnows that are their main source of food. Necropsies on dozens of birds have confirmed the cause: starvation.'All have empty stomachs. They're half the weight they should be,' said Connie Adams, a biologist in the state Department of Environmental Conservation's Buffalo office who has personally seen 950 dead birds. A dead red-breasted merganser duck sits on an examine table at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday. Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines a dead red-breasted merganser duck at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday. 'This is unprecedented. Biologists who've worked here for 35 years have never seen anything like this,' she said. 'We've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts.' It's a phenomenon that has been seen elsewhere along the Great Lakes, with news reports of diving ducks and other waterfowl turning up dead by the hundreds along the southern part of Lake Michigan. They've also been found in Lake St. Clair between Lakes Erie and Huron. 'It's a hard winter for ducks, like everything else,' said Russ Mason, wildlife director with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Necropsies and toxicity analyses showed many of the Michigan ducks were subsisting on invasive zebra mussels, which caused the birds to have potentially toxic levels of selenium in their bodies, Mason said. Zebra mussels filter toxins from the water and pass them up the food chain. Most of the dead ducks seen in the upstate New York are red-breasted mergansers, which breed in northern Canada and Alaska and come south for the winter to the Great Lakes region. In most years, there are periods of freezing and thawing, providing enough breaks in the ice for them to dive for minnows. But this winter, it's been so bitterly cold for so long that the ice had pushed across 92.2 percent of the Great Lakes' surface area earlier this month, according to federal monitors, just short of the record 94.7 percent set in 1979. Biologists say the Niagara River also. has ice extending up to 100 yards off shore, creating a shelf where. minnows and shiners can hide. The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a winter haven for water birds. There is evidence some waterfowl gave up and tried to fly farther south but were too weak to do so. Dead birds have been seen along shorelines, on docks and on the ice, their carcasses feasted upon by gulls and bald eagles. Two weeks ago, Adams said, there were 240,000 water birds in her area's weekly count. Last week, there were 43,000. It's unknown how many birds - which also included such species as scaup, canvasbacks and grebes - migrated elsewhere and how many died.At the DEC's Wildlife Health Unit near Albany, biologist Joe Okoniewski has refrigerators stuffed with bags of red-breasted mergansers sent by wildlife biologists on Lakes Erie and Ontario. The diving ducks are black and white with a rusty speckled breast, orange bill and an iridescent green head with a shaggy crest on the back. 'The skin is stuck tight to the body wall because there's no layer of fat underneath,' Okoniewski said, running a scalpel along the breastbone of a dead merganser. The gizzard and intestine were empty, except for a few normal parasites.'I've seen a couple with stomachs full of feathers and feathers all the way down through their intestines,' Okoniewski said. 'They're desperate for anything to eat. It's really sad.' Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines the ducks who he says died of starvation. Unlike mallard or black ducks, mergansers won't eat bread or other food people may offer. They only eat live fish. While the bird deaths are a natural event that can be documented but not changed, wildlife rehabilitators are trying to save birds that people find near death in snowbanks and parking lots. 'We've had over 160 since the beginning of January,' said Dawn Mazierski, a wildlife technician at the Erie County SPCA in Tonawanda. 'We have to tube-feed them a liquid diet three to four times a day until they're strong enough to eat on their own.' The birds, which spend all their time on water, can hardly walk, and often their natural waterproofing is damaged by dirt or road salt so they can't swim either. 'They soak up water like a sponge and sink,' Mazierski said. So the birds rest in a quiet room on net hammocks called loon beds, preening their feathers back to condition. When they're ready, they go into tubs of water stocked with minnows donated by bait shops. 'A merganser can eat 200 to 250 fish per day,' Mazierski said. 'We go through thousands of fish a day.' After anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks, the birds are ready for release. 'Once their weight has increased and they're real spunky, and we have a decent weather day, we take them back out,' Mazierski said. 'And we hope they'll find enough food to bulk up for their flight north in spring.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Given the context: How would Aubrey feel afterwards? Possible answers: angry, excited, upset Answer:","output":"After suiting up for her karate class, Aubrey would likely feel excited. The process of getting dressed for a class or activity often serves as a mental and physical preparation, allowing the individual to transition from their everyday life into a more focused and energized mindset. Karate, as a martial art, encourages discipline, self-improvement, and confidence. These positive characteristics often translate into positive emotions and overall well-being. Aubrey might be eager to engage with her classmates, learn new techniques, and challenge herself physically and mentally in the class. The supportive environment found in many martial arts schools fosters a sense of camaraderie, respect, and belonging among classmates. This can also contribute to her feelings of excitement and anticipation. Besides the emotional and psychological benefits, the physical exertion involved in karate can create an adrenaline rush, which can further boost Aubrey's excitement. This is due to the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkiller, that also triggers feelings of happiness and satisfaction. While it's possible for Aubrey to feel a range of emotions throughout the class, from frustration at not grasping a technique right away to pride in mastering a new move, the predominant feeling of excitement is most likely. It is important to note that participation in sports and physical activities generally improves mental well-being by reducing stress, increasing energy levels, and releasing feel-good hormones. Although the other emotional responses mentioned - angry and upset - are possible in various situations, they are less likely given the context of Aubrey suiting up for karate class. Considering that she has made the effort to attend class and is preparing herself for the session, it suggests that she is motivated and has a positive attitude towards the activity. Anger and frustration may arise if, for example, she faces a major challenge or setback, but these emotions would likely be temporary and not overshadow the overarching excitement and satisfaction she experiences from engaging in karate."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: I enjoyed this movie very much Product review: I would recommend this movie to all folks that like holiday movies.

A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes.

Though Tracy's cardiac arrest remains a mystery, the doctors and nurses fought against the clock to revive her. Simultaneously, others focused on Coltyn, who had also been deprived of oxygen. They knew that with every passing second, the chances of permanent damage or even death for the fragile infant only grew worse. The rapid and coordinated response of the medical personnel would be crucial in determining the ultimate outcome for mother and child.

From the second half of the 14th century until the early 17th, Tibet was ruled by competing Buddhist schools. However, it was during this period that the Gelug order was founded in 1409 and the institution of the Dalai Lama was established in 1569 with the priest-patron relationship between the Altan Khan and the 3rd Dalai Lama .

When the energy from the Earth's crust is released, it travels through the Earth's layers as seismic waves. These waves cause the ground to shake, resulting in an earthquake. The shaking can cause damage to structures, trigger landslides, tsunamis, and other secondary effects, depending on the intensity, depth, and location of the earthquake. Overall, the process consists of: 1. Energy build-up in the Earth's crust: Stress accumulates in the Earth's crust due to the slow movement of tectonic plates. 2. Fault lines give way: As the stress surpasses the strength of the rock, a fault rupture occurs, releasing the accumulated energy. 3. Earth's plates move: The release of energy causes the tectonic plates to shift and slide past each other. 4.

(Associated Press) Women walk past a group of construction workers gathered on the street during their lunch break Thursday, Oct. 28, 2010, in New York. Although these men did not harass any of the passersby, a New York... (Associated Press) A City Council committee heard testimony Thursday from women who said men regularly follow them, yell at them and make them feel unsafe and uncomfortable. Advocates told stories of preteens and teenagers being hounded by adult men outside city schools and pleaded for government to address the problem. \\"This is not our way of not being able to take a compliment,\\" said Nefertiti Martin, who testified at the hearing. \\"This is an issue of safety.\\" Street harassment of women is as old as cities themselves and is common around the world, but the pushback against it is a more recent movement. Volunteer activists in Cairo are planning to launch a website, Harrasmap, where women can instantly report cases of leering, groping and other sexual threats. Soon, the group Hollaback, an organization formed five years ago to stand up to street harassment, will release a smart phone app allowing women everywhere to do the same. Hollaback told councilmembers that women have left jobs, broken leases and skipped school all just to avoid incessant unwelcome advances from strange men they pass on their commutes. Holly Kearl, author of \\"Stop Street Harassment: Making Public Places Safe and Welcoming for Women,\\" said she informally surveyed more than 800 women from 23 countries and 43 states, and 99 percent of them had been harassed by strangers. \\"Because of street harassment, from a young age women learn that public spaces are male territory,\\" Kearl said. \\"They learn to limit the places they go, they try not to be in public alone _ especially at night _ and when they are alone, they stay on guard.\\" Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, chair of the women's issues committee that held the hearing Thursday, recalled learning as a young teen how to \\"speedwalk\\" to dodge certain men, and which corner stores she should always avoid. \\"This harassment limits the rights and freedoms of women and girls to enjoy a simple walk outside,\\" she said. The Associated Press heard similar stories from New York City women. Kat Pope, 28, of Manhattan, said she quit going to her gym in the mornings because she was harassed so badly on her way there and back. Men at a construction site would whistle, stare and yell at her as she passed, every single day. She still gets harassed in other locations, but it happens maybe once a week instead of daily. \\"It feels disgusting,\\" she said. \\"In the moment, I feel helpless and I never know what to do to make it stop.\\" Carrie Goodman, 27, a student who lives in Manhattan, said she hears a whistle or comment \\"once or twice a day.\\" \\"It bothers me, but I just keep walking,\\" she said. Goodman is skeptical that lawmakers can do anything about it, though. \\"You can't really control what comes out of people's mouths,\\" she said. Hollaback is pushing the city to commission a study, a public awareness campaign and perhaps even legislation, including \\"no-harassment zones\\" around schools to protect young women. \\"Too commonly, street harassment is believed to be the price women pay for living in New York City,\\" said its executive director, Emily May. \\"But we're not buying it.\\" Councilmembers said they are open to many of the ideas, but said they are in the early stages of exploring just what can be done. If there were to be legislation, a key issue would be enforcement, since the concept of no-harassment zones could encroach on First Amendment rights. New York men who told the AP they have called out strange women on the street said they were doing it just to be friendly and seemed genuinely surprised that any attention can be unwelcome. \\"We say hello, that's all, nothing derogatory,\\" said Tony Alibrandi, 54, a construction worker taking a lunch break with several of his fellow workers. \\"We see a friendly face, we say hello.\\" Terrence Beam, 41, said he had no problem with lawmakers investigating \\"whistling and howling and that sort of thing.\\" \\"Yeah, because that would be harassment,\\" he said. ||||| Happy Friday Hollas!

School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in which Charles Dickens novel?","output":"School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in the Charles Dickens novel \\"Hard Times\\" published in 1854. \\"Hard Times\\" is set in the fictitious industrial town called Coketown, located in the north of England during the time of the Industrial Revolution. The novel critiques many aspects of industrial life, including oppressive factory conditions, the exploitation of workers, and the dehumanizing effects of utilitarianism and the education system. Thomas Gradgrind is a central character in the story, representing the utilitarian educational philosophy prevalent during the 19th century. He is a man who values facts and statistics above all else in his pursuit of efficiency and pragmatism, and he is driven by a dogmatic belief in rationality. Dickens portrays Gradgrind as a harsh and unsympathetic character who suppresses imagination, creativity, and emotional growth in his students and children. Gradgrind runs a school where students are treated as machines tasked with absorbing and processing facts. In his school, the emphasis is on rationality and quantifiable metrics as opposed to developing well-rounded individuals capable of independent and moral thinking. His educational methods create unfeeling and unsympathetic individuals who struggle to deal with emotional challenges and relationships later in life. Throughout the novel, Gradgrind's perspective on education is challenged by various experiences and encounters with other characters that promote human compassion, love, and understanding. By the end of the novel, Gradgrind undergoes a personal transformation, recognizing that his extreme utilitarian views were flawed and that they negatively impacted his children's development. He comes to acknowledge the importance of imagination, empathy, and emotions in cultivating a healthier and more balanced society. In addition to presenting the dangers of a fact-based, utilitarian education, \\"Hard Times\\" explores themes such as class division, labor, and the impact of industrialization on society. Through his vivid depictions of Coketown and its inhabitants, Dickens provides a social commentary that invites readers to reflect on the human cost of the Industrial Revolution and the pursuit of a mechanical approach to life. In conclusion, School Master Thomas Gradgrind is a character in Charles Dickens' novel, \\"Hard Times,\\" published in 1854. The novel critiques the then-contemporary educational system and Industrial Revolution's consequences, with Gradgrind serving as a central figure who comes to understand the limitations and failings of his once unyielding utilitarian beliefs."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

In the study, which will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in March, men on beta-blockers were less likely to have brain changes suggestive of dementia. Experts say it is too early to recommend beta-blockers for dementia. The findings are preliminary and larger studies in men and women from different ethnicities are needed to see what benefit beta-blockers might offer. People with high blood pressure are advised to see their doctor and get their condition under control to prevent associated complications like heart disease, stroke and vascular dementia. Having high blood pressure may damage the small vessels that supply the brain with blood. Blood carries essential oxygen and nourishment to the brain and without it, brain cells can die. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and can occur if blood flow to the brain is reduced. Other research in a much larger sample of men - 800,000 in all - suggests another type of blood pressure drug known as an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may cut dementia risk, including Alzheimer's disease, by as much as 50%. The latest work in 774 Japanese-American men found that all types of blood pressure medication were better than no treatment in terms of signs of dementia in the brain - brain shrinkage and tiny areas of brain tissue damage caused by poor blood supply - noted at autopsy after death. However, men who had received beta-blockers as their only blood pressure medication had fewer abnormalities in their brains than those who had not been treated for their hypertension, or who had received other blood pressure medications, the University of Hawaii team found. Men on beta-blockers and other medications also had fewer brain abnormalities, but not as big a reduction as that seen in the men on beta-blockers alone. In the study, 610 of the men had high blood pressure or were being treated for high blood pressure. Study author Dr Lon White said: \\"With the number of people with Alzheimer's disease expected to grow significantly as our population ages, it is increasingly important to identify factors that could delay or prevent the disease. \\"These results are exciting, especially since beta-blockers are a common treatment for high blood pressure.\\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \\"Hypertension is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's and other causes of dementia, and keeping high blood pressure in check could be important for preventing these diseases. \\"This study suggests a link between the use of beta-blockers and fewer signs of dementia, but as the results of this study have yet to be published in full, it's not clear what caused this link.

Would \\"LSD is very potent, with 20–30 μg (micrograms) being the threshold dose.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is a powerful, psychoactive substance that has significant effects on the human body and brain. While the statement \\"LSD is very potent, with 20–30 μg (micrograms) being the threshold dose\\" is accurate, it doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of how LSD impacts the human body. Here, we will delve into a more detailed understanding of what happens when someone consumes LSD and its various short-term and long-term effects. LSD is considered a hallucinogen, which means that it primarily works by altering an individual's perception, thoughts, and feelings, leading to distorted sensory experiences. This often includes hallucinations, which can involve seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren't actually present. The primary effects of LSD are on the neurotransmitter systems in the brain, specifically targeting the serotonin receptors. Serotonin is a chemical that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, memory, perception, and other cognitive functions. By binding to these receptors, LSD alters their normal functioning and triggers the brain to create the vivid and often unpredictable experiences associated with an LSD trip. When an individual consumes LSD, the effects typically start within 30 minutes to an hour, peaking around 2 to 4 hours after ingestion and lasting for 8 to 12 hours in total. However, the duration and intensity of the experience may vary depending on numerous factors, such as the individual's body chemistry, the dosage, the method of consumption, and their psychological state. Short-term effects of LSD on the human body and mind can include: 1. Visual and auditory hallucinations 2. Distorted perception of time and space 3. Enhanced sensory experiences (increased sensitivity to colors, sounds, and tactile sensations) 4. Emotional changes, including euphoria, anxiety, and rapid mood swings 5. Disorganized thinking and difficulty concentrating 6. Enhanced creativity and introspection 7. Impaired judgment and decision making 8. Altered body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure 9. Dilated pupils 10. Dry mouth and loss of appetite 11. Sleep disturbances 12. Tremors and muscular weakness While most people experience these effects during an LSD trip, some individuals may undergo a \\"bad trip,\\" which entails intense feelings of fear, paranoia, panic, and confusion. These negative experiences can be detrimental to the individual's mental health, leading to long-lasting anxiety or trauma in some cases. Long-term effects of LSD are not as well understood, but they can occur for various reasons. Some individuals may develop a condition called Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD), which induces persistent, random hallucinations and visual disturbances even after the drug has left their system. Another potential long-term effect is flashback, wherein users re-experience specific LSD trip aspects without consuming the drug. Continued LSD use may also impact mental health, with some users developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, or prolonged psychosis. In conclusion, while the statement \\"LSD is very potent, with 20–30 μg (micrograms) being the threshold dose\\" correctly conveys the drug's strength, it doesn't provide a comprehensive understanding of how LSD impacts the human body. The primary effects of LSD are felt in the brain, where it binds to serotonin receptors and alters their functioning. This leads to a range of physiological and psychological effects, including hallucinations, enhanced sensory experiences, and altered perception of reality. While some long-term effects may occur—such as HPPD and mental health impacts—further research is required to understand their prevalence fully."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: A massive ancient subglacial trough deeper than the Grand Canyon has been discovered under Antarctica. Part of a massive ancient mountain range, it was found buried under several km of ice using specially developed penetrating radars. The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. All calm - the area above the giant mountain range, which is covered in upto 7km of ice. The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Researcher were able to chart it for the first time by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. In fact, it is so large researchers say it can be seen from space - despite being several kilometres underground. The research involved scientists from Newcastle University, the University of Bristol’s Glaciology Centre, the British Antarctic Survey and the universities of Edinburgh, Exeter, and York. They charted the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands – an ancient mountain range buried beneath several kilometres of Antarctic ice - by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. The researchers spent three seasons investigating and mapping the region in West Antarctica. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Professor Martin Siegert, Professor of Geosciences at the University of Bristol, said: 'While the idea of West Antarctic Ice Sheet growth and decay over the past few million years has been discussed for decades, the precise location where the ice sheet may originate from in growth phases, and decay back to in periods of decay, has not been known. Of of the sub-ice radar images which helped researchers pinpoint the vast valley, showing the giant mountains ans passes between them. 'By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic. 'The region uncovered is, therefore, the site of ice sheet genesis in West Antarctica.' The team’s analysis has provided an unprecedented insight into the extent, thickness and behaviour of this ancient icefield, and the configuration and behaviour of the early West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The subglacial landscape shows where and how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet originated and grew. It also provides important clues about the size and shape of the ice sheet in West Antarctica in a warmer global climate. The findings are published in the latest edition of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. Another image showing the vast valley, outlined in black here. The paper’s lead author Dr Neil Ross, from Newcastle University, said: 'The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterisation of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous. 'We had acquired ice penetrating radar data from both ends of this huge hidden valley, but we had no information to tell us what was in between. 'Satellite data was used to fill the gap, because despite being covered beneath several kilometres of ice, the valley is so vast that it can be seen from space. 'To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously-unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.'The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

And the answer is...","output":"To solve this problem, we'll follow the main steps of algebraic problem solving: Step 1: Understand the Problem The problem here is simplified to finding the value of the variable h. This is a simple linear equation, where -304h and 316h are terms with the variable h and -24 is a constant term. Step 2: Write the Equation The equation given to solve is -24 = -304h + 316h. Step 3: Combine Like Terms The first thing to do is to combine like terms on one side of the equation. So, the equation becomes -24 = 12h. This is done by combining (-304h + 316h) because both terms have the variable h. When you add -304h and 316h, you get 12h (as 316 minus 304 equals 12). Step 4: Solve for h We solve for h by isolating h on one side of the equation. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we have to follow the arithmetic operations in order. After combining like terms, we are left with a simple division, which is perfectly in line with the order of operations. So, to isolate h, we divide both sides of the equation by 12: -24 / 12 = 12h / 12 This simplifies to: -2 = h So the solution to -24 = -304h + 316h in terms of variable h is h = -2. This means when h is equal to -2, the equation holds true. If you substitute h = -2 back into the original equation, the equation will be valid: -24 = -304*(-2) + 316*(-2), which simplifies to -24 = -24. In conclusion, the solution (value for h) for the given equation -24 = -304h + 316h is h = -2."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two sets, and a question.

Both sentences discuss the creation of a plan of the room and the inclusion of furniture in the plan for convenience purposes. However, there are a few subtle differences between the two sentences: 1. Wording: In Sentence 1, the author uses the phrase \\"I append,\\" which means to add something as an attachment or supplement, while in Sentence 2, the author simply uses the term \\"I created.\\" Although these two phrases have different wordings, they both convey the same message that the speaker was the one who made the plan. 2. Definiteness: Sentence 1 uses the words \\"principal articles of furniture,\\" implying that perhaps only the main or most important furniture pieces have been included in the plan. Sentence 2, on the other hand, uses the phrase \\"some of the furniture,\\" which suggests that the speaker included a certain selection of furniture in the plan, but it may not necessarily be the principal articles. 3. Structure: Apart from minor linguistic differences, the general structure of both sentences remains the same. They both start by mentioning the motive for creating the plan (\\"for convenience\\") followed by the action of creating or appending the plan, and finally detailing what has been included in the plan. In conclusion, while there are some minor differences in wording and definiteness between the two sentences, the second sentence is essentially entailed by the first sentence as they both convey the same fundamental concept: a room’s plan has been created (or appended) including furniture pieces in it with the primary purpose of convenience."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The allegations surfaced last week, when the East Bay Express, a weekly newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area, published a story about graphic photographs that appeared on one section of the Web site. The photographs, which show the bodies of several people killed in shootings, explosions, or fires, include crude captions, some of which mock the dead. Pentagon and Army officials yesterday issued strong statements condemning the taking and posting of such photographs, but said there is little evidence to authenticate them and few ways to pursue a criminal investigation. While some of the photos appear to show U.S. soldiers in uniform near mutilated bodies, it is unclear where or when the pictures were taken. The Web site's creator said yesterday that about 30,000 members of the military are registered on his site, several thousand of whom have sent him photographs or comments from their official military Web addresses. Many of the photographs depict life in Iraq, while only a few are extremely graphic, he said. \\"It's an uncensored view of the war, from their perspective,\\" said Chris Wilson, 27, of Florida, who began accepting the photographs from soldiers overseas as payment for access to pornography on his Web site. \\"It's a place where the soldiers can express themselves without being filtered by the Bush administration,\\" he added. Those who submit photos of war casualties could be breaking military rules against \\"unbecoming\\" conduct and also could be in violation of government regulations regarding use of the Internet. Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have access to the Internet, largely at Internet cafes, and many have digital cameras. Paul Boyce, an Army spokesman, said investigators have been examining the photos for clues to their origin, adding that commanders in the field are emphasizing that taking and posting such photos is unacceptable. \\"If accurate, these are gruesome depictions of deceased people in Iraq, and that violates the standards of our values, training and procedures that we ask military personnel to observe and obey,\\" Boyce said. \\"It is very difficult to establish they are in fact being submitted by soldiers, where they were taken, who they were taken by, and the circumstances surrounding them.\\" The Council on American-Islamic Relations has decried the photographs and called for a Pentagon investigation. An official said the images could inflame insurgents and give other nations the mistaken impression that many Americans are gloating over casualties of the Iraq war. \\"What we're most concerned about is the safety of our own soldiers,\\" said Arsalan Iftikhar, CAIR's legal director. \\"It only tarnishes our image even further and serves as fodder for the insurgents and terrorists.\\" Wilson, who said he supports the soldiers and the war, said users must search out the corpse photos, which are not displayed prominently on the site.

No. While these two questions have some similarities, they don't convey the same meaning. The key difference lies in their underlying focus. The first question focuses purely on the military aspect: \\"How powerful would the combined military power of India and Pakistan be?\\" Here, the question is inquiring about the potential strength and capabilities of the collective military forces of both India and Pakistan. The core point of interest is the potential joint military operations, strength, strategies, and the overall military might they would achieve when unified. On the other hand, the second question is broader in scope: \\"How powerful would a combined India and Pakistan be?\\" This question not only encompasses the military aspect but also delves into the political, social, economic, and cultural implications of a merger between the two countries. It attempts to gauge the power dynamics and the potential advantages and disadvantages that may arise from the hypothetical union of these two nations. The question delves into various sectors such as the joint economy, the shared geopolitical stance, the potential internal and external challenges, and their overall influence on a global stage. In conclusion, though these questions have similarities, they address different points of concern. The first question strictly pertains to the military aspect, while the second question raises broader implications that include – but are not limited to – their military power."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Gay Austrian fashion reporter BrÃ¼no Gehard is fired from his own television show, Funkyzeit mit BrÃ¼no (Funkytime with BrÃ¼no) after disrupting a Milan Fashion week catwalk (whose audience included Paul McCartney), and his lover Diesel leaves him for another man.

The company will replace aspartame with a blend of sucralose and acesulfame potassium in Diet Pepsi, Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi sold in the U.S. beginning in August. The move follows a 5.2 percent decline in Diet Pepsi’s sales volume last year, according to Beverage-Digest. Sales of Coca-Cola’s Diet Coke, which also uses aspartame, dropped 6.6 percent. PepsiCo is getting the jump on Diet Coke, the country’s No. 1 sugar-free soda, in removing the controversial sweetener. Consumers have been backing away from both brands in recent years, fearful that the lab-created sweetener may cause cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said there’s no proof of a health risk from aspartame. “Decades of studies have shown that aspartame is safe, but the reality is that consumer demand in the U.S. has been evolving,” Seth Kaufman, senior vice president of Pepsi and the company’s flavors drinks in North America, said in an interview. “The U.S. diet cola consumer has been asking and asking and asking for an aspartame-free great diet cola.” Coke’s Response Even so, Coca-Cola isn’t budging. “There are currently no plans to change the sweetener for Diet Coke, America’s favorite no-calorie soft drink,” Scott Williamson, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. “All of the beverages we offer and ingredients we use are safe.” PepsiCo’s decision came after consumer complaints accelerated during the past two years -- with feedback flowing in through call lines, social media and letters, Kaufman said. In surveys, aspartame was the top reason given by consumers for drinking less of the diet cola, he said. “It’s been going on for some time, and the volume of it over the past two years has really been high,” Kaufman said. The rising worry over aspartame coincides with a surge in demand for natural ingredients, with more consumers rejecting artificial additives and highly processed foods. The trend has been stoked by social media, where nutrition advocates -- with or without formal training or scientific proof -- spread warnings faster and wider than ever. Food Babe Controversial blogger Vani Hari, who calls herself the Food Babe, says aspartame is “one the most dangerous substances allowed in our food supply. Aspartame is linked to diabetes, autoimmune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more -- once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.” PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, doesn’t have plans to replace aspartame in Diet Mountain Dew, despite a 3 percent sales decline. That product is the company’s best-selling diet beverage after Diet Pepsi. There are no plans to remove aspartame from other PepsiCo soft drinks either, Kaufman said. The focus for the change is on colas with declining sales. With aspartame-sweetened Pepsi Max, for example, consumers didn’t cite the ingredient as one of the top 10 reasons they were drinking less of it, Kaufman said. The FDA approved aspartame for use in some beverages and foods in 1981. Two years later, the ingredient was allowed in carbonated beverages. It was then ruled a “general-purpose sweetener” in 1996, giving it freer rein. Highly Studied “Aspartame is one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety,” the agency said. “FDA scientists have reviewed scientific data regarding the safety of aspartame in food and concluded that it is safe for the general population under certain conditions.” People with a rare hereditary disease that makes it hard for them to metabolize aspartame’s phenylalanine are advised to limit its ingestion, the FDA warns. The agency requires labeling to inform people who are at risk. Acesulfame potassium, meanwhile, was first approved for food in 1988 and is used in drinks such as Coke Zero, which also contains some aspartame. Sucralose, marketed as Splenda and used in a version of Diet Coke, was first approved in 1998. The FDA has deemed both sweeteners safe. Cancer Rats While Sucralose and acesulfame potassium haven’t generated the same level of fear among consumers, the sweeteners aren’t free from concern. The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends “caution” over sucralose because of an unpublished 2012 Italian study that said the sweetener caused leukemia in mice. The Washington-based group says to “avoid” acesulfame potassium because of rat studies suggesting that the ingredient caused cancer. Sucralose, a synthetic product of molecular engineering, may get a pass from some because it is at least derived from table sugar. Acesulfame potassium, also a synthetic chemical, hasn’t been used as widely and is lesser known to consumers. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, took a shot at the aspartame revolt in mid-2013 with print ads in national publications that defended its safety. Sales of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi both declined almost 7 percent that year. The crisis, which came on top of a consumer reaction against high-calorie sugar-sweetened drinks, has forced Coca-Cola and PepsiCo into the lab for solutions. Both have aggressively pursued a natural, noncaloric ingredient called stevia, which is extracted from a leaf and is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Stevia doesn’t work so well in colas, however. It gives off a metallic aftertaste when used in higher doses. So the soda makers are researching ways to ferment and bioengineer copies of a better-tasting stevia molecule found in the leaf. As for aspartame, Kaufman declined to say how PepsiCo’s decision would affect Coca-Cola, saying only that “we’re excited that we’re the first scaled business to do it.” ||||| PepsiCo Inc. said Friday it would remove the sweetener aspartame from Diet Pepsi, seeking to address consumer concerns about the artificial additive and reverse slumping diet soda sales. PepsiCo said it would switch to sucralose, a less controversial but still artificial sweetener. The beverage giant said the change—the boldest soda reformulation since Coca-Cola Co.’s New Coke fiasco—was in response to consumer surveys showing aspartame as the No. 1 reason Americans are shunning diet colas. ... ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"PepsiCo has announced it will start selling Diet Pepsi without aspartame later this year, after a 5.2% decline in the product's sales volume last year due to consumer backlash against the artificial sweetener.

As a result, colleagues in the office grew more suspicious and began questioning the integrity of their professional decisions. In the weeks leading up to the lane closures, there was a palpable sense of animosity between Kelly and Stepien. It was during this time that Kelly sent the notorious \\"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\\" email. While some speculated that it was a practical joke to get back at her former lover, others believed it to be a genuine attempt to use her power to create chaos and, in turn, damage Stepien's reputation. As investigations into the traffic scandal progressed, both Kelly and Stepien were put under immense pressure. With their relationship now a matter of public record, both their personal and professional lives were under scrutiny, and the already rocky relationship between the two completely broke down. Authorities intervened, conducting a thorough investigation into the entire scandal, including the role the former couple played in the decision-making process. They discovered that Kelly and Stepien's personal drama had indeed been a contributing factor to their decision-making process, resulting in questionable choices and abuse of power. Consequently, both Kelly and Stepien faced legal consequences for their actions. The public's trust in Christie's administration was shattered, and Christie himself faced backlash regarding his choice in staff and his handling of the situation. The scandal became a significant turning point in his career, and many speculated that it would prevent him from pursuing higher political office in the future. In the end, Kelly and Stepien's relationship served as a cautionary tale for mixing personal and professional relationships in the political world. While both eventually moved on to other opportunities, they were forever marked by their role in the scandal.

They met during high school and formed a bond that not many people could understand. As the years went by, their friendship took a turn for the worse due to a myriad of factors. Ultimately, these factors culminated in Shannon taking the drastic step of ending Drew's life. The following aspects of their relationship and personal circumstances may have contributed to the eventual and tragic outcome: 1. Jealousy: Shannon may have harbored feelings of envy towards Drew's successes or relationships with other people. When jealousy grew to an unbearable level, it could have clouded Shannon's judgment and prompted her to act violently. 2. Unresolved conflict: Over the years, the two friends might have had disagreements and conflicts that remained unresolved. These unresolved issues could have festered and developed into deep-seated resentment, contributing to Shannon's decision to kill Drew. 3. Mental health issues: Shannon may have suffered from untreated mental health conditions that could have led to erratic behavior, impulsive decision-making, or an inability to control her emotions. In a moment of turmoil, these factors could have influenced Shannon's actions. 4. External influences: The existence of a third party or external factors could have put pressure on Shannon to act in a way she would not have if the situation were different.

Everyone is getting unwell.\\" This may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD 53 wrote it. We all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel? Inventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives. One family in the UK went \\"back in time\\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones. The grandmother, Lyn, said, \\"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a \\"trendy , beer-drinking granny\\", to one who cooked things. The passage is mainly about _ .

This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque... answer the following question: What two locations in Sicily was the development of the new Baroque style evident?","output":"The passage does not explicitly mention two specific locations in Sicily where the development of the new Baroque style was evident. However, it does provide clues about where we can observe these architectural developments. The passage talks about the strong influence of Tommaso Napoli and Rosario Gagliardi in Sicily, as well as mentioning the city of Palermo in relation to church interiors. One can infer that Palermo is one of the locations in Sicily where the new Baroque style flourished, as the passage states, \\"church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours.\\" Moreover, even though the passage does not directly state another location, research indicates that the city of Noto is another significant example of Sicilian Baroque architecture. Rosario Gagliardi, one of the architects mentioned in the passage, designed several buildings in Noto, contributing to the development of the new Baroque style in the city. In summary, two locations in Sicily where the new Baroque style was evident are Palermo and Noto. These cities showcase the strong influence of Sicilian architects, their unique individual styles, and the adaptation of Baroque design according to local needs and traditions."},{"instruction":"Die Costa Blanca umfasst den Küstenstreifen der Provinz Alicante und weist eine typisch mediterrane Landschaft auf.

He did, however, give a number of lectures during the pre-Civil War years, beginning as early as November, 1837. A number of his friends and family members were more active abolitionists than he, at first, but from 1844 on, he took a more active role in opposing slavery. He gave a number of speeches and lectures, and notably welcomed John Brown to his home during Brown's visits to Concord. He voted for Abraham Lincoln in 1860, but Emerson was disappointed that Lincoln was more concerned about preserving the Union than eliminating slavery outright. Once the American Civil War broke out, Emerson made it clear that he believed in immediate emancipation of the slaves. Around this time, in 1860, Emerson published The Conduct of Life, his seventh collection of essays. In this book, Emerson \\"grappled with some of the thorniest issues of the moment,\\" and \\"his experience in the abolition ranks is a telling influence in his conclusions.\\" In these essays Emerson strongly embraced the idea of war as a means of national rebirth: \\"Civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution, [are] more rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity.\\" Emerson visited Washington, D.C, at the end of January 1862. He gave a public lecture at the Smithsonian on January 31, 1862, and declared:, \\"The South calls slavery an institution... I call it destitution... Emancipation is the demand of civilization\\". The next day, February 1, his friend Charles Sumner took him to meet Lincoln at the White House. Lincoln was familiar with Emerson's work, having previously seen him lecture. Emerson's misgivings about Lincoln began to soften after this meeting. In 1865, he spoke at a memorial service held for Lincoln in Concord: \\"Old as history is, and manifold as are its tragedies, I doubt if any death has caused so much pain as this has caused, or will have caused, on its announcement.\\" Emerson also met a number of high-ranking government officials, including Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury; Edward Bates, the attorney general; Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war; Gideon Welles, the secretary of the navy; and William Seward, the secretary of state. On May 6, 1862, Emerson's protege Henry David Thoreau died of tuberculosis at the age of 44. Emerson delivered his eulogy. He often referred to Thoreau as his best friend, despite a falling-out that began in 1849 after Thoreau published A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Another friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, died two years after Thoreau, in 1864.

The committee began an investigation last week into Dr. Jackson’s White House work record, and its Republican and Democratic leaders jointly announced Tuesday that his confirmation hearing, planned for Wednesday, would be postponed indefinitely “in light of new information presented to the committee.” “We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,” said Senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the committee chairman, and Jon Tester of Montana, its top Democrat, in a joint statement. “We will continue looking into these serious allegations.” Dr. Jackson, speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill before meeting with a Republican senator Tuesday afternoon, gave no indication that he would withdraw his nomination. He also did not answer questions about the accusations. But he added, “I’m looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering everybody’s questions.” Members of Mr. Tester’s staff said that they had been given several credible accounts of Dr. Jackson being intoxicated during official White House travel. In several cases, they said, he had apparently grabbed his medical bag and was “attempting to assert himself,” to show he was in charge. On one trip during Barack Obama’s presidency, White House staff needed to reach Dr. Jackson for medical reasons and found him passed out in his hotel room after a night of drinking, Tester aides said. The staff members took the medical supplies they were looking for without waking Dr. Jackson. ||||| Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson‘s confirmation hearing, initially set for Wednesday, has been postponed pending an investigation into allegations against him. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo The White House mounts full defense of Ronny Jackson, Trump’s VA nominee The move comes as new allegations, including workplace misdeeds and over-prescribing medication, threaten to sink the nomination. The White House on Tuesday mounted an all-out defense of President Donald Trump’s embattled pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs as serious allegations of misbehavior threatened to tank the nomination. Trump met with Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician and VA secretary nominee, in the Oval Office on Tuesday evening. A White House official described it as a “positive meeting,” adding that the president pledged to stand behind Jackson and push back on the allegations against him. Jackson, in turn, said he had no current plans to withdraw his nomination. Story Continued Below Jackson, whom Trump announced as his VA nominee via Twitter last month, is facing allegations of creating a hostile workplace environment, over-prescribing medication and drinking while on duty. The allegations, which are circulating among members of Congress, could further complicate an already difficult Senate confirmation. Lawmakers in both parties had already raised concerns about Jackson’s lack of experience, worrying that he doesn’t have the chops to run the government’s second-largest bureaucracy. But by Tuesday night, the White House was circulating talking points aimed at countering the allegations, saving Jackson’s nomination and heading off another embarrassing defeat of one of the president’s Cabinet picks. “Dr. Jackson’s record as a White House physician is impeccable,” a senior administration official said in a statement. “He has improved unit morale, received glowing reviews and promotions under Republican and Democrat presidents, and has been given a clean vet from the FBI.” The allegations against Jackson have reignited lingering paranoia in the West Wing that administration officials are working against the president’s priorities. It’s no secret that many White House officials harbored doubts about Jackson’s nomination, and several top West Wing aides believe that his critics in the administration are trying to kill the nomination or pressure Trump to choose a different nominee. But Trump, who has for years complained that he is being unfairly treated by the news media and his political opponents, is sympathetic to the doctor’s situation, according to another White House official.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared to send mixed signals about Jackson, telling reporters during a news conference that he would “always” support Jackson, but openly musing about why he’d want the job in the face of intense media scrutiny. “He’s a fine man. I’ll always stand behind him,” Trump said about the White House physician, adding that it was Jackson’s choice to remain the nominee or withdraw. “What does he need it for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren’t thinking nicely about our country? I really don’t think, personally, he should do it, but it’s totally his … decision.” During the Tuesday news conference, Trump wasn’t sending a message to Jackson that he should step down, the White House official said. The president was instead publicly reflecting his frustration at seeing somebody he likes face such intense and personal criticism. But others in the White House believe it is foolhardy to continue backing a nominee who was facing a rocky confirmation even before the rumors began circulating, given his lack of experience leading such a large organization. One administration official privately expressed annoyance that Trump’s penchant for nominating his friends and allies with little vetting had led to another confirmation mess. Among the documents provided by the White House in its bid to push back on the allegations were evaluations from Trump and President Barack Obama, including handwritten notes from both from 2014 to 2017. “Ronny does a great job — genuine enthusiasm, poised under pressure, incredible work ethic and follow through,” Obama scrawled on a 2016 report. “Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family and my team. Continue to promote ahead of peers.” Obama recommended “early promote” in each of the three evaluations provided by the White House. The White House also distributed two inspector general reports from 2012 and 2013, when Jackson was director of the White House Medical Unit and Jeffrey Kuhlman was physician to the president. The reports painted a strained relationship between the two that created problems throughout the unit, but seemed to place most of the blame on Kuhlman. Jackson replaced Kuhlman as physician to the president in July 2013. Meanwhile, lawmakers announced that they would delay Jackson’s confirmation hearing — which was scheduled for Wednesday — in order to get more information about the allegations. The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee is demanding 12 years of documents about Jackson’s service as the presidential physician and in the White House medical unit. The allegations were in full public view by Tuesday afternoon after Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the committee, gave an interview with NPR outlining the allegations. Tester said allegations included “improper dispensing of prescription drugs, repeatedly drunk while on duty while traveling and creating a toxic work environment.” White House officials first became aware of the rumors about Jackson when Capitol Hill aides passed along what they were hearing, one of the White House officials said. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201804/625/1155968404_5775820956001_5775751502001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Privately, Republicans are fretting that a flood of bad press could prove unsustainable and derail the nomination to lead the sprawling agency. “I can’t tell” if it’s in trouble, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. “I don’t know if the allegations are credible. If they are, it’s a serious matter.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was noncommittal on Tuesday morning when asked whether he had confidence in Jackson. “We are going to wait and see what the administration and Chairman Isakson recommend, McConnell said, referring to Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). Members of Trump’s legislative affairs team huddled on Tuesday morning to discuss the nomination as reports of allegations proliferated. After the meeting, a White House official said there were no current plans to withdraw the nomination, and the press shop separately issued a public statement in support of Jackson. “Admiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country,” deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement on Tuesday. “He’s served as the physician to three presidents — Republican and Democrat — and been praised by them all. Admiral Jackson’s record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what’s needed at the VA to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.” Meanwhile, Jackson was making his case for his nomination on Tuesday despite the firestorm, meeting with Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, in his Capitol Hill office as a horde of journalists waited outside. “He does deny that he’s done anything wrong in his service to the country and particularly his time at the White House,” Moran said after meeting with Jackson. “He knows of nothing that would prohibit him from being qualified.” A failed nomination would be an embarrassing debacle for the White House, and the postponed hearing is reminiscent of Andy Puzder’s failed nomination to be labor secretary last year. Republicans are operating under a razor-thin majority of 51 senators, several of whom have already expressed concern with Jackson’s lack of experience to operate the massive VA. Isakson and Tester wrote Trump a letter on Tuesday asking for “all documentation pertaining to Rear Admiral Jackson’s service in the White House medical unit and as Physician to the President.” In the meantime, senators are being cautious about the claims of misconduct. “Swirl of allegations happens all the time,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “You have to show proof. Haven’t seen that yet.” Trump named the White House physician to lead the sprawling bureaucracy after firing David Shulkin, even after Isakson personally implored Trump to keep Shulkin. The move raised eyebrows in Congress and among veterans groups because Jackson has never led a large organization. Veterans groups said the delay and additional vetting for Jackson were appropriate. “This is an important Cabinet position,” said Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. “If the Senate needs more time to properly vet this nominee, they should take that time. I just hope that the confirmation process for the VA secretary doesn’t distract from passing legislation to fix the VA’s Choice and community care programs.” Democrats took an aggressive posture toward the allegations against Jackson, demanding more information and saying the scandal reflected poorly on Trump’s White House. “It needs to be addressed. Right now. Today,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told POLITICO. “The White House needs to be forthcoming. It has been clearly careless and negligent in vetting.” The nomination will be “unacceptable” unless the White House offers further information, Blumenthal added. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Tuesday morning: “Maybe one day the president, who we know acts on impulse, had this nominee in the room ... and said: ‘Hey, let’s put you up without any vetting.’” As the White House physician, Jackson had already been subjected to a basic background check and review of his past. But multiple people familiar with the process said he did not undergo a thorough vetting ahead of his nomination to lead the VA. The concern on Capitol Hill is palpable. Isakson spoke with fellow committee members over the weekend to discuss the “unsubstantiated allegations,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told NPR on Tuesday. “We have been given a brief sketch of what they are, but I’d prefer not to discuss them at this time. As I say, they are unsubstantiated,” Rounds said. “The chairman is aware of them. He’s discussed them with the White House. … These are serious allegations and they’re ones that we most certainly want to get through and vet properly.” Elana Schor, Lorraine Woellert and Louis Nelson contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) Senate Veterans Affairs Committee members are assessing allegations from whistleblowers that have told the panel about nominee Ronny Jackson's questionable behavior including excessive drinking and a \\"toxic\\" work environment under his leadership, according to two former White House medical staff members who have spoken with the committee. Both sources who spoke with CNN told the committee about behavior they observed while working in the White House medical unit. Lawmakers who spoke with CNN expressed worries that this could represent a pattern of behavior and not a collection of isolated incidents. In addition, committee staff have been in contact with individuals associated with additional allegations regarding the handling of prescriptions by the White House Medical Unit and a workplace survey that was done because of issues in the unit under Jackson, according to congressional sources. The accounts come from former and at least one current associate of Jackson, according to the sources. The accusations have roiled the nomination process leading to the postponement of a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. Wednesday's hearing. However the committee has not substantiated the claims, with little documentation available to back the claims. Jackson told reporters on Tuesday that he \\"can answer the questions absolutely.\\" \\"I'm looking forward to rescheduling the hearing and answering everyone's questions,\\" Jackson said Tuesday afternoon on Capitol Hill as he left a meeting with committee member Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican. Trump defended Jackson at a news conference Tuesday as \\"one of the finest people I have ever met,\\" and said it is \\"totally his decision\\" on whether Jackson wants to withdraw. Details from 2012 A 2012 Navy Medical Inspector General review of White House medical operations recommended the Navy \\"consider\\" replacing either Jackson or another military physician of equal rank, or both according to an administration official who is directly knowledgeable about the report. The six-page report was ordered as a review of White House medical operations when staffers reported low morale because of bickering between the two men who were both Navy captains at the time. The official emphasized the report only recommended the change in personnel be \\"considered,\\" but didn't make it a mandatory order. It likely would have been up to the Obama White House to make a change if it wanted to, the official said. The two men did not apparently get along because they were of equal rank and struggled for control of the operation. The official said it became clear that \\"line of authority\\" needed to be established. The report ended with a strong critique of the other doctor saying the medical staff believed he was \\"irrevocably damaged his ability to effectively lead and serve.\\" The report did not ultimately effect his promotion. A senior administration official downplayed the accusation of a toxic work environment surrounding Jackson, saying a workplace survey was done in 2012 after the doctor was promoted and some people in his office complained about the work environment. That report didn't address alcohol or patient care, according to the official, who saw the document but declined to release it publicly. The White House Medical Unit oversees the medical care for the President, his family and administration aides. It includes a team of doctors and nurses and operates from a suite of offices in the basement of the White House residence. The Veterans Affairs Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, told CNN that the FBI background investigation into Jackson is \\"clean\\" -- and that there are no issues of concern in his background check. They are still inquiring about the complaints that have been made to the committee to see if they can be corroborated. The White House is only allowing the committee chair and ranking member to review the FBI background check, per a source familiar with the matter. Hearing postponed Lawmakers leading the confirmation announced on Tuesday morning that the hearings will be delayed indefinitely following allegations related to improper conduct in various stages of Jackson's career. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson and Tester of Montana, made the announcement on Capitol Hill. The two committee leaders said they want more information about the allegations of misconduct involving Jackson. They declined to discuss the nature of the allegations -- and both men stopped short of calling on him to withdraw. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota and member of the VA committee, told reporters that over the weekend, Isakson held a call with GOP members on the VA committee to brief them on what he was learning about Jackson. Rounds said that it was clear from the call that Isakson and Tester had been communicating with each other about what they were learning. CNN reported Monday that lawmakers from both parties on the committee are raising concerns about allegations involving Jackson and are reviewing them to determine if they are substantial enough to upend his nomination. Committee members have been told about allegations related to improper conduct in various stages of his career, two sources said. Combine that series of allegations that one GOP senator told CNN would be \\"devastating\\" if true, with overall ambivalence that bordered on opposition by Republicans and things are not in a good place for Jackson. Two sources with knowledge told CNN that Isakson called the White House at one point in the past few days to outline the depth of the concern raised about Jackson in the allegations. Those sources told CNN that while there was no explicit demand to pull the nomination, it was their understanding that message was intended. Isakson's office denied the senator ever directly suggested or intended to convey to the White House that they consider pulling the nomination. Isakson called White House Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday night to inform him Jackson's hearing would be postponed. GOP aides that spoke with CNN Monday night were characterizing this nomination going down as a \\"when,\\" not \\"if,\\" situation. Democrats huddled privately over these allegations Monday night. The bigger issue: the allegations are a trigger, not the sole reason, for Republicans to bail on this nomination. For weeks committee Republicans have been grumbling about the White House dropping Jackson, who they viewed as unsuited for the job, on their respective laps. Several GOP aides described their bosses as willing to hold off from criticism until the hearing in deference to the President's selection. Now they're confronted with these allegations and Jackson doesn't have many allies on the Hill willing to protect him. Monday's news left lawmakers and their staff scrambling, as both sides are trying to figure out what's true. As one senior Republican aide put it: \\"A mess. A complete, utter mess.\\" But at least one Republican did not yet see this as the end of the line for Jackson's nomination. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma told reporters, \\"I think he's damaged right now but he's resurrectable.\\" This story has been updated to include additional developments and information. ||||| Navy Rear Adm.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 16, 2018, file photo, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson speaks to reporters during the daily press briefing in the Brady press briefing room at the White House, in Washington. Now it’s Washington’s turn to examine Jackson. The doctor to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday his choice to lead Veterans Affairs would soon make a decision on whether to withdraw after the emergence of late-surfacing allegations about inappropriate behavior on the job and overprescribing prescription drugs. \\"It's totally his decision,\\" Trump said. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would \\"stand behind\\" Dr. Ronny Jackson to become his VA secretary, calling him \\"one of the finest people that I have met.\\" But he questioned why Jackson would want to put up with the scrutiny, which he characterized as unfair. \\"I told Adm. Jackson just a little while ago, I said, 'What do you need this for?' This is a vicious group of people that malign and they do and I lived through it,\\" Trump said. \\"I said, 'What do you need it for?' He's an admiral, he's a great leader. And they question him about every little thing.\\" Trump said he didn't want to put Jackson through \\"a process like this — it's too ugly and too disgusting. So we'll see what happens. He'll make a decision.\\" Trump added, \\"I wouldn't do it. What does he need it for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren't thinking nicely about our country?\\" Jackson's hearing had been set for Wednesday at the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee but was indefinitely postponed amid the allegations. \\"We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,\\" said the chairman, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. \\"We will continue looking into these serious allegations and have requested additional information from the White House to enable the committee to conduct a full review.\\" The two lawmakers sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday requesting additional information about Jackson, who has served as a White House physician since 2006. It demands any communication between the Pentagon and the White House for the last 12 years regarding \\"allegations or incidents\\" involving him. With Congress set to recess Friday for a week, Tester said the soonest a hearing could be held would be in about 10 days. \\"We're vetting hard right now,\\" he told reporters. \\"We still have more information to find out.\\" Allegations began surfacing late last week involving Jackson's workplace practices, including claims of inappropriate behavior and over-prescribing prescription drugs, according to two aides granted anonymity to discuss the situation. Isakson told fellow GOP senators over the weekend about the allegations prompting those on the panel to give their support for delaying the hearing, one senator said. \\"Chairman Isakson had a phone conversation with a lot of us around the committee over the weekend, indicated that there had been some unsubstantiated allegations made, and he wants to do it right,\\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. on Fox News @ Night With Shannon Bream. \\"We told him that if he wanted to delay the meeting, that was fine with us. We most certainly want to get all the facts out,\\" he said. Democrats on the committee assembled privately late Monday. Tester reiterated to the other senators that the allegations were out there, one aide said. But no specific evidence of wrongdoing was offered. White House and VA officials were quietly discussing a delay with key allies outside the administration, even as the White House on Tuesday scrambled to save Jackson's troubled nomination. \\"Admiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country. He's served as the physician to three Presidents_Republican and Democrat_and been praised by them all,\\" said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley. \\"Admiral Jackson's record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what's needed at the VA to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.\\" Trump selected Jackson to head the VA last month after firing former Obama administration official David Shulkin following an ethics scandal and mounting rebellion within the agency. But Jackson, who has worked as a White House physician since 2006, has faced numerous questions from Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as veterans groups about whether he has the experience to manage the massive department of 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans. A doomed nomination would be a political blow to the White House, which has faced criticism for sloppy vetting of Cabinet nominees and tough confirmation battles in a Senate where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority. Prior to Jackson's nomination, Trump had told aides and outside advisers that he was fond of Jackson personally and was said to be particularly impressed with Jackson's performance at the podium in January when he offered a glowing report on the president's physical and mental well-being. \\"The White House does not vet their nominees. That leaves us as members having to look at their personal and leadership and other qualities, and they didn't do a good job and now we're doing it,\\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Senate committee. She did not comment on the specific allegations against Jackson. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is not on the veterans panel, also criticized the White House vetting process, saying that the allegations against him arose after Trump nominated him. \\"I don't know whether this is an aberration or not, but it certainly is something that bears looking into.\\" She said recent allegations of ethical violations in Oklahoma by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt also raise questions about White House vetting. Late Monday, Jackson was still pursuing support, and held a late-afternoon conference call with veterans groups from West Virginia and the state's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a member of the committee, whose vote could be vital for support. Rounds said Jackson's small staff at the White House will be an issue as he prepares to lead the VA. \\"We've got 360,000 people there,\\" he said. \\"Are they going to manage the secretary or is the secretary going to manage the VA? That's a good question to ask, and he needs to answer it. He needs to be the leader. A lot of folks want to be led and managed.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas, Alan Fram and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Concerns over the nomination of Dr. Ronnie Jackson for the role of secretary of Veterans Affairs have grown, following recent accusations of misconduct. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee postponed Dr. Jackson's confirmation hearing, indefinitely, after interviewing more than 20 people who had allegedly worked with him. The group comprised both current and former military individuals. Accusations claim Dr. Jackson had been intoxicated during his service on official White House travel, and in some cases asserted his authority through his role. Dr. Jackson has not indicated a desire to withdraw his nomination, stating that he was looking forward to getting the hearing rescheduled and \\"answering everybody’s questions.\\" The allegations against Dr. Jackson have added further complications to an already difficult Senate confirmation. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns over Jackson's lack of experience, expressing apprehension over his ability to lead the government’s second-biggest bureaucracy. The White House has continued to stand behind Trump's VA nominee despite the allegations, as President Donald Trump met with Dr. Jackson in a \\"positive meeting\\" according to White House officials. The meeting was then followed by circulation of talking points aimed at countering the allegations. These allegations have aggravated paranoia that some administration officials are working against President's agenda. Despite many White House officials sharing concerns regarding Jackson's nomination, they believe that critics in the administration are trying to prevent Jackson's appointment. Additionally, the allegations have once again ignited the debate over President Trump nominating his friends with a lack of proper vetting, which has led to continued confusion over confirmations.

One question focuses on the elliptical nature, while the other emphasizes its near-circular shape. Step 2: Determine if the questions are asking the same thing Upon analyzing both questions, the focus of each question seems to be different. Question 1 asks why the orbit of the Earth around the sun is an ellipse, while question 2 asks why the orbit is nearly circular. Step 3: OPT Based on the analysis, the answer to whether these two questions are asking the same thing is: [1]. no Now, I'll answer both individual questions separately: 1. According to string theory, why is the Earth rotating around the sun on an ellipse, while the gravitation field of the sun should be almost perfect circle? Although string theory is a framework that attempts to describe the fundamental structure of the universe, it isn't directly relevant to the shape of Earth's orbit. Rather, classical physics and the laws of gravitation, as formulated by Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler, better explain the elliptical orbits. The reason Earth's orbit is an ellipse rather than a perfect circle is due to the combination of its tangential velocity, the attractive force of the sun's gravity, and the conservation of angular momentum. When Earth moves closer to the sun, its velocity increases and moves it slightly away from the sun. When it moves farther away, its velocity decreases, causing it to fall back into the sun's gravitational pull. This interaction between the gravitational force and the Earth's velocity results in an elliptical orbit rather than a perfect circle. 2. Why is Earth's orbit around the sun almost circular? While Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, it is indeed close to being circular. This is due to the balance between the gravitational force between the Earth and the sun, as well as the Earth's angular momentum that keeps it in motion. The Earth's orbit has a low eccentricity (around 0.0167), which means it is only slightly elliptical. The near-circular orbit of the Earth can be attributed to the stable balance of forces acting on it and the initial conditions under which the solar system formed. Over time, the gravitational interaction among objects in the solar system, as well as their velocities, resulted in the near-circular orbits we observe today."},{"instruction":"Q:Roland felt his stomach knotting.

His father, William Johnston Burr (1889-1985), was a hardware salesman; his mother, Minerva Annette (nee Smith, 1892-1974), was a pianist and music teacher who was born in Chicago, Illinois. Burr's ancestry included Lebanese, Irish, English, Scottish, and German. When Burr was six, his parents divorced. Context: In 1985, Burr was approached by producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman to star in a made-for-TV movie, Perry Mason Returns. The same week, Burr recalled, he was asked to reprise the role he played in Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), in a low-budget film that would be titled Godzilla 1985. \\"When they asked me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and everybody thought I was out of my mind,\\" Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. \\"But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them.\\" He agreed to do the Mason movie if Barbara Hale returned to reprise her role as Della Street. Hale agreed, and when Perry Mason Returns aired in December 1985, her character became the defendant. The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale's real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake, Jr. The movie was so successful that Burr made a total of 26 Perry Mason television films before his death. Many were filmed in and around Denver, Colorado. By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Perry Mason movie, The Case of the Killer Kiss, he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds. Twelve more Mason movies were scheduled before Burr's death, including one scheduled to film the month he died. As he had with the Perry Mason TV movies, Burr decided to do an Ironside reunion movie. The Return of Ironside aired in May 1993, reuniting the entire original cast of the 1967-75 series. Like many of the Mason movies, it was set and filmed in Denver. Question: What was wrong with his health? Answer:","output":"Raymond Burr experienced declining health throughout the latter part of his life, primarily due to kidney disease and cancer. By the time he was working on the Perry Mason television films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his health issues had significantly worsened, and he was using a wheelchair full-time. It is believed that he was also suffering from other health complications, possibly related to his weight and lifestyle choices, which further impacted his mobility and overall wellbeing. In addition to kidney disease, Burr was diagnosed with cancer in 1992. His battle with cancer continued alongside his work on the Perry Mason and Ironside television films until his death on September 12, 1993. Raymond Burr's determination to continue working while facing serious health challenges demonstrated his strong commitment to his craft and his fans."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? Mary always makes a better salad than Victoria because Choose your answer from: I. Mary never forgets to wash the lettuce.; II. Victoria never forgets to wash the lettuce.;","output":"The sentence ends with the option \\"I. Mary never forgets to wash the lettuce.\\" So, the complete sentence is: \\"Mary always makes a better salad than Victoria because Mary never forgets to wash the lettuce.\\" In this sentence, the comparison between the salads made by Mary and Victoria is being drawn, and the point being made is that Mary's salad preparation is better. The reason provided for Mary's superior salad-making is her attention to detail specifically, in the action of washing the lettuce. Cleaning and washing vegetables, including lettuce, is crucial in salad preparation as it helps remove dirt, bacteria, and potential pesticide residues that could potentially pose health risks to the consumers. By including this detail, the sentence emphasizes the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in the food preparation process. It suggests that because Mary always remembers to wash the lettuce, her salads are of higher quality than Victoria's. Additionally, based on the context provided, we can infer that Victoria might not always make it a priority to wash the lettuce, which could affect her salad's quality as well. Consequently, people might prefer Mary's salads over Victoria's, owing to the better preparation practices. To summarize, the sentence highlights Mary's commitment to maintaining cleanliness when making her salad, which results in a better dining experience for those who consume her food. By emphasizing such attention to detail, it underscores that a simple act like washing the lettuce can make a significant difference in the quality of the final product. In this case, Mary's diligence and dedication to hygiene translate to a better salad than Victoria's."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following passage \\"Richard Hurd believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose: an ironist \\"should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ridicule shine through the Imitation.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) MIAMI — Michael Cohen, who for years has served as President Trump’s personal attorney, has hired a lawyer of his own to help him navigate the expanding Russia investigation. Cohen confirmed Friday to The Washington Post that he has retained Stephen M. Ryan, a Washington-based lawyer from the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery who has experience prosecuting criminal cases as an assistant U.S. attorney. Cohen’s hiring of Ryan as his personal lawyer was first reported by Katy Tur of NBC News. Cohen’s decision is the latest indication that the Russia probe overseen by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is intensifying and could end up focusing on a number of Trump associates, both inside and outside the White House. [Trump lashes out at Russia probe; Pence hires a lawyer] Michael Caputo, a New York-based political operative and radio commentator who served as a senior communications adviser on Trump's campaign, also has hired a lawyer of his own to navigate the Russia probe. Caputo has retained Dennis C. Vacco, a former New York state attorney general and a partner at the law firm Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman. His hiring also was first reported by NBC's Tur. On Thursday, Vice President Pence’s office announced that the vice president had hired outside legal counsel, Richard Cullen, to assist him with inquiries from the Mueller investigation as well as congressional committee probes. During a Friday morning event here in Miami, The Post asked Pence whether he had any comment about hiring his own lawyer. The vice president said only: “It’s very routine. Very routine.” It is not entirely clear what role Cohen or Caputo might have in the Russia investigation. Cohen, who worked as a lawyer for the Trump Organization for a decade, made an appearance in the dossier compiled by a former British spy. The dossier, which was published online in January by BuzzFeed, alleged that he had traveled to Prague to meet with Russians and coordinate their hacking efforts. Trump has rejected the dossier as “fake news,” and Cohen has vigorously denied its allegations about him, noting he was in California at the time it alleged he had visited Prague. Congressional investigators asked President Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to turn over documents related to potential contacts with Russia and testify in front of Congress — but on May 30, Cohen said he'd refused to do so. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) In January, Cohen was involved in a separate incident that could potentially have drawn the attention of investigators. He has confirmed that he met with a Ukrainian lawmaker at a New York hotel at the urging of a former Trump business associate named Felix Sater. At the meeting, Sater gave Cohen a peace plan that the lawmaker had drawn up for his country that would have paved the way for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Russia after its 2014 military incursion in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that Cohen said he took the plan and left it in the White House office of then national security adviser Michael Flynn, days before Flynn resigned over his contacts with Russia's ambassador. Cohen told the Post that he had merely recommended Flynn as the proper recipient for the plan but that he had taken the written proposal home and thrown it away. [Amid Russia scrutiny, Trump associates received informal Ukraine peace proposal] Caputo, who briefly worked for the campaign, was an ally to former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. He lived in Moscow for several years in the 1990s, and briefly held a contract in 2000 with the Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media to improve Russian President Vladimir Putin's image in the United States. |||||Summary:","output":"Michael Cohen, a long-time attorney and adviser of US President Donald Trump, has hired Stephen Ryan, a partner at the McDermott, Will and Emery law firm, to represent him in investigations exploring Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process of electricity generation in a wind turbine, and it would lead to a halt in electricity production. Here's a breakdown of the process with the mentioned perturbation: 1. Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades. 2. The shaft of the turbine spins as a result of the movement of the blades. 3. Perturbation occurs: The shaft disconnects from the blades. This means that the spinning motion of the blades will no longer be transferred to the shaft. Due to the disconnection of the shaft from the blades, the following steps in the process will be affected: 4. Since the shaft is no longer spinning, it will not transfer the rotating motion to the generator. 5. As a result, the generator's rotor will not spin inside the core, which has magnets surrounded by wire loops. 6. Since the rotor is not spinning inside the core, no magnetic field is being induced, which means there will not be any generation of electricity. So, in summary, the perturbation of disconnecting the shaft from the blades has a direct and significant effect on the process. This is because the mechanical energy from the wind is no longer being converted into electricity due to the disruption in the energy transfer process. Such a perturbation in the system would result in an inability to generate electricity, as the mechanical motion driven by the wind is no longer being transferred downstream to the components responsible for electrical generation."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

Using oral or rub-on anesthetics before to provide pain relief before you receive a numbing shot. Having the option of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) available. Creating a spa-like environment, with relaxing music, aromatherapy, and a calm space. Providing noise-canceling headphones so that you do not have to hear the noise of the drill. Knowing relaxation and hypnosis techniques to help guide your breathing to keep you calm. Telling the patient what will happen so that the patient feels in control and safe. If you have a crippling anxiety of the dentist, you might want to look into the possibility of having your cavity filled while you are sedated. There are some extra risks from this option, and not every dentist uses sedative dentistry. However, there are many who will use sedatives to calm down a fearful patient. Be sure that you arrange for a friend or a taxi driver to take you home after the procedure. It is not safe to drive after waking up from sedation. While it might be tempting for you to use calming substances such as anti-anxiety medication or alcohol, you do not want to ingest anything that might interact poorly with dental anesthetics. Always talk to your dentist first about appropriate steps you can take to minimize your anxiety during a filling. Some people have dental fears because of bad experiences long ago. However, dentistry is much more sophisticated now. Anesthetics are more effective, drills are quieter, and there is a lot of new technology that can help a patient remain more comfortable. Try to keep an open mind about the dentist, and talk to your dentist about the tools that he or she uses. Keeping yourself distracted is a great way to ensure that you remain calm during your filling. There are a variety of techniques that you can use and discuss with your dentist. For example, you could: Prepare a soundtrack of your favorite relaxing music that you could listen to during the procedure. Memorize a poem or a mantra that you can recite mentally to keep yourself distracted. Use deep breathing techniques to minimize anxiety. It might be hard to do these with your mouth open, but some relaxing breathing techniques are still possible, such as breathing in through your nose for five seconds, holding for five seconds, and releasing for five seconds. Ask if you could have your filling done in a room with a television or screen with distracting or relaxing images. Having a friend or family member present can help keep you calm if you have trouble in the dentist's chair. Ask your dentist if she is comfortable with you having a loved one in the room with you to keep you grounded and to make sure that you are all right during the filling procedure. Summary:","output":"Many people feel scared or anxious about going to the dentist. There are many things that can cause this fear, like not liking how your teeth look, being afraid of needles, or not liking the sound of the dental drill. To help with your fear, try to figure out where it comes from and talk to your dentist about it. They might be able to use new tools or techniques to make you feel more comfortable. For example, they might use water-based tools, give you pain medicine before the numbing shot, or play relaxing music during the appointment. If you're very worried, you could also think about getting your dental work done while you're asleep with a special medicine called a sedative. But, always remember to talk to your dentist about your feelings and ask for help if you need it."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: forest, rise, valley, view","output":"Step 1: Identify the concepts to include in the sentence: forest, rise, valley, view.

Michael Chong has been working on the private member's bill for years, and has become a standard-bearer for rebalancing the power between the Prime Minister's Office and Parliament. His proposed legislation would also give party riding associations the ultimate say in electoral nominations, removing the leader's signature from the equation for the first time since 1970. But the measures that focus on MPs are the most likely to stir debate in the House of Commons, particularly at a time when the power of the executive is in the spotlight. Details of how Prime Minister Stephen Harper's staff allegedly tried to manipulate a Senate committee report and an independent audit were laid out in an RCMP affidavit filed last week in court. Conservative sources familiar with Chong's bill say it's not a direct reaction to what's currently in the news, and wouldn't even come into effect until after the next election. Chong had been forced to introduce the bill or risk losing his place in the order of Commons consideration. When asked about the bill Friday, Chong said, \\"I'm going to wait until the bill is introduced in the House before providing public comment.\\" One measure would entrench in the Parliament of Canada Act that the different Commons caucuses — also referred to as parliamentary parties — have the power to trigger a leadership review vote, as long as 15 per cent of the caucus applies in writing for one. After that, a simple majority of MPs, 50 per cent plus one, could vote to turf the leader and have a leadership race. Members of Australia's Labour party caucus recently used that power to eject leader Julia Gillard, and Conservative MPs in Britain have the same power. In the case of Chong's bill, the power would be restricted to the House of Commons caucus, and not the larger national caucus that includes senators. Theoretically, the MPs would be cautious about how they vote because of their new, closer relationship to the riding associations that helped send them to Ottawa. The idea would also be to make political engagement more attractive to Canadians, with the knowledge they have more power at the grassroots level. Commons caucuses would also have the right to elect their own chairs and to call for a review of an MP, as well as to eject or readmit them. Right now, it is the prerogative of the leader alone — as Harper showed this year when MP Dean Del Mastro was shown the door after being charged under the Canada Elections Act. Chong's bill is expected to be introduced next Thursday, and would potentially see second reading debate in February or March. There is a quiet but substantial section of the Conservative caucus that has bridled against Harper's control, which has extended to their questions and votes in committees, and what they say on the floor of the Commons. This spring, they rallied behind MP Mark Warawa's bid to give MPs the right to make statements of their own choosing in the Commons. MP Brent Rathgeber left the Conservative caucus in June, complaining about the gradual transfer of power from members of Parliament to the Prime Minister's Office and cabinet. Chong is a popular figure in the Conservative caucus, regarded as a moderate and measured straight-shooter with a lot of integrity. He himself resigned from a cabinet post in 2006, saying he did not agree with a government motion recognizing Quebec as a nation. In order for Chong's private member's bill to fly, he will need more than just the support of his own colleagues — MPs from other parties will also need to come on board.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Gestapo, abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei, or the Secret State Police, was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank) is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

Options: - party - it is bordered by the atlantic ocean to the east - dinner - friend's house - internet cafe","output":"To determine where a conversation is likely to get loud, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Party: A party usually involves a gathering of people who are celebrating or socializing. This typically involves music, dancing, and high-energy interactions which can lead to loud conversations. 2. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east: This option appears to be a geographical reference and not a location where a conversation would take place. This option can be ruled out. 3. Dinner: A dinner setting typically involves eating and socializing in a more intimate and relaxed environment. Although conversations might be lively, they are usually not as loud as in other social gatherings. The chances of loud conversation are comparatively lower here. 4. Friend's house: Depending on the purpose of the visit, a friend's house can range from a quiet, intimate setting to a louder, more social gathering. The volume of conversations at a friend's house will depend on the context and nature of the gathering. 5. Internet cafe: An internet cafe is a place where people primarily use computers for various tasks, such as browsing the web, playing games, or working. Conversations in an internet cafe might happen between people or online, but it is not primarily a social gathering location with a loud atmosphere. Based on this analysis, the most likely place for a conversation to get loud is at a party. The high-energy environment, music, and large gatherings of people typically lead to louder conversations."},{"instruction":"Q:Taylor pressed Skylar's hands on the table to make an impression in the clay for Taylor's latest art project.

Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days. Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions? Answer:","output":"In comparing the two villages, we can infer that Hill village experiences more dangerous cycling conditions in comparison to Low village. There are several factors we need to consider while determining the safety of cycling conditions in both villages. These factors include terrain, weather conditions, and other environmental elements that may impact a cyclist's experience. 1. Terrain: Hill village is located on a mountain, which naturally indicates that it consists of hilly terrain. Cycling on hilly terrain can be difficult and more dangerous due to the requirement of greater physical effort, the higher likelihood of accidents occurring while descending steep slopes, and the need to maintain balance on uneven surfaces. On the other hand, Low village is situated in a valley, which generally has flatter terrain, making it easier and safer to cycle as it does not involve much uphill or downhill riding. 2. Weather conditions: Hill village gets lots of rain, increasing the risk of slippery surfaces and reduced visibility during rainfall. Wet roads and paths make it harder for a cyclist to maintain traction, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Additionally, heavy rainfall can lead to the formation of puddles and waterlogging, which can create unexpected obstacles for cyclists, further endangering their safety. Conversely, Low village has more sunny days, resulting in drier roads and better visibility, which translates to safer cycling conditions. 3. Other environmental factors: While both villages have lots of people riding bicycles, we can infer that visibility and communication among cyclists may be more challenging in Hill village due to its mountainous terrain and frequent rainfall. Cyclists may have difficulty in seeing and avoiding other riders on twisting and turning mountain paths. In comparison, Low village's valley location and sunnier climate may provide better overall visibility and ease of communication among those cycling. 4. Infrastructure: Although we do not have explicit information about the cycling infrastructure in both villages, we can presume that the challenging terrain and weather conditions in Hill village might make it more difficult to design and maintain proper cycling facilities, including safe and well-draining roads, cycling lanes, and appropriate signage. On the other hand, Low village's flatter terrain and fair weather may allow for better-maintained infrastructure for cycling. In conclusion, based on the factors discussed above, it is reasonable to presume that cycling conditions in Hill village are more dangerous than in Low village. The combination of challenging terrain, inclement weather, and potential limitations of infrastructure contribute to a higher risk for cyclists in Hill village."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: I should like to refer to the general report which occupied us in two sittings last year.","output":"Haluaisin viitata yleiseen raporttiin, joka kiinnitti huomiomme kahdessa istunnossa viime vuonna.

It is an iconic and groundbreaking title in the history of video gaming, often credited for redefining the point-and-click adventure game genre. \\"Myst\\" was developed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller, released by their company Cyan, Inc. under the publishing of Brøderbund in September of 1993. The game was originally designed for the Apple Macintosh system, but its success led to adaptations into numerous platforms and operating systems over the years including Microsoft Windows, Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, among others. In \\"Myst,\\" the player takes on the persona of \\"The Stranger.\\" The game begins with The Stranger finding a book titled \\"Myst,\\" from which the game gets its name. Upon reading this book, The Stranger is transported to Myst Island, a mysterious and desolate place ripe for exploration. From Myst Island, players must explore different \\"Ages,\\" each representing a different world with unique environments, puzzles, and mysteries. One of the most compelling aspects of \\"Myst\\" gameplay involves travelling between these Ages, using linking books, which are essentially portals to these different worlds. These Ages are largely the creations of Atrus, a key character in the game's rich and immersive narrative, and reveal a distinct narrative and aesthetic fully realized by the game’s designers. Noteworthy among the Ages featured in the game are the Mechanical Age with its fortress hovering in the sky, the Stoneship Age with its three rocky islands surrounded by oceans, and the Channelwood Age, a water-based environment with treehouses connected by elevated walkways, among others. \\"Myst’s\\" gameplay is non-linear, meaning that players have the freedom to explore these different Ages in any order, piecing together the story at their own pace. It's the player's ingenuity and power of deduction that guide \\"The Stranger\\" through the Ages, solving a series of complex puzzles and uncovering the island's dark secrets. The game is known for its iconic visuals which were highly advanced for the time of its release, and its sound design, creating an immersive and atmospheric gaming experience. The intricacy and depth of the plot, the immersive quality of the setting and the uniqueness of the gameplay mechanics rendered \\"Myst\\" a landmark in video gaming and a quintessential example of the possibilities of virtual world-building in the medium. This, coupled with the game’s rich narrative, resulted in something of a cultural phenomenon, with \\"Myst\\" handing the title of best-selling computer game for almost a decade. \\"Myst\\" spanned several sequels including \\"Riven\\", \\"Myst III: Exile\\", \\"Myst IV: Revelation\\" and \\"Myst V: End of Ages\\", each continuing the narrative and preserving the design ethos of the original. Along with the sequels, the game’s legacy has been preserved through remakes and re-releases, ensuring its status as a classic of the interactive medium."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Task: Write a sentence not in English. 1.

The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal. Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious purposes. Whom they marry may be influenced by socially determined rules of incest, prescriptive marriage rules, parental choice and individual desire. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, child marriage, polygamy, and sometimes forced marriage, may be practiced as a cultural tradition. Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns for women's rights and because of international law. In developed parts of the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith or interracial, and same-sex couples. These trends coincide with the broader human rights movement. - Kerala, historically known as Keralam, is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar coast.

Write a to-do list before bed. 2. Go to sleep. 3. Sleep better than all the non-list-writing people you meet tomorrow. It sounds simple, but there's evidence that it just might work. According to a small study published in the January issue of Journal of Experimental Psychology, participants who took 5 minutes to write out a to-do list before bed fell asleep more quickly than participants who wrote about tasks they had already completed. The key, according to researchers, is in mentally \\"offloading\\" responsibilities before bedtime, theoretically freeing the mind for sound sleeping. [How to Sleep Better] \\"We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,\\" lead author Michael Scullin, director of Baylor's Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, said in a statement. \\"Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.\\" To test this hypothesis, researchers invited 57 men and women between ages 18 and 30 to spend one weeknight in a controlled sleep lab. The rules were simple: lights out at 10:30 p.m., and no technology, homework or other distractions allowed. Five minutes before bedtime, each participant was instructed to complete a short writing exercise. Half of the participants wrote about anything they needed to remember to do in the upcoming days, while the other half wrote about tasks they had completed during the previous days. When the exercise was done, participants tucked in for bed. Researchers measured each participant's brain activity overnight using a technique called polysomnography, which records eye movement, muscle activity and other biological changes. The researchers found that the participants who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who wrote about already-accomplished tasks. In fact, \\"the more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\\" the study authors wrote. \\"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\\" While 9 minutes may not seem like a lot of extra shut-eye, it's comparable to the improvement seen in clinical trials for some sleep medications, Scullin told Time magazine. A 2006 study similarly found that napping for just 10 minutes sufficiently improved participants' cognitive function and energy. The authors acknowledged that the new study could be improved by a larger sample size and more data taking each participant's personality and propensity for anxiety into account. Still, the paper's findings are consistent with other published research on the therapeutic power of keeping a journal. Previous studies have observed that expressive writing — writing about emotions and stress for 20 minutes a day — was linked to boosted immune function in patients with illnesses such as asthma, arthritis and HIV/AIDS. Other studies have drawn a line between journaling in times of stress or emotional hardship and stress relief. So, give writing before bed a try — and hope it's boring enough to put you to sleep. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Are you a fan of to-do lists? You may be at an advantage, because they could improve your sleep, according to a new report. Researchers from Baylor University recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, to determine if bedtime writing can be linked with better sleep. “We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,” lead author Michael K. Scullin said in a statement. “Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.” To do so, they examined 57 university students, who were split into two groups. While one group was asked to write down everything they needed to remember to do the next day or over the next few days, the other was required to write about completed tasks from previous days. Then all participants were instructed to go to bed right after those five-minute writing sessions. After analyzing the results, they found that those who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who jotted down things they already finished. \\"The more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\\" the study authors wrote. \\"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\\" The scientists noted their study was small and could be improved with more subjects. However, they believe their findings are strong. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A small study by sleep researchers at Baylor University, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, suggests that writing a to-do list before bed may help people fall asleep faster. The study involved 57 participants who spent one weeknight in a controlled sleep lab, with half being instructed to complete a short writing exercise about tasks they needed to perform and the other half writing about tasks they had already completed. Participants who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of nine minutes faster than those who wrote about already-accomplished tasks, indicating that mentally offloading responsibilities before bedtime may help achieve sounder sleep."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? \\" field.

It is a ceremonial county and a historic county, covered by three unitary authorities: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - Bedford is the county town of Bedfordshire, England. It had a population of 107,590 in 2011 together with Kempston but the urban area has a population of about 122,943. - Luton is a large town, borough and unitary authority area of Bedfordshire, England. Luton and its near neighbours, Dunstable and Houghton Regis, form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area with a population of about 258,000. It is located east of Aylesbury, west of Stevenage, north-northwest of London, and southeast of Milton Keynes. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Shuttleworth College is a further education college in the village of Old Warden in Bedfordshire , England . The college is part of Bedford College , and mainly offers courses and training related to agriculture and the natural environment . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - Biggleswade is a market town and civil parish located on the River Ivel in Bedfordshire, England. It has grown in population by nearly 10% over the past decade, primarily due to good transport links, being situated along the A1 road between London and the North, as well as having a railway station on the main rail link North from London (the East Coast Main Line). New housing developments mean that expansion is predicted to continue into the foreseeable future. - Central Bedfordshire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, England. It was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. With a budget of £500m the unitary council provides over a hundred services to a quarter of a million people, and is responsible for schools, social services, rubbish collection, roads, planning, leisure centres, libraries, care homes and more. - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, and electrical properties and forces. On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances. - A foundation degree is a combined academic and vocational qualification in higher education, equivalent to two thirds of an honours bachelor's degree, introduced by the government of the United Kingdom in September 2001. Foundation degrees are available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, offered by universities, by colleges that have their own foundation degree awarding powers, and by colleges and employers running courses validated by universities. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - College (Latin: \\"collegium\\") is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, or an institution offering vocational education. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some part of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. - The East of England is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It was created in 1994 and was adopted for statistics from 1999. It includes the ceremonial counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Essex has the highest population in the region. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Old Warden is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England, just west of the town of Biggleswade. It has a population of 275, increasing to 328 at the 2011 Census. The village grew up under the protection of the Cistercian Wardon or Warden Abbey nearby. - Edexcel, now known as Pearson - London Examinations, is a multinational education and examination body owned by Pearson. Pearson Edexcel, the only privately owned examination board in the UK, and part of Pearson PLC, is a portmanteau term combining the words Education & Excellence. It regulates school examinations under the British Curriculum and offers qualifications for schools on the international and regional scale. Edexcel is the UKs largest awarding organisation offering academic and vocational qualifications in schools, colleges and work places in the UK and abroad. It is also recognised internationally. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A secondary school, often referred to as a high school or a senior high school, is a school which provides secondary education, between the ages of 11 and 19 depending on location, after primary school and before higher education. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - An apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading). Apprenticeship also enables practitioners to gain a license to practice in a regulated profession. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies. Apprenticeships typically last 3 to 6 years. People who successfully complete an apprenticeship reach the \\"journeyman\\" or professional certification level of competence. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.

Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - North Carolina is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - An autobiographical novel is a form of novel using autofiction techniques, or the merging of autobiographical and fictive elements. The literary technique is distinguished from an autobiography or memoir by the stipulation of being fiction. Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction, the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the \\"autobiographical pact\\". Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author's life. While the events of the author's life are recounted, there is no pretense of exact truth. Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes. - Tanasi (also spelled Tanase, Tenasi, Tenassee, Tunissee, Tennessee, and other such variations) was an historic Overhill Cherokee village site in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The village was the namesake for the state of Tennessee. Abandoned by the Cherokee in the 19th century, since 1979 the town site has been submerged by the Tellico Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River. Tanasi served as the de facto capital of the Cherokee from as early as 1721 until 1730, when the capital shifted to Great Tellico. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.

If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room. Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational. If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict. If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead. You should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own. If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great. If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are. Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships. People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are. If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners. Be polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country. Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings. Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read. Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public. Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke. Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all. If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately. Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement.","output":"The text emphasizes the importance of being refined and maintaining a dignified, polite, and respectful demeanor in social situations. Refined individuals tend to keep their negative opinions to themselves and avoid gossiping about others. They strive to be positive, even when discussing people who are not present. This includes being polite when disagreeing with someone and avoiding confrontational behavior. Refined people do not boast about their knowledge and accomplishments. Instead, they wait for appropriate moments in conversation to casually share their interests and expertise. They also make a habit of praising others for their achievements. Spending time with like-minded individuals is essential for refined people. They surround themselves with friends who can contribute to stimulating conversations and encourage personal growth. However, they also avoid dominating conversations and try to inquire about others, ensuring a balanced exchange of ideas. Good manners are a sign of refinement, and refined people always act considerately towards others. They make sure people around them feel comfortable by being polite, respectful, and attentive to their needs. They also have the sensitivity to be conscious of cultural differences and take the time to learn about ways of life in other parts of the world. Reading, attending cultural events, and staying informed about various topics is essential for a refined individual to be well-rounded and knowledgeable. They also possess tact in communication, being careful with their words and timing to avoid causing offense or embarrassing others.

The sand collected could not be filled into just two buckets because the","output":"amount needed was much greater than anticipated. Sarah and Jack had underestimated the amount of sand they would need to complete their project: constructing a large sandcastle as a surprise for their younger sister, Lily, who was celebrating her birthday the following day. Step 1: Assess the situation The first thing Sarah and Jack needed to do was determine how much more sand they might need for their project. They carefully analyzed the sandcastle's blueprint and determined that they would require at least six more buckets of sand to make their creation into a reality. Step 2: Gather more buckets Knowing they needed more containers to carry sand, the duo searched their house and the nearby beach for additional buckets or any other suitable alternatives. They scoured the area and managed to find four more buckets and an old laundry basket. Though not the perfect option, the laundry basket would help them collect much more sand at once. Step 3: Notify the family With their younger sister's birthday looming, Jack and Sarah decided to inform their parents about the surprise, ensuring that Lily wouldn't accidentally stumble upon their project site. Their parents were thrilled about the idea and promised to keep the secret from their youngest daughter. Step 4: Collect more sand Upon returning to the beach, Sarah and Jack began filling their newly-acquired buckets and the laundry basket with sand. Ensuring the sand was damp enough, they carried the additional sand back to the construction site. As they worked, their parents even stepped in to help, aiding in collecting more sand and speeding up the process. Step 5: Construct the sandcastle Once they had enough sand, Sarah and Jack followed the blueprint closely and began working on the sandcastle. They crafted walls, towers, and a grand entrance, along with intricate details inspired by actual medieval castles they had seen in history books. Step 6: Final touches As the day drew to a close, they put the finishing touches on their creation. They added seashells, driftwood, and seaweed to help decorate and stabilize the sandcastle. Finally, just as the sun began to set, they stood back and admired their hard work, taking satisfaction in knowing it was something their sister would love. The following day, Lily awoke to a series of clues cleverly staged by her siblings, leading her to where the sandcastle stood. When she arrived and saw the beautiful creation that Jack, Sarah, and their parents had built for her, she was overwhelmed with happiness. They had not only built Lily an incredible sandcastle, but they had also crafted a memory that would last a lifetime for the entire family."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.duckduckgo.mobile.android.

Plot title: In Harm's Way Movie plot: The story opens on the night of December 6, 1941, at a dance in the Officers' Club at Pearl Harbor. We are at first introduced to Lieutenant (j.g.) William 'Mac' McConnel (Tom Tryon) and his wife Beverly (Paula Prentiss), who can't help but notice a visibly inebriated Liz Eddington (Barbara Bouchet) dancing with an Army Air Corps major (Hugh O'Brian) - spiting her husband who is at sea on gunnery practice. When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment. Her lover escorts her from the premises and takes her to spend the rest of the night on a beach near the base.Morning breaks over the unnamed heavy cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell 'Rock' Torrey (John Wayne), who is nonplussed to find that his executive officer, Liz's husband Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), has overslept reveille, the latest of a number of blemishes on his record that (along with his mounting alcoholism) can be laid to his unhappy marriage. He tells Eddington to 'fish or cut bait' and gives him one last chance to pull himself together. Eddington apologizes for his conduct, but is left wondering what Liz has gotten herself into in recent hours.In Pearl Harbor, Mac reports for duty as Officer of the Day on his destroyer, the U.S.S. Cassiday. With some consternation, he reads a radio dispatch from the destroyer U.S.S. Ward, which has depth-charged an unidentified submarine contact much too close to Pearl for comfort. Torrey's ship has received the same message; he orders alert status, then general quarters when one of his lookouts sights several large formations of planes flying over Oahu. The Japanese surprise attack is only minutes away. One formation flies over and strafes the beach where Liz Eddington and her lover are awakening, and they make a hasty escape back towards Pearl.

By doing this he makes the water colder and as water cools its density increases eventually freezing and becoming a solid, Ice. After a while mark forgets that he put the bottle of water in the freezer. He eventually remembers and comes back to check and the bottle of water is frozen solid. Because of this he leaves the bottle out on his kitchen counter for a few hours and returns to a nice cold bottle of water. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will lowering the temperature of water cause it's density to increase or decrease? Hint: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. The answer to this question is:","output":"Lowering the temperature of water will cause its density to increase, up to a temperature of about 4°C. After this point, if the temperature continues to drop and the water begins to freeze, the density will then start to decrease. This is because water has a unique property where it expands upon freezing, contrary to most other liquids."},{"instruction":"Question to you: What has radial symmetry?

Let's reason step-by-step:","output":"(A) Peachleaf Willow: Peachleaf willows are tree species, specifically Salix amygdaloides. These trees DO NOT have radial symmetry, as they have a somewhat symmetrical, irregular, and spreading shape. Their shape is bilateral, typical of most plants. (B) Sea Urchins: Sea urchins ARE organisms with radial symmetry. They belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which all exhibit a fivefold radial symmetry known as pentaradial symmetry. Their body structure radiates outward from a central point and includes species like starfish, sea lilies, and sand dollars. (C) Humans: Humans DO NOT have radial symmetry; instead, they have bilateral symmetry. Humans (and most animals) are shaped so that if a line is drawn down the middle, the left and right halves are mirror images of each other. (D) Gastropod shells: Gastropod shells DO NOT have radial symmetry. They often exhibit a unique spiral shape that grows as the gastropod (such as snails) grows. The spiral is a form of logarithmic symmetry, not radial symmetry. (E) A Greek letter: Greek letters are written symbols used as part of the Greek alphabet. These letters DO NOT possess radial symmetry, but instead, they can have various symmetries or none at all, depending on the letter. (F) Asymmetry: Asymmetry, by definition, is the lack of symmetry, so it DOES NOT have radial symmetry. Asymmetrical organisms or shapes have no axis of symmetry and no defined symmetry pattern. (G) Dogs: Dogs are animals, specifically mammals, and they DO NOT have radial symmetry. Like humans, dogs have bilateral symmetry with mirror-image halves when a line is drawn down the middle. (H) Most plants: The majority of plants DO NOT have radial symmetry. Most exhibit bilateral symmetry or asymmetry.

Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In the cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure. When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done. The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler. The first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712. It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \\"head\\".

To break down why this is the chosen answer, let's look at each option one by one: 1. \\"buffalo\\" - This is the name of an animal, not an action or behavior a sharp-toothed animal might do for dinner. 2. \\"fight for life\\" - Although animals might indeed fight for their lives during hunting or other actions, this phrase doesn't directly describe what an animal does for dinner. 3. \\"leave home\\" - Animals may leave their home in search of food, but the act of leaving home itself does not explain what they do for dinner. 4. \\"hunt for food\\" - A sharp-toothed animal, say a carnivore like a lion or a tiger, would indeed hunt for food for dinner. Their sharp teeth are effective tools for capturing and killing their prey, which is why this option makes sense. 5. \\"eating\\" - This could be a plausible answer. However, it's too general. Any animal, regardless of whether it has sharp teeth or not, eats for dinner. So, this doesn't provide a specific behavior of a sharp-toothed animal.

Movie title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he is watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South... The answer is:","output":"They discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration and their plans for an assassination of President Kennedy.

During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in), making them far larger than any living insect. This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In addition to Carboniferous, what other insect order is inclusive of extant groups, stem groups and Paleozoic groups?","output":"The question seems to ask for an additional insect order from a different time period that includes extant groups, stem groups, and Paleozoic groups. However, it is important to note that the term \\"Carboniferous\\" refers to a geologic period and not an insect order. During the Carboniferous and Permian periods, several insect orders emerged, including both extant groups, their stem groups, and a number of Paleozoic groups that are now extinct. Hence, it would be more appropriate to provide examples of insect orders that include extant groups, stem groups, and Paleozoic groups from these periods. One such insect order is the Palaeodictyoptera, which emerged during the Late Carboniferous period. This order includes several extinct Paleozoic subgroups, as well as connections to extant groups and their stem relatives within the broader group of insects. Although none of the Palaeodictyoptera species are extant today, their evolutionary significance makes them an interesting example of an insect order that includes different categories of groups as mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two sentences.

One day, Chloe's younger sister, Sophie, requests she and her new boyfriend, Stan, stay with Chloe and Tom for a couple of weeks while their apartment is being renovated. Chloe eagerly agrees, seeing this as an opportunity to bring some warmth back into her home and strengthen her bond with Sophie, whom she has drifted apart from over the years. Act II: Chloe quickly warms up to the easygoing and charming Stan, and the four of them spend quality time together. Stan, a part-time graphic designer, also seems to be interested in holistic healing, often recommending herbal supplements and remedies to Chloe and others in their group. One night, after a particularly bad argument between Chloe and Tom, Stan suggests Chloe try a specific natural sleep aid to help her relax. Chloe accepts his suggestion and takes the concoction that Stan has given her but does not immediately go to sleep.

He has successfully conquered some of the world's highest and most challenging peaks, leaving most speechless with his daring exploits. Anker is portrayed as a lone wolf, a man who prefers relying on no one but himself. - Cara Strickland, a talented journalist, is approached by a daring outdoor sports magazine to explore and document Anker Jensen's captivating life story. A deal is struck, and Cara sets out to secure an interview with the elusive and enigmatic Anker, in hopes of witnessing his incredible feats firsthand. - Cara catches up with Anker at the base of a particularly arduous mountain range, and, after an initially hostile encounter, she convinces him to let her accompany him and his climbing partner, Max, on their next expedition. With a professional documentary crew in tow, they make their way to a legendary mountain called \\"The Unchained Ascent,\\" a peak that has never been successfully scaled through free climbing. Act 2: - As the group journeys towards the base of The Unchained Ascent, Cara slowly uncovers Anker's troubled past. Born in a small mountain village in Scandinavia, Anker's passion for climbing began at an early age. However, tragedy struck when his best friend and former climbing partner, Lukas, died during an attempt to climb the infamous \\"Bitter Peak\\". Anker was left with a heavy heart and blame on his shoulders from the climbing community. Struggling with guilt and anger, he chose to move forward by conquering even more challenging heights. - Anker, Cara, Max, and the documentary crew arrive at the base of The Unchained Ascent, only to find that a team of rival climbers, led by the cunning and deceitful Sebastian, are also planning to scale the mountain. Anker faces a test not only of his climbing skills but also his ability to trust, as he must rely on Cara, Max, and the crew to outmaneuver and outclimb the rival team. - As they ascend the mountain, Anker and Max face extreme weather conditions, technical challenges, and hair-raising near-death experiences.

Translate this to English?","output":"We need this, as the issue is not only about the rights of the companies, but also about the rights of patients to get relief from genetic diseases. The importance of addressing the rights of both companies and patients cannot be overstated when it comes to genetic research and its applications. In this context, the statement asserts that it is essential to take into consideration not only the rights of companies involved in genetic research and related industries but also the patients who stand to benefit from the advancements in treating genetic diseases. For companies, the rights in question generally pertain to intellectual property, patents, and the ability to profit from their discoveries and innovations. These rights are crucial for the growth and sustainability of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors and, by extension, the continued development of new treatments, therapies, and diagnostic methods for genetic diseases. It is important that these companies are appropriately rewarded for their efforts and investments in research and development so that they are motivated to continue their work in this crucial field. On the other hand, patients suffering from genetic diseases also have rights that need to be taken into account. These rights include access to adequate healthcare, the right to be informed about available treatments and their potential risks and benefits, and the right to participate in decisions concerning their care. Furthermore, as genetic research progresses and potential cures or therapies become available, patients should have the right to access these treatments without facing insurmountable barriers such as prohibitively high costs or lack of availability due to exclusivity arrangements between companies and healthcare providers. In the broader context of public health and social justice, it is essential to strike a balance between the rights of companies and patients. This means finding a way to protect the interests of both parties, ensuring that companies are incentivized to pursue genetic research and develop new treatments while also making sure that patients can access these treatments in a timely and affordable manner. This balance may be achieved through a combination of government regulations, industry self-regulation, and collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors. Addressing the rights of both companies and patients in the realm of genetic diseases is a complex and challenging issue. However, finding a way to respect and protect the interests of both parties is crucial for the continued progress of genetic research and the development of novel therapies that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people suffering from genetic diseases."},{"instruction":"Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense?

They are concerned that the new policy will make it easier to track the activities of users across Google's many products -- from Gmail to YouTube. Marc Rotenberg heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. He says Google's aim is to create a single unified profile of its users. \\"We believe that not only is that a threat to privacy, we actually believe it is illegal, because last year Google entered into an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission in which they said they would not engage in that kind of data sharing without the permission of their users.\\" Google says its new policy will make it simpler for users to share information across services like Google Search, Gmail and Google Calendar. And it says the new policy will help personalize each user's experience. Over time, it says, users can expect to see better search results, fewer unwanted advertisements and more content targeted to their interests.

The room was lovely but was missing some of the standard amenities that were supposed to be there ( bottles of water, shampoo, paper towels for the kitchen etc) We had 4 rooms reserved and found that each of us got different service ... some got water, some got magazines, and the newspaper.. but we didn't all get everything. One of my TVs had no sound, I couldn't turn off the light in the kitchen, the temperature in the room was inconsistent, as someone else mentioned the water pressure in the shower was awful, and the black toilets... were just weird, plus even though I reported it twice the bulb remained out over the toilet in the bathroom my whole stay. Unfortunately the rooms are not sound proofed well, I could hear the traffic all night (sirens etc) even though I was on the 28th floor, and my neighbors alarm clock each morning. The complete black out curtains were great. I even had a projection TV that was as large as the whole wall. The hotel charges a daily resort fee but I couldn't figure out what it was for, the pool wasn't open, there were no bars, or lounges, and no other resort features.

Step 2: To find the total number of bones Lassie had before receiving the extra 10 bones on Sunday, we need to subtract these 10 bones from her current total (35 bones). 35 bones (total) - 10 bones (received on Sunday) = 25 bones Now she has 25 bones left after eating half of her bones on Saturday. Step 3: Since Lassie ate half of her bones on Saturday, the remaining bones (25) are also half of her original bones before eating. To find the original number of bones Lassie had before eating them on Saturday, we need to double the current number of bones (which is half after consuming them). 25 bones (half) * 2 = 50 bones So, Lassie started with 50 bones before eating them on Saturday."},{"instruction":"Question: Where could a wheel be produced?

Movie title: Dredd Movie plot: The future United States is an irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson intervenes and uses her psychic abilities to read Kay's mind and learn that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo...

Hypothesis: Amy Timberlake is a man","output":"Based on the provided context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Amy Timberlake is a man. In fact, there are a multitude of reasons to believe that the author may be a woman, although the context does not explicitly confirm either gender. Let's analyze the evidence and suggestions that might guide us to make an assumption about Amy Timberlake's gender. 1. Name: Amy is commonly a female name. It is derived from the Old French name Amée, which means \\"beloved.\\" Although names are not definitive indicators of gender, especially in the modern world, the name Amy would generally be associated with a woman. 2. Genre of writing: The context tells us that Amy Timberlake writes children's books. While this does not strongly indicate the gender of the author, it is important to note that women are well-represented in the field of children's literature, as both authors and readers. 3. Awards' names: Among the awards mentioned, the Friends of American Writer’s Literacy award could raise some curiosity regarding the gender of the author. Though the name of the award does not imply any gender restrictions, it may possibly make people ponder if it was awarded by a women's literary organization. The Edgar Awards, Parent’s Choice Gold Medal, Newbery Honor, and the 2004 Golden Kite Award have no references to gender, so they do not contribute to any assumption about Amy Timberlake’s gender. In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit evidence concerning the gender of Amy Timberlake, the clues, such as the first name \\"Amy\\", and the genre of her writing, lean toward the assumption that Amy Timberlake is a woman. However, it is crucial to remember that these assumptions are not definitive proof of the author's gender, and it is best to conduct further research or seek confirmation from reliable sources to accurately determine Amy Timberlake's gender."},{"instruction":"Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates.

They are 150 meters apart. How long will it take for the first car to catch up with the other car? Answer: It will take 7.5 seconds for the first car to catch up with the second car. In the given problem, we have two cars with different speeds: Car A: 70 km/h (faster car) Car B: 50 km/h (slower car) Since Car A is trying to catch up with Car B, we need to determine the relative speed between the two cars, which is the difference between their speeds: Relative Speed = Speed of Car A - Speed of Car B Relative Speed = 70 km/h - 50 km/h = 20 km/h Now, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to meters per second (mps) to match the given distance (150 meters): Let's recall that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Therefore, 20 km/h * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 20 * (1000/3600) mps 20 * (5/18) mps = 100/3 mps Now we have the relative speed in mps: Relative Speed = 100/3 mps The initial distance between the cars is given as 150 meters. To find the time 't' it takes for Car A to catch up with Car B, we can use the formula: Time (t) = Distance / Relative Speed t = 150 meters / (100/3 mps) t = 150 * (3/100) seconds t = 15/2 seconds Therefore, it will take 7.5 seconds for the first car (Car A) to catch up with the second car (Car B)."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: In our daily lives, we experience a constant cycle of activity and rest, which is maintained by an internal biological clock known as the circadian rhythm. As night approaches or after an extended period of mental and physical activity, the body experiences a gradual decrease in alertness and energy levels. The sleep-wake cycle consists of recurring periods of sleep and wakefulness, which are regulated by the wake-promoting regions in the brain, such as the hypothalamus, and the balance between sleep-inducing and arousal-promoting substances in the brain, like adenosine and orexin. Fatigue, stress, and natural processes in the body contribute to the desire to sleep, and relaxation techniques can further promote the onset of sleep. Around this time, the body demonstrates lowered body temperature, slowed heart rate and respiration, and increased production of sleep hormones such as melatonin. Upon reaching a threshold of relaxation and drowsiness, the individual enters a state of light sleep, followed by deeper sleep stages and potentially REM sleep, wherein dreaming can occur. Ultimately, our bodies and minds need this regular restorative process to function optimally, making falling asleep a crucial part of the sleep-wake cycle and our overall well-being."},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Afterimage.

A:","output":"The World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder is a widely-adopted framework designed to guide healthcare professionals in providing effective pain management for patients suffering from mild to moderate or severe pain, particularly in the context of cancer pain. The ladder consists of three major steps, with each step designed to treat increasing levels of pain intensity. Here is a detailed description of the WHO pain ladder and its three steps: Step 1: Mild pain At this stage, the pain is relatively mild or manageable, with a pain intensity rating of around 1-3 on a pain scale of 0-10. Patients at this step are typically advised to take over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as non-opioid analgesics. Some common medications include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Examples include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. These work to address inflammation and ease minor aches and pains. - Acetaminophen (paracetamol): This is a widely-used non-opioid analgesic that can be taken alone or in combination with other pain relief medications to manage mild pain. It's essential to follow dosing guidelines and consult with a healthcare professional if the patient's pain persists or worsens. Step 2: Mild to moderate pain When pain progresses to a moderate level (pain intensity rating of approximately 4-6), healthcare professionals may prescribe weak opioids to help manage the pain. At this step, patients are typically prescribed: - Codeine: An opioid analgesic often combined with non-opioid analgesics, like acetaminophen or aspirin, to enhance pain-relieving effectiveness. - Tramadol: This is a centrally-acting analgesic with weak opioid properties and additional non-opioid mechanisms that work in managing pain. Again, patients should follow dosing guidelines and report any concerns regarding side effects or insufficient pain relief to their healthcare providers. Step 3: Moderate to severe pain When pain becomes more intense and reaches a rating of 7-10, healthcare professionals will prescribe strong opioids to help manage the severe pain. Some examples of strong opioids at this step include: - Morphine: A potent opioid analgesic, morphine is commonly used for managing severe pain. It is available in both short-acting and long-acting formulations. - Oxycodone: This strong opioid analgesic is also used for treating moderate to severe pain and can be given as controlled or immediate-release formulations. - Fentanyl: A powerful synthetic opioid analgesic, fentanyl is several times more potent than morphine. It is available in various delivery systems, such as transdermal patches or lozenges. - Hydromorphone: Another strong opioid analgesic, hydromorphone is used to treat patients with severe pain. It is available in different formulations, such as extended-release tablets or injectables. While taking strong opioids, patients may still need non-opioid analgesics and/or adjuvant medications, which act as supplementary drugs, to enhance pain relief. These include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and local anesthetics. Additionally, patients should be closely monitored by healthcare professionals for side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and potential dependency. In conclusion, the World Health Organization pain ladder has three primary steps: mild pain (non-opioid analgesics), mild to moderate pain (weak opioids), and moderate to severe pain (strong opioids). It is crucial for healthcare professionals to assess and re-assess patients' pain levels as they progress through the ladder to provide the best possible pain management in each situation."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. Dunant planned the organization with an intention to _ . A) function only in Europe B) stop war C) get the approval for relief work from every country D) show his ability The answer is:","output":"C) get the approval for relief work from every country"},{"instruction":"Ivan Filipovic, venit de la Zagreb, a afirmat \\"Ar fi trebuit să [menţinem] ritmul.

In order to reach the specific conclusion mentioned, various assumptions would have to be made. First, in order to conclude that a white dog is chasing a black dog, we must assume the colors of the dogs involved. The initial statement only states that there are two dogs, but does not provide any details about their color. Dogs can come in various colors and combinations, so guessing their colors without further information is not reliable. Second, the statement that the two dogs are running through a field provides no evidence of one dog chasing the other. They could be running together, racing each other, or playing with a toy. To deduce that one dog is chasing the other, we must assume that the dogs are participating in a chase rather than any other kind of activity. Additionally, the initial statement specifies that the dogs are running through a field, but it does not necessarily mean the field is covered in grass. A field can refer to an open area of land covered with various vegetation types such as crops, wildflowers, or even a barren and rocky landscape. To conclude that the dogs are running across the grass, we must assume the nature of the field's ground cover. To sum up, the statement \\"Two dogs running through a field\\" does not provide enough information to reach the specific conclusion that \\"a white dog chasing a black dog across the grass.\\" This conclusion can only be drawn by making multiple assumptions about the colors of the dogs, their activity, and the characteristics of the field they are in. It is crucial to recognize that these assumptions may not be accurate given the lack of information provided, therefore it is not possible to definitively conclude that the situation in question involves a white dog chasing a black dog across the grass."},{"instruction":"children of parents with a short education attracts mostly to go to the recreation center or engaging in motorsports.

During the accident, a car ran over Mary's foot, but avoided hitting her hand, so the OPT: -foot was fine. -hand was fine.","output":"I choose the story that continues as \\"the hand was fine.\\" The accident occurred so quickly that Mary barely had time to react. Although the car ran over her foot, her instinctive reflex allowed her to pull her hand back just in time, avoiding any harm to her fingers. Step 1: Choosing the story I choose the \\"hand was fine\\" story because it gives more room for the narrative to explore Mary's condition after the accident. It implies that something happened to her foot, and makes the event feel like it had more significant consequences in Mary's life. Step 2: Continuing the story with Mary's reaction After the incident, Mary examined her hand and felt relieved that it was unharmed. She realized how lucky she was to have moved it away from the vehicle just in the nick of time. However, her attention now turned to her foot, which wasn't spared from the impact. Step 3: Describing the car accident aftermath Onlookers quickly rushed over to aid Mary, who was in agonizing pain from the weight of the car crushing her foot. While it was apparent that her foot was injured, it would take a doctor's examination to determine the extent of the damage. Step 4: Introducing new challenges Upon arriving at the hospital, Mary was met with a wave of uncertainty. Surgery was required to repair her foot, and she wondered how long it would take before she could return to her normal life. This new challenge would test her resilience and determination in the face of adversity. Step 5: Showcasing personal growth As Mary went through the process of recovery, she learned to appreciate her body's strength and resilience. After weeks of rehabilitation and physical therapy, she began to regain mobility in her foot. This experience taught her to value her health more and cherish the moments she had with complete mobility.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What wrecks Jack's car at the beginning? Movie plot title: 11:14 Movie plot: The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge around two car-related accidents at 11:14 p.m. The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks: Part 1[edit] 11:13 - 11:33 Jack (Henry Thomas), who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it is no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she \\"never uses\\" and because she is friends with the Chief of Police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack and, noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers, getting him to recite the alphabet in reverse from Z to A. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the two people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit. While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over,...

Traveling to the moon: The Arctic Monkeys, a British rock band, do not have any special means of transportation to reach the moon. Currently, only national space agencies (NAS) and a few private companies lead efforts to reach outer space, with moon landings in particular being restricted to government-led missions. Theoretically, if the band members were to receive appropriate permission and training, they could potentially visit the moon on a future mission. 2. Performing on the moon: The lunar surface presents several challenges for performing music, including: a) Lack of atmosphere: The moon has no atmosphere, which means sound waves cannot propagate like they do on Earth. Musical instruments and voices would not produce audible sounds as we know them, making a traditional performance impossible for the Arctic Monkeys or any other band. b) Space suits and movement: The lack of atmosphere also necessitates space suits for anyone visiting the moon, including band members. These suits are bulky, cumbersome, and limit movement. This would make it difficult for the band to play their instruments and sing comfortably. c) Equipment: The band would require specialized equipment that can function in extreme lunar conditions, such as low temperatures, vacuum, and lunar dust exposure. This type of equipment is not only expensive but also currently unavailable. In conclusion, although it is an interesting concept, the statement that \\"The Arctic Monkeys can perform on the moon\\" is not true. The current technological constraints and challenges related to space travel and performance make it impossible for the band to perform on the moon in a traditional manner."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Ian told Donald that he was going to try eating amaranth in order to improve Pick from: (a). Ian diet. (b). Donald diet.","output":"Ian told Donald that he was going to try eating amaranth in order to improve Ian's diet. He had recently heard about the numerous health benefits of this ancient grain and was eager to incorporate it into his daily meals. Amaranth, known scientifically as Amaranthus, is a group of over 60 different species of grains that have been cultivated for about 8,000 years. These grains were once considered a staple food in the Inca, Maya, and Aztec civilizations. Amaranth is classified as a pseudocereal, which means it's not technically a cereal grain like wheat or oats but consumed similarly and has a similar nutritional profile. Ian had been researching various ways to enhance his diet and overall well-being when he stumbled upon amaranth. He was fascinated by its rich history and the various health benefits it provides. Some of the key benefits of incorporating amaranth into one's diet include: 1. High Nutritional Value: Amaranth is an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, including calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium. It is also rich in protein and contains all essential amino acids, making it a complete protein source. 2. Gluten-Free: For individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, amaranth is a great alternative to wheat and other gluten-containing grains. This makes it an attractive option for those who struggle to find nutritious gluten-free options. 3. Promotes Digestive Health: Amaranth is high in dietary fiber, which assists in maintaining healthy digestion. Dietary fiber is crucial for maintaining regular bowel movements, reducing constipation, and promoting overall digestive health. 4. Supports Heart Health: Amaranth contains potassium, which helps balance the body's fluid levels and maintains a healthy blood pressure. It also has low sodium content and contains antioxidants that may decrease the risk of heart disease. 5. Boosts Immunity: Amaranth is packed with antioxidants, including vitamin E and selenium, which may protect the body from harmful free radicals and boost the immune system. 6. Aids in Weight Management: Due to its high fiber and protein content, amaranth can help keep you full for longer periods, reducing the urge to snack on unhealthy foods between meals. Ian shared his newfound knowledge about amaranth with Donald and encouraged him to consider adding it to his own diet as well. He even suggested some delicious ways in which they could both start incorporating this superfood into their meals: 1. Cooked Amaranth Porridge: They could simply cook amaranth in water or milk and enjoy it as a warm breakfast porridge, topped with fresh fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey. 2. Amaranth Vegan Burgers: Ian found a recipe for vegan burgers using amaranth, black beans, and spices, making for a protein-rich and delicious meat alternative. 3. Amaranth Salads: They could add cooked amaranth to their salads, providing a hearty and filling base that would fuel them throughout the day. 4. Amaranth-Stuffed Vegetables: Ian and Donald could try stuffing vegetables like bell peppers or tomatoes with cooked amaranth mixed with other ingredients like beans, vegetables, and herbs for a healthy and satisfying meal. Both Ian and Donald were excited to explore the various ways to incorporate amaranth into their diets and benefit from its numerous health advantages. By doing so, they hoped to improve the quality of their lives while enjoying delicious and nutritious meals."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},E={key:1};function z(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
