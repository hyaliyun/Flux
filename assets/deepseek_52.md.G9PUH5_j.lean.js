It is important to consider these potential scenarios to better understand the individual's journey. [a]. They may have been rejected from the church: In some cases, the person may have been asked to leave the church if their presence presented any potential risk or disturbance to other members, which would depend on the specific church and its practices. In this case, they may have had to seek refuge elsewhere or confront their issues without the support of the church community. [b]. They may have been able to turn their life around: Seeking refuge in the church could have provided the individual with the support, guidance, and resources needed to take significant steps toward changing their life for the better. They may have found a sense of direction and purpose by engaging in church activities, connecting with like-minded individuals, and participating in spiritual practices. This could have empowered them to make better choices, address underlying issues, and find lasting recovery and healing. [c]. They may have been served food and warmth and sent on their way: Some churches provide food, clothing, and temporary shelter to those in need. In this scenario, the person may have received physical assistance and a brief respite from their struggles before being sent on their way. While this would not directly address the underlying issues they face, it could have given them the strength and hope to continue searching for longer-term solutions and support. [d]. They may have rejected the church's beliefs: Although the individual sought refuge in the church, they might not necessarily have agreed with the religious beliefs or practices specific to this community. In this case, they may have appreciated the support and help received, but ultimately decided to continue their search for healing elsewhere. This could involve exploring alternative religious or spiritual beliefs, seeking secular resources, or engaging in personal development activities. In conclusion, the outcome after seeking refuge in the church would have largely depended on the individual's personal choices, the specific church community, and the nature of the support and resources provided. These potential scenarios offer several possible paths that the individual might have taken in their quest for healing and recovery after finding temporary solace in the church."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: \\"Cluj-Napoca National Theatre\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

I‚Äôm finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find anything to praise‚Äù. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I‚Äôm gibbering ‚Äì what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process.

Fortunately, I‚Äôve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students.

They are not the same. Loneliness is subjected to you by other people. It can make you feel sad or miserable. Solitude, on the other hand, can be a time of rejuvenation and exploring the self. Here are just a few benefits of spending time alone: Your brain has a break to rest and reboot. You are more capable of being productive. You learn more about yourself during moments of solitude. You have a better opportunity to problem-solve and weigh your options. You have an improved perception of yourself and therefore choose more healthy relationships. Take baby steps. If you are a person who tends to think solitude is boring or uncomfortable, it may not do well to force yourself into long bouts of solitude. In this case, it's better to slowly increase the amount of time you spend alone. If you are always surrounded by others, simply schedule in about 30 minutes of solitude each day for a week. You might choose to drive or walk to work on your own instead of joining someone else. You might go for a hike alone or visit the beach on your own. Just commit to doing a short, 30-minute activity without anyone else present or demanding your attention. Take notes on the experience. Was it better than you anticipated? Were you bored? Why? Write down as many details as possible to better understand your aversion to being alone. Just because you find solitude boring doesn't mean it has to be. If you have periods of alone time approaching, make plans so that your solitude is filled with interesting and fulfilling activities. For example, if you have to stay home on your own for a weekend, you could rent some cool movies, plan to do a creative project, or complete schoolwork during your alone time. To keep your energy revved, gather fun music, books, and other tools to make the time less boring. Preparing for moments of solitude can make the difference between the time dragging by and going by more quickly. Simply fill the hours with things you already love to do.","output":"The article explains the difference between solitude and loneliness, emphasizing the benefits of spending time alone for personal growth and rejuvenation, and offers tips on how to gradually introduce and make the most out of solitude in one's daily life."},{"instruction":"You are given a text of the tweet and a corresponding label whether this tweet is 'Offensive', 'Hate Speech' or 'Neither'.

The phenomenon of reflection can be explained in the context of the electromagnetic nature of light and the behavior of light waves when they interact with different materials. When light strikes the surface of an object, a significant proportion of the light waves encounter a boundary between two mediums with different optical properties (e.g., air and glass). At this boundary, the waves can either be transmitted through the material, absorbed by it, or reflected back into their original medium. Mirrors are specifically designed and manufactured to optimize the reflection process. The key to understanding why mirrors reflect light so effectively lies in the material properties and the structure of a mirror. The surface of a typical mirror comprises two main components: a thin layer of metallic coating (usually aluminum, silver, or gold) and a glass or plastic substrate that provides support for this coating. The metallic coating is responsible for the reflection of light. Metals possess unique characteristics on an atomic level. They have a high density of free electrons, that move about in a ‚Äúsea‚Äù of negatively charged particles. When an incoming light wave strikes the metallic surface, the electric field component of the wave excites these free electrons and causes them to oscillate. As the electrons oscillate, they re-radiate light waves with the same frequency and phase as the original ones, effectively reflecting the light. On the other hand, if light were to travel through the material of a mirror, it would encounter many obstacles. Most metals used in mirrors are opaque and absorb a portion of the incident light, which makes the passage of light through the material difficult. Furthermore, the index of refraction of solid materials is generally higher than that of air, creating a mismatch at the interface that also discourages the transmission of light through the material. Moreover, practical mirrors utilize a protective layer of glass or plastic that covers the metallic coating. Although the substrate itself is transparent, its main role is to shield the reflective layer from physical damage and environmental factors that might degrade its reflective properties. The substrate does make some contribution to the overall reflection, mostly due to internal reflections within the glass or plastic from the multiple interfaces. In summary, mirrors reflect light because the metallic coating's properties facilitate the oscillation of free electrons, leading to the re-radiation of light waves and effectively creating reflected light. In contrast, light traveling through the material of a mirror would face several obstacles, including absorption and the mismatch in the index of refraction, making it difficult for light to pass through."},{"instruction":"Possible tweet sentiments: OPTIONS: [I] negative.

This presses down the sod to ensure good root contact with the soil before watering. Keeping the grass moist during the first few weeks is essential. During this time, the grass roots are establishing and growing. Without plenty of water, this process will slow or halt, and the sod die before it takes. After the first two weeks, water the grass a few times a week to keep it from drying out. Use a sprinkler system to ensure the grass gets evenly watered. Don't wait until the grass looks brown to water it. Do a soil test by sticking your finger into the dirt. If the soil feels moist to a depth of several inches, it's fine. If the dirt feels dry on the surface or to a depth of an inch or two, it's time to water it. Shade-grown grass should be watered less frequently, since it holds dew longer. Water just to the point of puddling, then stop. If the sod lifts up off the soil, it has been overwatered. Mowing before the roots are well established can pull them out of the soil and damage your sod. Wait patiently until the grass is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, and gently pull up on several areas of sod to confirm it is firmly attached. Once the lawn is ready, mow it down to no shorter than ‚Öî of its height, and never below 2 inches (5 cm). Always be sure the mower blades are sharp, straight and clean, Mow in a different directional pattern each time the grass is mowed to ensure even growth. You can bag the clippings, but leaving them on the lawn will actually improve its health, since they act as free fertilizer. Use the same starter fertilizer to dress the lawn after a month has passed. This is necessary to replace the nutrients that may have been washed away during a month of heavy watering. After the first month, you need only fertilize your grass once or twice a season to replace nutrients in the years to come. Keeping up with watering, mowing and fertilizing your lawn is the best way to grow thick, healthy grass, and it's also the best way to keep weeds away. Weeds tend to move in when the grass gets patchy. They're nature's way of covering up bare spots in the ground. If you make sure there aren't bare spots to begin with, you won't have to worry much about weeds. If you notice an area where the sod seems to be dead, replace it as soon as possible. Tear up the old sod, enrich the soil underneath with compost, and add fresh sod, making sure the seams lay right next to the healthy grass on either side. This will prevent weeds from coming up where the sod is dead. Summary:","output":"To help your new grass grow well, you need to press the sod down with a water-filled lawn roller, water the grass regularly to keep it moist, and wait until it's 3 inches tall before mowing it. Make sure to water just enough so the ground doesn't feel dry, but not too much so the sod doesn't lift up. After the first month, use some special food (fertilizer) for the grass 1 or 2 times each season. Keep the grass thick and healthy, which will help to keep weeds away. If some sod dies, fix it quickly by putting down new sod."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own.

Upon searching for prominent and influential Canadians born in 1900 who passed away in 2013, Stompin' Tom Connors, a well-known Canadian country and folk singer, comes to mind as a strong potential candidate that fits the provided description. However, his birth date differs from the one given (he was born in 1936) which makes it less likely to be him. Lorne Greene, a Canadian actor who played the role of Ben Cartwright on the long-running TV show \\"Bonanza,\\" was born in 1915, which also doesn't fit the given birth date. However, he was a renowned Canadian figure who gained international fame, and his information could have been updated around 2013 in relation to various pop culture or media releases. Alternatively, the information may not necessarily refer to an individual who passed away in 2013. Instead, it could reference a significant event or milestone related to their life that occurred in 2013. Without further details, it is challenging to ascribe the given information to a particular person. In conclusion, based on the limited details available, it is nearly impossible to determine with certainty who the information might be about. However, the potential candidates mentioned above, Stompin' Tom Connors and Lorne Greene, could be possibilities, although their birth years don't exactly match the given details. Further information would be necessary to make a more precise guess about the individual in question."},{"instruction":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

There is no indication or evidence within this statement that would lead to the conclusion that the dog is sleeping.

The dog's eyes are closed, and its breathing pattern is slow and steady, indicating sleep. 3. The dog is in a typical sleeping position for dogs, such as laying down on its side, with its head resting on its paws, or curled up in a ball. 4. Observers or caretakers of the dog confirm that it is indeed asleep or has been resting for a prolonged period. In the given statement about the black dog, none of the criteria for concluding that the dog is sleeping are met.

What should I do with my Depression? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Depression is a serious mental health concern that impacts millions of people worldwide. It can cause severe emotional pain and can interfere with your ability to lead a normal life. It's important to note that while I can provide general advice as an AI, your first step should always be to seek advice from a healthcare professional. However, if you're looking for suggestions on how to manage depression, here are some strategies that may help: 1. Seek Professional Help: A mental health professional can diagnose depression and provide you with a variety of treatment options. The most common treatment methods for depression include psychotherapy (also known as mental health counseling), and medications. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been found particularly effective at helping patients to reframe negative patterns of thinking and acting into positive ones. 2. Medication: Antidepressants are medications that can help alleviate the symptoms of depression. They work by balancing chemicals in your brain that affect mood and emotions. It may take some trial and error to find the most suitable medication and dosage for you, and such adjustments should always be done under the supervision of a medical professional. 3. Exercise Regularly: Physical activity increases the production of endorphins, which are natural feel-good hormones. Regular exercise can also improve self-confidence and support better sleep, which are often issues for those experiencing depression. 4. Get Adequate Sleep: Depression often involves trouble sleeping. It's important to establish a consistent sleep schedule and make your sleep environment as comfortable as possible to encourage better sleep. 5. Maintain a Healthy Diet: There is a link between what you eat and how you feel. Studies suggest that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains can help maintain stable blood sugar levels, which in turn can stabilize your mood. 6. Avoid Alcohol and Drugs: These substances can interact with antidepressants and can also intensify feelings of depression and anxiety. 7. Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Methods such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or other stress-reduction techniques can help manage symptoms of depression. 8. Stay Connected: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups, either in person or online. Sharing your feelings with others can help alleviate the feelings of isolation and loneliness that often accompany depression. 9. Limit Exposure To Negative Influence: Negative news, toxic people, or distressing content can aggravate symptoms of depression. Try to limit your exposure to such influences. 10. Keep a Journal: Writing about your thoughts and feelings can be therapeutic. It allows you to vent your negative thoughts and emotions and help you to identify patterns or triggers in your mood. Remember, if you're feeling suicidal, it's essential to reach out to professionals immediately. There are multiple hotlines available worldwide that will provide immediate help. Also, be patient with yourself. Overcoming depression takes time. It's okay to have bad days and not to push yourself too hard. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help. You're taking the right steps by seeking advice and looking for ways to manage your depression. Again, it's critical that you speak with a healthcare professional who can provide you with personal and accurate advice based on your situation and medical history. This is a general guide and may not be completely applicable to your individual condition."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts out of his wardrobe. Kevin is scared and hides as the knight rides off into a forest setting where once his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks back out, the room is back to normal and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw. The next night he prepares a satchel with supplies and a Polaroid camera, but is surprised when six dwarves spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a large, worn map, and are looking for an exit from Kevin's room before they are discovered. They find that Kevin's bedroom wall can be pushed, revealing a long hallway. Kevin is hesitant to join until the visage of a menacing head √¢¬Ä¬ì the Supreme Being √¢¬Ä¬ì appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarves fall into an empty void at the end of the hallway. They land in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars.

They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the spacetime fabric, but instead realized the potential to use the map to steal riches. With the map and Kevin's help, they visit several locations in spacetime, and meet figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Robin Hood; Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. They are unaware, however, that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent being who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map himself so that he can remake the universe to his design.

Step by step answer:","output":"The sentence \\"Two policemen in neon yellow jackets stand while others walk by.\\" does not directly tell us that the two policemen are watching for people to break the law. While it is possible their presence is for law enforcement purposes, the sentence itself does not provide enough information to make that conclusion with certainty. Here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. The sentence mentions two policemen, which tells us that there are two law enforcement officers present. 2. They are wearing neon-yellow jackets, which could suggest that their role is prominent or visible to the public. However, this might just be their attire, and it doesn't necessarily indicate their purpose. 3. The policemen are standing, which could imply that they are observing their surroundings or on guard. Still, this doesn't necessarily mean they are watching for people breaking the law ‚Äì they could be standing for several reasons, such as waiting for someone, handling an earlier incident, or simply taking a break. 4. Other people are walking by the policemen. This detail provides some context but does not offer any insights into the policemen's intentions or focus. In conclusion, although it could be a possibility that the two policemen are watching for people breaking the law, the sentence does not provide enough information to confirm this.

This news comes after Le Monde reportedly obtained a French police report containing statements from Khedache about the robbery. According to the report, Kim was targeted by the gang because of all the jewelry pictures she posted to her social media accounts. He went on to say Kim was also easy to keep track of because of her social media presence. He reportedly told police, The jewels were shown on the internet, and [she said] that she didn‚Äôt wear fakes‚Ä¶ the time she would arrive in France, you just had to look at the internet and you knew everything, absolutely everything. What makes this case even weirder is Khedache apparently claimed the whole robbery was an inside job.

With a Twitter history mostly consisting of emojis to her fans and selfies from around the world, it would be easy to dismiss her social-media posts as somewhat shallow. But amid cookie-cutter approbation from celebrities all over America, it was 36-year-old Kim‚Äôs tweet of a table of statistics to her 50 million followers highlighting the statistical fallacy of President Trump‚Äôs immigration ban, two days after its imposition, that stood head and shoulders above the rest. During the Kardashian clan‚Äôs recent well-publicized holiday to Costa Rica, younger sister Khloe also alluded to the situation back in the U.S., tweeting her 23 million followers that ‚ÄúAll this news breaks my heart‚Äù the day after the ban was introduced. She followed up with a retweeted ACLU poster announcing the organization was working to ‚Äúblock the unconstitutional ban.‚Äù With just the title ‚ÄúStatistics,‚Äù Kardashian let the numbers speak for themselves. And speak they did: The post was retweeted almost 200,000 times and the story was picked up by a flood of news outlets, including BuzzFeed, Fox News, and the London Telegraph. Kim has occasionally touched on politically sensitive subjects in the past, she has been vocal in her support of the campaign for recognition that the massacre of Armenians between 1915 and 1923 by Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) should be classified as genocide. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was a third-generation descendant of Armenian immigrants. How did Trump‚Äôs America welcome the Kardashians back home from Costa Rica?

It has been reported that the family spoke to Customs and Border Protection officials before leaving. A video shows a number of figures exiting the plane, with Kourtney clearly holding 2-year-old Reign in her arms, and Khloe helping Penelope, 4, down the stairs with Mason, 7, following behind.

And I was wondering What does Kai need to do before this? Possible answers: a). get a torch an a matress to sleep; b). watch over Robin all night; c). make sure his up to the task and well rested;","output":"Kai will choose 'c'. Make sure he's up to the task and well rested. The main aim for Kai taking guard is to keep a watchful eye for potential threats to ensure Robin's safety while he sleeps. To perform this task efficiently, Kai must be mentally and physically prepared, alert, and well-rested himself. Before Kai takes his turn to guard, he needs to prepare in several ways: 1. Rest: Given that the task of keeping guard requires substantial mental sharpness and physical resilience, it's crucial that Kai is thoroughly rested prior to his shift. Simply put, he needs to have enough sleep before assuming the role to ensure that he stays awake, alert and responsive throughout his watch. Fatigue could risk decreasing his alertness, thereby compromising Robin's safety. 2. Nutrition and Hydration: As with rest, maintaining an adequate diet and staying hydrated are also crucial to keep up his energy levels. It's important that Kai eats a balanced meal and drinks enough water before his watch, considering he may not get adequate time to do so during the watch. 3. Ensuring He's In Good Health: For optimal functioning, Kai should be in good health. If he's feeling unwell, he may not be as alert, which may risk Robin's safety. If he's feeling unwell, he needs to communicate this and maybe share his responsibilities. 4. Familiarize Himself with the Environment: Kai should get a good understanding of the area where he'll be keeping watch. This includes understanding the terrain, possible threat entry points, and best vantage points for maximum visibility and protection. 5. Equipment Check: Lastly, making sure all the necessary equipment for the guard duty is in good working condition is crucial. This includes weapons (if any), communication devices, and possibly a comfortable chair or blanket to help him maintain vigility comfortably hour after hour. It's important to note that while taking guard, Kai's priority is to ensure that Robin gets his rest and is safe. Kai needs to be diligent, attentive, and ready to act at all times. Therefore, ensuring his own rest and preparation beforehand is an essential step to fulfilling these responsibilities. Tools such as a torch or matress (option 'a') can certainly be helpful for his comfort, but are secondary to his personal preparedness, which comes from adequate rest and self-care (option 'c'). While watching over Robin all night(item 'b') is the actual task, it can only be effectively accomplished if Kai is well-prepared to do so."},{"instruction":"after you rinse with this solution, follow with a plain water rinse.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Set in 1934 Paris, the film opens with Richard di Nardo, a young hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), aka Toddy; Richard dresses, takes money from Toddy's wallet and leaves Toddy's apartment. Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

Before you can even consider oil painting, you must get oil paints. Although there are dozens of brands of oil paint on the market, don't be drawn in by the attraction of budget supplies. OPT: A). Simply buy your paint and you have a pretty good answer as to whether or not oil painting is right for you. Learn the four basic basics of oil painting : Painting is a simple but fun way to paint, and it makes you feel immensely happy. B). If you want to paint a house, for example, you'll need 50% to 50% oil oil. Most oil paints are available at specialty and dwc supply stores. C). Buying cheap, poor quality supplies will make your painting difficult, tedious, and frustrating. Paying a few dollars more will give you paints that require one coat instead of two or three for the same vibrancy and blend-ability. D). Paint manufacturers provide lots of different paints which will help you achieve the unique look you want. Decide what you will use for the work you plan to do.","output":"C). Buying cheap, poor quality supplies will make your painting difficult, tedious, and frustrating. Paying a few dollars more will give you paints that require one coat instead of two or three for the same vibrancy and blend-ability. This investment in higher quality paints will not only save you time and effort but also result in a more satisfying final product. Furthermore, better quality paints tend to have a more consistent pigment composition, which is essential when mixing colors and creating seamless gradients in your artwork. Once you've chosen your paints, it's time to prepare your work space and gather all the necessary tools and materials. In addition to your oil paints, you will need paintbrushes of various sizes and shapes, a palette for mixing colors, odorless mineral spirits or turpentine for thinning and cleaning, linseed oil or another medium to modify paint consistency, and a canvas or other suitable surface to paint on. Make sure your work area is well-ventilated, as oil paintings can release potentially harmful fumes. Before you begin painting, take time to familiarize yourself with the different techniques and styles that are possible with oil painting. Some popular techniques include alla prima, also known as wet-on-wet, which involves applying fresh paint on top of still-wet layers; glazing, where thin, transparent layers of paint are applied over a dry, opaque base to create depth and luminosity; and impasto, which uses thick layers of paint to create texture and dimension on the canvas. As you start working on your painting, remember to begin with an underpainting or a sketch to lay the foundation for your composition. This can be done using a neutral color, such as burnt umber or raw sienna, thinned with mineral spirits. This preliminary stage helps establish the overall structure, values, and proportions of your painting, making it easier to build up layers of color later on. When applying the oil paints, start with thin layers and gradually build up texture and thickness as you progress. Keep in mind that oil paints take a long time to dry, sometimes even weeks to months depending on the thickness of the paint and the mediums used. This slow drying time allows you to continually refine and adjust your painting, blending and modifying colors until you achieve your desired result. Finally, once you've completed your painting and it has dried completely, you may want to apply a protective varnish to seal and protect the surface. This can help prevent yellowing, cracking, or damage from UV rays, dust, and other environmental factors. Be sure to follow the varnish manufacturer's instructions for proper application and drying times. In conclusion, oil painting is an enriching and rewarding art form that yields stunning results when executed with patience and the right materials. By investing in quality supplies, learning various techniques, and taking the time to plan and build up your painting in layers, you'll be well on your way to creating impressive works of art that will stand the test of time."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Now, President Barack Obama, discussing his plans for health care, has vowed to find \\"a cure\\" for cancer in our time and said that, as part of the economic stimulus package, he would increase federal money for cancer research by a third for the next two years.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or‚Äîin some cases‚Äîfor several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Even though considered monogamous, birds sometimes commit extra-pair copulation (infidelity)."},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Mrs. Claus.

The mid-table visitors ended the match with 10 men after David Navarro was sent off in the second half for a foul on Cristiano Ronaldo, but they were well beaten even before he saw red. Ronaldo had put Real ahead after 11 minutes before defender Marcelo put the home side two up just after halftime. An own goal from Nikos Karabelas completed Levante's miserable evening.

Ronaldo showed his heading qualities by rising to meet Angel di Maria's corner to put Real ahead before Benzema hit the post. Marcelo's superlative curling effort on 49 minutes all but settled the affair before Navarro, who was once banned for seven months after a notorious Champions League brawl when playing for Valencia, got his marching orders for the seventh time in his career.

In the first quarter, New York immediately trailed as QB Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Wes Welker for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Jets tied the game with QB Chad Pennington completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles. However, the Patriots retook the lead with Brady completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. On the opening kickoff for the third quarter, New York trailed even more as CB Ellis Hobbs returned the kickoff an NFL record 108&#160;yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, New England continued his onslaught as Brady completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. The Jets would get their last score of the game with Pennington & Coles hooking up with each other again on a 1-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots would take over for the rest of the game as kicker Stephen Gostkowski nailed a 22-yard field goal, while FB Heath Evans ended the game with a 1-yard TD run. With the loss, New York began its season at 0-1 while the Patriots began 1-0. On September 10, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. On September 13, Belichick was officially fined 500,000, while the Patriots were also fined 250,000, and forfeited their first round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. If the Patriots had missed the playoffs, they would have instead forfeited their second and third round selections in the 2008 draft. Goodell said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick is effectively the team's general manager as well as head coach, and exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \\"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Belichick later issued a statement in which he apologized for what he called a \\"mistake\\" in his interpretation of the rules. However, he denied ever using videotape to gain an advantage while a game was underway.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\". - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that... What is the relationship between 'studio wall' and 'adolph von menzel'? A:","output":"Adolph von Menzel is the artist who created the oil painting titled \\"Studio Wall\\" in 1872.

A. falling down B. provide shelter C. bud D. produce fruit E. back yard The best answer is Answer:","output":"B. provide shelter After Robinson Crusoe got shipwrecked, he found himself stranded on an uninhabited island where he had to survive for many years. He relied on the resources available on the island, and one such resource was the huge tree that he encountered. This tree became an essential part of his survival strategy, as it provided him with shelter. Shelter is one of the most basic needs for any living being, and in the case of Robinson Crusoe, it was even more critical given his isolated situation and the uncertain conditions of the island. A suitable shelter would serve several purposes, such as protection from the elements, safety from predators or potential dangers on the island, and a comfortable space to rest and plan for his survival. The huge tree proved to be an ideal shelter for Robinson, as its size, structure, and location offered the necessary protection he needed. Furthermore, the tree's branches and leaves provided natural insulation that could help regulate the temperature inside, which could prove crucial during extreme weather conditions. It also offered Robinson a vantage point to survey his surroundings, assess potential dangers, and look out for any passing ships that might help him get off the island. In this context, the other options presented as possible answers do not align with Robinson's needs and priorities after being shipwrecked: A. falling down: This scenario would not be helpful for his survival. C. bud: While the growth of new leaves or branches might indicate a healthy tree, it would not directly contribute to his immediate survival needs. D. produce fruit: Of course, having a source of food nearby would be beneficial, but it doesn't compare to the importance of having a viable shelter. E. back yard: This term does not apply to Robinson's situation, as he was isolated on an uninhabited island without any proper housing facilities. Given the critical importance of shelter for Robinson Crusoe's survival and the role the huge tree played in fulfilling that need, the best answer to the question is B. provide shelter."},{"instruction":"By.

Bias: Boris Johnson hit back at the political criticism in the newspaper seen in BBC show Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch (right) Bizarre: The newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock as best man. Boris Johnson appeared to compare Nick Clegg to a condom this morning in his latest attack on the Deputy Prime Minister. The Mayor of London said the Liberal Democrat leader was 'there to fulfil a very important. ceremonial function as David Cameron's lapdog come prophylactic. protection device for all the difficult things that David Cameron has to. do that cheese off' the public. The two men, who both take part in regular phone-in shows on LBC 97.3 have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past, with Mr Clegg branding the mayor a \\"slacker\\" for only hosting a monthly call-in on the station while Mr Johnson claimed the DPM was an 'idle bum'. In the opening seconds of the programme a newspaper page spun into view, with the headline ‚ÄòBank gang leave cops clueless‚Äô. But underneath it had a story headlined: Thames to become watery motorway. The story, which could only be read by pausing the programme, said: ‚ÄòA new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink.‚Äô It went on to detail the ‚Äòhair-brained scheme‚Äô to create boats out of the iconic Routemaster bus, which Mr Johnson pledged to bring back to London‚Äôs streets. When asked to explain the plan at an event, the ‚Äòmayor‚Äô in the story ‚Äòwas found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested‚Äô.

Mr Johnson added: ‚ÄòWe doubled the number of passengers on the river and we are actually getting somewhere at last in sorting our aviation capacity problems. ‚ÄòSo whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that‚Äôs what they do, that‚Äôs their raison d‚Äôetre. I don‚Äôt in any way want to discourage them.‚Äô A BBC spokesman said: ‚ÄòSherlock is a fictional drama series, both the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or politically affiliated.‚Äô A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink. The hair-brained (sic) scheme involved chartering disused boats, paying for their conversion into a version of London's famous bus, the Routemaster, but this plan has already foundered after pilot schemes revealed that customers were walking straight off the boat and into the icy currents of the Thames. When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested. He said, \\"Well the fact of the matter is that Londoners need to recognise our great naval history, rather than naval gazing, and this will get the traffic moving while invoking memories of Nelson and the like.

Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael √Ökerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When √Ökerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that √Ökerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and √Ökerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and √Ökerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick D√∂ring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, D√∂ring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before √Ökerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, √Ökerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he..., can you guess it ?

(Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post) Updated 1:53 p.m. Less than eight months after he was acquired by Washington, Martin Erat has asked the Capitals to trade him. ‚ÄúI want to be traded. We‚Äôll see how it goes,‚Äù Erat said following Monday‚Äôs practice in Arlington. ‚ÄúSince day one, I didn‚Äôt get the chance here. I got traded here to be a top-six player but never got the chance, never played more than 15 minutes in here, and it‚Äôs time for me to move on.‚Äù Erat, 32, was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career Saturday night when the Capitals visited the Toronto Maple Leafs, but the veteran winger‚Äôs frustration with the way the team utilized him has been building. The Czech native initially approached General Manager George McPhee to request a trade in early October, while he was toiling away on the fourth line, and he reiterated it again last week. ‚ÄúIt was long coming, starting from the training camp. I never get any chance, any look,‚Äù Erat said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for me to go.‚Äù Erat has a full no-movement clause in his contract and would need to approve any trade, but McPhee said he doesn‚Äôt expect that to be a problem because the winger has been ‚Äúflexible‚Äù and ‚Äúaccommodating‚Äù with what teams he would be willing to move to. McPhee said he has been talking to some teams and is working to find a trade. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always told our players, and our policy for 15 years or so, if you don‚Äôt feel like you fit in, if you feel like it‚Äôd be better for your career to be someplace else, let us know and we‚Äôll try to accommodate you,‚Äù McPhee said. ‚ÄúI admire him for it. He‚Äôs been professional, he came in and he‚Äôs not pointing fingers or anything like that. He said, ‚ÄòThese things happen and it‚Äôs not working out for me. I‚Äôd like an opportunity someplace else.‚Äô No promises on when it happens. We‚Äôll see how long it takes.‚Äù Washington acquired Erat along with fourth-line center Michael Latta from the Nashville Predators at the trade deadline last season in exchange for forward Filip Forsberg, a 2012 first-round draft pick who at the time was the second best prospect in the Capitals‚Äô system. Erat had asked for a trade from the Predators when it became clear they were in rebuilding mode. At the time of the trade, McPhee was looking to add top-six forward depth with Brooks Laich out of the lineup because of a lingering groin injury. But Erat‚Äôs time in the top half of the lineup has been inconsistent, especially with Laich back in the mix this year. Coach Adam Oates has acknowledged multiple times that he‚Äôs struggled to determine where Erat best fits when all the forwards are healthy as well, bringing up questions as to whether it was a shortsighted move. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always believed that you‚Äôve got to give your team the best chance you can give it going into the playoffs,‚Äù McPhee said. ‚ÄùWe were at the deadline, we missed Brooks a lot and didn‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôd be able to complete the season. We made a deal to help the team because you never know what year it‚Äôs going to be that your team advances and goes all the way. ‚ÄúYou want to give your team the best opportunity possible, because you can‚Äôt have the guys work their guts out all year and then not help them out at the deadline if there‚Äôs something there to help them with. So we made that deal. No regrets. We did what we had to do then, and we‚Äôll do what we have to do now.‚Äù In 13 games with the Capitals last year, including the regular season and playoffs, Erat skated more than 18 minutes twice and recorded only one goal and two assists. When this season began and Washington had a full complement of forwards, Erat played on the fourth line for the first seven games, saw the lowest ice time in his 11-year career and voiced his frustration with the role Oates gave him. Erat saw time on both the first and second line in the 16 other games he appeared in this season, with all of his six assists occurring when he was in the top half of the lineup, but he has played 17 minutes or more only twice all year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the way it goes, they just give me straight signal like I don‚Äôt fit here,‚Äù Erat said. ‚ÄúFor me, time to go. It‚Äôs black and white. It‚Äôs time for me to go.‚Äù Said Erat‚Äôs agent, Michael Deutsch: ‚ÄúMarty had the highest of hopes when he was traded to Washington, it was high on his list. He really expected that it would work out based on the talent level of the players in the organization, but for whatever reason it hasn‚Äôt worked out. Marty apparently doesn‚Äôt fit in and he‚Äôd like to move on to a place where he‚Äôd be a better fit.‚Äù Erat‚Äôs current contract, which carries a 4.5 million cap hit, runs through the 2014-15 season but his salary is 3.75 million this season and 2.25 million the next. Although teams can retain salary of a player in order to facilitate a trade, McPhee said he would not consider keeping any of Erat‚Äôs salary in a move.

A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip.

The person asking this question wants to know if they can find or make cookies that can be considered healthy. Question 2: \\"Which food is healthy?\\" This question is much broader in scope. It's asking for information about healthy food options in general, without specifically referencing cookies. The person asking this question is looking for guidance on which foods they should choose to maintain a healthy diet. Now, let's compare the meanings: On the surface, they seem to be related because they both address the topic of healthy food options. However, they are not the same, as their focus and intent differ. The first question is more specific and focused on healthy cookies, while the second question is about healthy foods in general. The first question assumes that there might be a healthy type of cookie, while the second doesn't imply any particular food item.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly ‚Äúleaking‚Äù blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she‚Äôd made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn‚Äôt keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night. The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine.Internet users can read the full study,free of charge,at plos.org.

This is because a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger, leading people to consume more calories and potentially gain weight. Specifically, individuals who sleep less than five hours a night have 15% higher blood levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, and 15% less of the hormone leptin, which promotes feelings of fullness.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career.

Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering.

The scramble was driven by several factors, including economic, political, and social forces. The Industrial Revolution had created a massive demand for raw materials and new markets in European countries, and Africa, with its vast untapped resources, presented a lucrative opportunity for expansion. Additionally, the colonization of Africa was seen as a way to enhance national prestige and power, as European nations engaged in rivalries to increase their global influence. The Scramble for Africa began in earnest with the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, which was organized by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The conference aimed to regulate the colonization process and avoid conflicts between European powers, primarily by establishing ground rules for claiming territories and asserting control in Africa. No African representatives were present at the conference, illustrating the complete disregard for the rights and autonomy of the indigenous people. During the Scramble for Africa, the entire continent (with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia) was divided among European powers. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Italy were the leading colonizers, with each nation seeking to maximize its share of the continent. The process of colonization had devastating consequences for the people of Africa. European powers imposed harsh control over their territories, often exploiting and brutally repressing the local populations. The indigenous people were subjected to forced labor, forced relocation, and the loss of their lands and resources. The borders drawn by the Europeans frequently cut across existing ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions, leading to conflicts that persist to this day. Moreover, European colonizers systematically undermined local cultures and traditions in favor of the colonizers' languages, religions, and customs. Despite the widespread exploitation, resistance to colonization took root in many parts of Africa. The new borders and European control of resources sparked wars, uprisings, and resistance movements across the continent. Colonized people employed various tactics, from diplomatic engagement to armed struggle, in their attempts to reclaim their lands and regain self-determination. The Scramble for Africa marked a significant chapter in the history of European imperialism and had lasting consequences for the African continent and its people. The political, social, and economic ramifications of colonization can still be felt today, as African countries continue to grapple with the complex legacy of European domination."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Bunty and Babli are two avid dreamers.

'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

The eldest son, Garc√≠a, became king of Le√≥n. The second son, Ordo√±o, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first Garc√≠a died childless and Le√≥n passed to Ordo√±o. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms. This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies.\\" Answer: A:","output":"Fruela's father was Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias, a prominent king who ruled the Kingdom of Asturias from 866 until his abdication in 910. Alfonso III played a significant role in consolidating the Christian Kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula during a period when the region was under constant threat from Muslim forces. Under his reign, several successful military campaigns were launched against the Moors, and the kingdom experienced a period of relative peace, cultural development, and prosperity. As mentioned in the context, Alfonso III's death led to the partition of his kingdom among his three sons - Garc√≠a, who became the king of Le√≥n, Ordo√±o, who reigned in Galicia, and Fruela, who received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. The fragmentation of the former Kingdom of Asturias ultimately resulted in a series of internal struggles and unstable succession for over a century. However, it is important to note that despite these challenges, the Kingdom of Asturias - later the Kingdom of Le√≥n - managed to persist as an influential power in the region, and its existence played a critical role in the eventual Reconquista, or the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Muslim Moors. In the 13th century, under the rule of Ferdinand III, the Kingdom of Le√≥n was finally united with the Kingdom of Castile, thus forming an even stronger Christian power in the peninsula. In conclusion, Fruela's father, Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias, was a prominent figure in the history of the Christian Iberian Peninsula. His reign laid the groundwork for the continued resistance against Muslim invasions and the eventual reunification of the Christian Kingdoms, which ultimately played a pivotal role in the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Ka-Kui and Yang succeed in winning Chaibat's trust, especially after helping his men destroy a fortified drug production lab in Thailand, somewhere in the Golden Triangle, when Chaibat betrays a number of other drug lords who are conducting a heroin deal with him.The action then shifts to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where Chaibat's wife is being held in prison, and is facing the death penalty. However, Chaibat needs to keep her alive because she knows the secret codes to his Swiss bank account, and she will not reveal them to anyone but her husband.More difficulties arise when Ka-Kui happens to run into his girlfriend May at a Malaysian resort hotel. She confronts Ka-Kui, and the situation turns into a misunderstanding,... The answer is:","output":"What activity does Ka-Kui engage in while undercover in order to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther and infiltrate the Triad organization in the third Police Story movie?"},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve -23*o + 15*o = 19*o - 810 for o.","output":"To solve this equation, first we need to simplify both sides by combining the \\"o\\" terms. The given equation is -23 * o + 15 * o = 19 * o - 810. Step 1: Combine the \\"o\\" terms on the left side of the equation. -23 * o + 15 * o = -8 * o Now the equation becomes -8 * o = 19 * o - 810. Step 2: Move the \\"-8 * o\\" term to the right side of the equation by adding \\"8 * o\\" to both sides of the equation. -8 * o + 8 * o = 19 * o - 810 + 8 * o This simplifies to: 0 = 27 * o - 810 Step 3: Now we want to isolate \\"o\\" by moving the constant term, i.e., -810, to the left side. We can do this by adding 810 to both sides: 0 + 810 = 27 * o - 810 + 810 This simplifies to: 810 = 27 * o Step 4: Now, we want to solve for \\"o\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 27: 810 / 27 = 27 * o / 27 This simplifies to: 30 = o So the solution for the given equation is: o = 30"},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him. At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine. He spends almost the entire day at home, afraid to go out of the house, only going out once to venture into the \\"colored part of town\\" in order to find a pharmacy to buy \\"the stuff they use in order to make themselves look white.\\" His attempts to change his skin color fail. The next day, he is persuaded to get up and go to work. Things start out well at first, until Jeff is accused of robbery while running alongside the bus to work. The policeman assumes that, since he is a black man, he must have stolen something. During his lunch break, he makes an appointment with his doctor who cannot explain Jeff's condition either. After several calls, the doctor suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor.

Available choices: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. In the first sentence, the speaker mentions that they and someone else were feeling guilty about enjoying the chili after witnessing something. The context of what they saw is not provided, but it's clear that whatever they saw made them feel guilty. This implies a conflict between pleasure from the meal and a sense of moral or ethical responsibility. The second sentence states that they felt good about their enjoyment of the chili. This sentence seemingly contradicts the first sentence, as it expresses a positive feeling about enjoying the chili, whereas the first sentence conveys guilt from the same activity. To make a better assessment, let's evaluate the options: A). Yes: This option would suggest that the second sentence directly follows or is logically implied by the first sentence. In this case, that is not accurate. The first sentence talks about guilt associated with enjoying the chili, while the second sentence is about feeling good concerning the same enjoyment. They represent conflicting emotions. B). It is not possible to tell: This option suggests that there's not enough information to judge whether the second sentence is directly entailed by the first sentence. While that is true in some cases, we do have enough information to determine that the emotions expressed in both sentences are contradictory, which indicates that one sentence does not entail the other. C). No: This option concludes that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, which is accurate. As mentioned earlier, the emotions expressed in the two sentences are not the same and do not support each other. Feeling guilty (first sentence) and feeling good about enjoyment (second sentence) are conflicting emotions. Based on the analysis, the best answer would be C). No, as the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence due to conflicting emotions and opposing ideas expressed in these two sentences."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"The woman in the red jacket looks as if she was buying something from the open air vendor.\\", can we conclude \\"The woman is buying a beautiful bunch of roses from a street vendor.\\"?

Point #1 - Haggle Free?Now if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated. I have this down to a science. I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here]. Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable. I pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE. Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff. Take it down. Do it NOW. I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy.. Winning is what fuels me. Instead, they offered me this non-negotiable price. I tried everything I could. I plead. I whined. I walked out the door (and then I came back). Nothing worked. Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life. My soul.Conclusion: I don't like non-negotiable pricing. Bleh.Point #2 - Prices are insane??Once upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership. Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute. A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!Now buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!! In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty. I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated. My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women. He played the game well. I am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.Kudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey.... Now I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car. Price, honesty, integrity and all that. However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke. This was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that. I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket. I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner. I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car. Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in. I am one with the universe now... I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda. There needs to be much celebration. So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.The showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew). All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in. I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt. I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV. Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom. I really do. Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit. A tiara should do nicely.SummaryDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me. If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul √âmile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.\\".

Lansdale is married to a beautiful woman named Anne (Andrea Marcovicci) and they have a child named Lizzie (played by Mara Hobel). While they are driving, Anne and Lansdale end up behind a slow-moving truck and an impatient driver behind them. In the heat of argument, Anne, who is driving, gets distracted and pulls out from behind the truck. Another truck comes up in the other lane. Anne attempts to get back behind the other truck but the impatient driver has pulled up too far. Lansdale waves his hand to the impatient driver to move back, and when she does not and Anne has to slam on the brakes, his hand is caught behind the truck, which also stops. The hand is severed completely in a bloody, violent scene. Anne attempts to find the severed hand but it is too late. Lansdale then starts a painful adjustment to not having his right hand, which so happened to be his drawing hand. Anne also adjusts to her guilt of being responsible for the accident and tries to get closer with Lansdale. In a separate instance, he attempts to find the hand himself but does find his signet ring that Anne gave him. They move to New York and Lansdale is approached by his friend and agent Karen Wagner (Rosemary Murphy) to co-produce his comic strip with another cartoonist. But when the test boards are discovered marked up, the deal is off and Karen fires Lansdale. Lansdale, however, is certain HE did not mark them up and questions his daughter about the incident. He also loses the signet ring once again. During his recovery, Lansdale discovers that Anne has started moving away from him like before the accident.

But I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. What is an answer for this question: Which town emitted less carbon monoxide? The answer to this question is:","output":"Valley town emitted less carbon monoxide. The provided background information indicates that gasoline-powered vehicles emit various harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of a gasoline-powered car mitigates the harmful effects of these emissions by converting them into less harmful substances. However, the emissions are still present to some extent. Hill town is primarily dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles, contributing to carbon monoxide emissions. In contrast, Valley town has banned all gas-powered vehicles and only allows the use of electric vehicles and horse-and-buggies. Considering that electric vehicles do not produce any tailpipe emissions, including carbon monoxide, and horse-and-buggies produce no engine-based emissions, Valley town will have significantly lower levels of carbon monoxide. There may still be traces of carbon monoxide in Valley town due to various non-vehicle-related human activities and natural sources, but the overall concentration of the harmful gas will be significantly less than in Hill town, where gasoline-powered vehicles contribute significantly to the emissions. Additionally, electric vehicles' energy efficiency and reliance on clean energy sources further reduce carbon monoxide levels by indirectly decreasing the demand for non-renewable energy sources that could potentially generate carbon monoxide during energy production. In conclusion, Valley town, with its prohibition of gas-powered vehicles and encouragement of electric vehicles and horse-and-buggies, is substantially more effective in reducing carbon monoxide emissions compared to Hill town, where gasoline-powered vehicles with their inherent emission issues are prevalent."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the physics. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Q: Problem: how many seconds will a 500 meter long train moving with a speed of 63 km / hr take to cross a man walking with a speed of 3 km / hr in the direction of the train ? Options: a ) 33 , b ) 87 , c ) 30 , d ) 88 , e ) 77 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the speeds of the train and the man into the same units. Since the length of the train is given in meters, we will convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s. Train speed: (63 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = 17.5 m/s Man speed: (3 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = 0.833 m/s Next, we find the relative speed of the train with respect to the man. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the man from the speed of the train: Relative speed = Train speed - Man speed = 17.5 m/s - 0.833 m/s = 16.67 m/s Now we can use the definition of speed, which is the distance traveled divided by the time taken: Speed = Distance / Time In this case, the distance that the train needs to travel is its entire length (500 meters) to completely cross the man. We can rearrange the speed equation to solve for the time taken: Time = Distance / Speed Substituting the values we have: Time = 500 meters / 16.67 m/s = 29.97 seconds Considering the available options, the closest answer is c) 30 seconds. So, the train takes approximately 30 seconds to cross the man.

The baton visited 23 nations and travelled over 63,000 miles (101,000km) before it reached the UK and was carried by 5,000 runners. As this year's relay for the Glasgow Games arrives in Manchester, four people who took part in 2002 reflect on what it meant to be a baton-bearer. The image of Kirsty Howard and footballer David Beckham handing the baton to the Queen at Manchester's opening ceremony is one of the most memorable moments in Commonwealth Games history. Kirsty was born in 1995 with her heart back to front. Aged four, she was told she had just weeks to live. She defied the odds and, breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank, she joined Beckham on the pitch for an England World Cup qualifier against Greece in 2001. Months later, pictures of the six-year-old and the Manchester United captain passing the baton to Her Majesty were beamed around the world. \\"I didn't know that David was going to be there,\\" she recalls. \\"I was just standing there waiting and he came round the corner. He just gave me a hug and we went towards the Queen. \\"The Queen smiled at me. \\"The reaction from friends and family was amazing. I felt honoured to be there and everyone that I know was very proud. \\"It still feels an honour to have been part of it.\\" After achieving 12 GCSEs and raising about √Ç¬£7m for charity, Kirsty is now studying childcare at Manchester College with hopes of one day becoming a teacher. A Falklands War hero and charity fundraiser, Simon Weston is no stranger to public life. When he was asked to take part in the Queen's Baton Relay in 2002, he had no hesitation in saying yes as he \\"thought it would be fun\\". Weston ran in his native Wales and his memories of the event were as much about the attire as the relay itself. He said: \\"There was such a furore going on about the Manchester Games and I thought it would be lovely to take part in it. \\"You don't get to keep the baton. You have to hand it on to somebody else. It is not like the Olympics where everyone gets a torch if you want to buy it,\\" he added. \\"There were a lot of people who were slightly nervous. They had never done anything in the public eye before. \\"I was just treating it as a bit of fun, which it was. It was a good laugh,\\" he said. \\"The weirdest thing about it was the fact that I had to turn up wearing the most hideous tracksuit. It looked like I had been sitting next to an explosion in a paint factory. It provided my family and friends with great mirth.\\" Many people who took part in the 2002 relay were supported by the communities in which they lived. Elizabeth Heathcote was chosen by the Woman's Institute (WI) in Rutland after successfully recovering from a stroke 18 months earlier. Now 67, she reflected: \\"We were supported by lots of WIs. They decided it was nice that I had fully recovered and they asked me if I would represent them. \\"It was a great honour and over so quickly.\\" Elizabeth also has memories of the uniform worn by the baton-bearers. \\"It was a very bright outfit. They could see us all coming,\\" she joked. \\"It was something very different, something that I will probably never do again. I have done a few things in the WI but I think that was one of the highlights. \\"It is all part of life's sweet tapestry.\\" Claire Hewitt, who in 2002 was a 30-year-old living in the Tooting, south London, was nominated in secret by her neighbour Ian Fenn. \\"I got a parcel through the post. It said: 'Congratulations, you are going to be a baton relay runner. Here is your outfit.' \\"I had no idea what was going on at all.\\" Claire was put forward for welcoming Ian to the area. She now lives with her family in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and co-owns a software development company. Claire, like other runners, ran 500 yards (457m) with the 2002 baton. One of the distinctive features of that baton was an LED sensor that detected the pulse of the person who held it. She added: \\"I am not one of life's sporty people. I remember thinking: 'God, can I even run that far.' \\"I went out for a little test-run in a park in Windsor to check I could. It had a light inside that kept pulse with your heartbeat. \\"It is obviously quite exciting and a bit surreal. I am sure there are people who are far worthier than me. It was one of life's experiences - one to tell the grandchildren about. \\"I have kids now, and I think they would be interested to see my uniform in the loft.\\" The Queen's Baton Relay has been the traditional curtain-raiser for the Commonwealth Games since 1958. Every baton is different, and this year's relay began last October in London. It has travelled around the Commonwealth and has been held by thousands of children and athletes who will compete in Glasgow later this summer. Since the baton arrived back on the British Isles earlier this month in the hands of Olympic medallist Tom Daley, it has toured the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Wales. It will travel around England from Saturday until 13 June before it spends 40 days in Scotland. Just like it did in 2002, it will then play a key role in the opening ceremony of the Games. The BBC will be across the relay with rolling live video online every day when the baton is in Scotland. Summary:","output":"In 2002, there was a special event called the Jubilee Relay before the Manchester Games. A baton traveled through 23 countries and was carried by 5,000 runners before it arrived in the UK. One memorable moment was when a little girl named Kirsty Howard and the famous football player David Beckham handed the baton to the Queen. The Queen's Baton Relay has been a tradition since 1958, and it happens before the Commonwealth Games.

Let's break it down: 1. \\"Various\\" translates to \\"Diverse\\" in Romanian language. The word \\"diverse\\" refers to a variety or wide range of things or items that somehow are related or belong to a specific category. 2. The word \\"sources\\" translates as \\"surse\\". \\"Surse\\" refers to the origin of something received or obtained. It could indicate the starting point of a story, information, or resource. Therefore, \\"diverse surse\\" together refers to a wide variety of origins of certain information or data. 3. The dates \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" remains the same. In Romanian, just like in many other languages, the dates are represented the same way with the day, month, and year format. So, \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" would still be \\"16/02/07-23/02/07\\" in Romanian. Therefore, the full sentence \\"Various sources ‚Äì 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" translates to \\"Diverse surse ‚Äì 16/02/07-23/02/07\\" in Romanian. Please note that punctuation usage, like the dash (-) used here, remains standard across many languages, including Romanian. Please, bear in mind that if you want this phrase to perfectly fit the particular context, especially in a formal, academic, or professional document, it is advisable to seek advice from a professional translator or native speaker as some meanings in translations can be lost or different based on various factors like locality, culture or even modern language slang and nuances."},{"instruction":"This article: The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate.

For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 3.26). A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means ‚Äúcell drinking‚Äù and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (Figure 3.26). A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain substances (Figure 3.26). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of receptor-mediated endocytosis is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptormediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood. Q: What is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell?

Question: Europe and China had exposures do what? Context: To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity‚Äîor rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges‚Äîenriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene. Answer:","output":"Europe and China had exposures to important Cretaceous deposits."},{"instruction":"Given a scientific passage and an answer, generate a question for the given answer. Passage: The rectum (Figure 16.6) stores feces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. The anus is an opening at the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters regulate the exit of feces, the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary. Accessory Organs The organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. Accessory organs add secretions and enzymes that break down food into nutrients. Accessory organs include the salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gall bladder. The secretions of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to food consumption. The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays an important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood. The liver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fats in the duodenum. The liver also processes the absorbed vitamins and fatty acids and synthesizes many plasma proteins. The gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. The pancreas secretes bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidic chyme and a variety of enzymes for the digestion of protein and carbohydrates. Answer: peristaltic","output":"Task: Create a question based on the given passage and answer. Simple steps: 1. Read and understand the passage. 2.

The passage discusses the digestive tract, accessory organs, and their functions. 2. The part of the passage related to the answer 'peristaltic' is: \\"The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination.\\" 3.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more demand happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If there is an increased demand on the body, requiring greater lung capacity, the perturbation can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. This increased demand may arise from activities such as exercise, high-altitude living, or disease severity in individuals with lung or heart problems. Several adaptations and physiological responses come into play to cope with the increased oxygen demand, enhancing lung capacity, and maintaining efficient gas exchange. Direct effects on the respiratory process: 1. Respiratory rate increase: To meet the higher oxygen demand, the body will increase the respiratory rate. Breathing becomes more rapid, ensuring more air is taken into the lungs for oxygen exchange to occur. 2. Diaphragm and intercostal muscles strengthening: With increased demand, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which aid in inhalation and exhalation, become stronger. This enables them to contract and relax more effectively during the breathing process, facilitating greater lung capacity. 3. Improved lung elasticity: The lungs may become more elastic as a result of increased demand, allowing them to expand more effectively and accommodate a larger volume of air during inhalation. This enhances lung capacity and results in greater oxygen uptake and CO2 removal. 4. Alveolar capillary remodeling: An increase in demand for lung capacity can stimulate the growth of additional capillaries around the alveoli. This results in a larger surface area for gas exchange, enabling more oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream and more CO2 to be excreted. Indirect effects on the respiratory process: 1. Cardiovascular adaptations: The heart is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body. To accommodate increased oxygen demand, the cardiovascular system may undergo certain adaptations, such as increased cardiac output (the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute) and increased stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped with each heartbeat). These changes ensure that sufficient oxygen is delivered to the body's tissues. 2. Hemoglobin concentration: To increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, the body may increase the concentration of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for binding and transporting oxygen in red blood cells. This allows for greater oxygen transport to the body's tissues, even if lung capacity remains the same. 3. Mitochondrial adaptations: The cells' powerhouses, mitochondria, are responsible for producing energy through aerobic respiration. With an increased demand for oxygen, the body might increase the number and efficiency of mitochondria. This enhances their ability to use oxygen effectively, ensuring that the tissues receive the necessary energy to function. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of increased demand on lung capacity does indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The body is well-equipped to adapt to such changes, making several physiological adjustments to ensure efficient oxygen transport, gas exchange, and energy metabolism even under challenging conditions."},{"instruction":"Making a tuna salad sandwich on toast.

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712‚Äì1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible‚Äîthe younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals‚ÄîLeopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Sentence 2: Nye likes to read and it is one of his hobbies. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step-by-step: 1. In the first sentence, we learn that Nye walks over to look at a display of reading matter (books, magazines, or other materials), and his interest is visibly aroused. This indicates that there is at least an initial interest or curiosity in reading matter from Nye's side. 2. In the second sentence, it is stated that Nye likes to read, and it's one of his hobbies. Now, let's evaluate if the first sentence supports the second sentence: - The first sentence shows that Nye is interested in the reading matter displayed. This is a specific moment where Nye is engaging with reading materials. - The second sentence is a more general statement about Nye's preferences and habits, stating that he likes to read and it's one of his hobbies. Conclusion: The first sentence provides some evidence that Nye is interested in reading, and it is consistent with the idea that he likes to read. However, the first sentence alone cannot conclusively prove that reading is one of Nye's hobbies, as it only presents a single instance of Nye being attracted to a display of reading matter. It's possible that Nye has occasional interest in reading but not necessarily a regular hobby. More information would be needed to confirm if the second sentence is true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The request comes after a series of victims have come forward, accusing multiple professionals in the field of engaging in inappropriate behavior ranging from unwanted advances to outright assault. In response to these claims, Lowry has been outspoken in his belief that a thorough, independent investigation must be conducted to not only address the specific allegations made, but also to scrutinize the overall culture and power dynamics that allow for such behavior to persist. By insisting on an external inquiry rather than an internal review, Lowry hopes to maintain the transparency and impartiality of the investigation. Lowry's call for an independent probe is significant as it highlights the need to take these allegations seriously, without being influenced by internal biases that can often sway the outcome of in-house inquiries. By emphasizing the importance of an external agency or panel of experts to thoroughly review the claims, Lowry demonstrates his commitment to establishing a fair and inclusive work environment for everyone involved in the industry. Furthermore, Lowry's vocal stance on the issue sends a powerful message to others in similar positions of authority, encouraging them to recognize the significance of such allegations and the need to actively address them. By making his intentions clear, Lowry aims to deter the continuation of abusive behavior while motivating organizations to foster a safe space that is free from harassment and discrimination. In addition to calling for an independent probe, Lowry has also expressed his support for the victims who bravely came forward to share their experiences. Recognizing the courage it takes to speak out against abuse, Lowry has praised their strength and conviction, promising to stand by them throughout the process and beyond.

But to be honest, I don't think that map is very useful because it isn't very clear an tailed. In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance.

Article: The future of agriculture must achieve several goals at the same time. First, it now appears that we will have to double world food production in the next 40 years due to population growth, increasing meat consumption and pressure from biofuels . We will also have to reduce the environmental impacts from our farming practices, which have caused widespread damage to soils, ecosystems, waters and even the atmosphere. In fact, agriculture's impacts are as bad as climate change as an environmental concern. Besides, we will have to improve food security for the world's poor. While the Green Revolution of the 1960s made it possible to feed hundreds of millions more people than in earlier eras, the number of the under-nourished in the world has started to rise again. Finally, we will have to increase the recovering ability of agriculture from shocks. Today, our high-efficiency, globalized world has many benefits, but it is vulnerable to destruction, whether from droughts, diseases or sudden price rises. We must start building better food systems to better keep us away from future shocks. Currently, there are two models of agriculture: local and organic agriculture vs. globalized and industrialized agriculture. Each has been strongly supported and severely criticized, but neither of these models, standing alone, can fully meet our needs. Organic agriculture teaches us important lessons about soils, nutrition and pest management. Unfortunately, organic food provides less than 1% of the world's calories, mostly to the wealthy. It is hard to imagine organic farming developing to feed 9 billion. Globalized and industrialized agriculture has benefits of high output and low labor demands. Without it, billions of people would have starved. However, it has come with enormous environmental and social costs, which cannot be sustained. Rather than voting for just one solution, we need a third way to solve the crisis. Let's take ideas from both sides, creating new, hybrid solutions that increase production, save resources... Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Options: A: everyone can afford to enjoy organic food at will B: we will vote to decide which farming system to take C: the writer is quite optimistic about future agriculture D: only experts can find a better agricultural solution Answer:","output":"D: only experts can find a better agricultural solution"},{"instruction":"Kathryn Smith, 23, had a history of self-harm, substance abuse and mental health issues and her pregnancy was not planned, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

New York: Although this city has various neighborhoods and settings, it is generally considered to be urban, bustling, and modern ‚Äì factors that don't align with the quaintness the steak house is looking for. 2.

Donald Trump Jr was promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton at the meeting, his emails show. Mr Trump Jr has only previously acknowledged that a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was present. The president's eldest son has played down meeting, which took place on 9 June 2016, since it was reported this week. But the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Mr Trump Jr, 39, to testify publicly Several congressional panels and federal investigators are looking into claims that Russia meddled in last year's US election in a bid to help Donald Trump. The New York meeting was also attended by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and election chairman, Paul Manafort. It has emerged as the firmest evidence yet of non-diplomatic interactions between Trump campaign aides and Russian figures. House Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi said that there was now \\"cold, hard evidence\\" that the Trump family intended to collude, possibly with Russia, to influence the elections, and that this should be investigated independently. \\"I... call for the revoking of the security clearance for Jared Kushner. It's absolutely ridiculous that he should have... that clearance,\\" she said. During a news conference in Paris, France, on Thursday, Mr Trump said that \\"most people would have taken that meeting\\". \\"Zero happened,\\" the president said. Mr Akhmetshin told the AP news agency he served in a Soviet military unit that was part of counterintelligence, but that he was never formally trained as a spy. In court papers filed in 2015 with the US District Court in Washington DC, where he lives, a mining company accused him of organising a hack on its private records as part of an alleged smear campaign. International Mineral Resources hired a private investigator to follow Mr Akhmetshin to London. The Russian-American was overheard in a coffee shop bragging about arranging the cyber-attack on the firm's computer system, according to court documents. Mr Akhmetshin denied the allegations, and the case was later dropped. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says the Russian government knows nothing about Mr Akhmetshin, the AP reported. Mr Akhmetshin told the Washington Post he became a US citizen in 2009 but retains his Russian nationality. He is a registered lobbyist who has focused in recent years on overturning the 2012 US Magnitsky Act. The law, which froze the assets of senior Russian officials, angered President Vladimir Putin. Mr Akhmetshin told the Washington Post he only accompanied Ms Veselnitskaya to the Trump Tower meeting on the spur of the moment after meeting her for lunch. He said he showed up with her at the Manhattan skyscraper wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Mr Akhmetshin said he and Ms Veselnitskaya were joined by an interpreter. \\"I never thought this would be such a big deal, to be honest,\\" he said. The meeting was set up by Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist for Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Mr Agalarov worked with Donald Trump Snr on staging the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. Emails show that Mr Goldstone promised Mr Trump Jr that Ms Veselnitskaya, whom he described as a \\"Russian government attorney\\", would share damaging information about Mrs Clinton. Mr Trump Jr said it became apparent as they spoke that Ms Veselnitskaya wanted to discuss a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children. But Mr Akhmetshin told the AP that Ms Veselnitskaya informed Mr Trump Jr she had details of possible illicit funds being funnelled to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). \\"This could be a good issue to expose how the DNC is accepting bad money,\\" he said he recalled her saying. According to Mr Akhmetshin, Mr Trump Jr asked her if she had evidence to prove the claim, but the lawyer urged the Trump campaign to research the matter. The president's son appeared to lose interest, said Mr Akhmetshin. \\"They couldn't wait for the meeting to end,\\" he added. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist and former Soviet counterintelligence officer, has confirmed that he was present at a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016.

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

This is the surprising advice of a British cook. One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. \\" I tried to pick it up and it bit me.

However, the degree of positivity or negativity could depend on the individual reader's interpretation and personal preferences. If the reader enjoys action movies, they may perceive this statement as a positive endorsement of the movie, indicating that it is exciting and packed with adrenaline-fueled sequences. On the other hand, if the reader is not a fan of action movies, they may perceive it as a negative remark, suggesting that the movie is formulaic and lacking in depth. To make the sentiment of the statement clearer, it would be helpful to provide more context. Generally, movie reviews offer an evaluation of various aspects of the movie, including the story, acting, special effects, and technical execution. By providing more in-depth information, the reviewer can guide the reader in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the movie, giving them a clearer idea of its overall quality and entertainment value. For example, the sentence could be expanded: Positive sentiment: \\"It looks like an action movie, and it definitely delivers on the thrills with its breathtaking stunts, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and a gripping storyline that keeps you engaged throughout.\\" Negative sentiment: \\"It looks like an action movie, but it disappointingly falls short of the mark ‚Äì relying on tired clich√©s and an uninspired, paper-thin plot that leaves you feeling underwhelmed.\\" These examples make the reviewer's stance clearer, helping the reader identify whether the review is positive or negative and informing their decision about whether to watch the movie."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Worst app I hate it.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"?

A more detailed explanation: When using a more accurate precontained filter, the filtration process might become more efficient, and it could potentially lead to a better extraction of coffee flavors. However, filling more coffee in the filter than 2/3 full could influence the brewing process as well. If there's too much coffee in the filter, this could lead to an uneven extraction, and the final brewed coffee might turn out to be either too strong or not strong enough. Considering both the changes, the perturbation will indirectly impact a step of the process, specifically, the extraction of coffee flavors that happens when hot water passes through the ground coffee in the filter. Although none of the steps in the process are directly altered by using a more accurate precontained filter and filling more coffee than 2/3 full, the result of these changes might affect how well the coffee tastes in the end.

Step 1: Look for the numbers with the same letters (in this case, \\"f\\"). We have 1468*f and -1447*f. These two can be combined because they both have \\"f.\\" Step 2: Combine the numbers by subtracting them. Here's the math: 1468*f - 1447*f = 21*f. So now, we have 21*f - 252 = 0. Step 3: We want to find the value of \\"f\\" that makes the equation true. To do this, we will add 252 to both sides of the equation: 21*f - 252 + 252 = 0 + 252, which simplifies to 21*f = 252. Step 4: To find the value of \\"f,\\" we need to divide both sides of the equation by 21: 21*f / 21 = 252 / 21, which simplifies to f = 12. So the answer is f = 12.

The hypothesis that all members of the board are Republican is not entailed by the premise, which states that no more than six members of the bipartisan board can be from any one political party. To understand this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: No more than six members of the bipartisan board can be from any one political party. This statement establishes a clear limitation on the composition of the board. It implies that the board must consist of members from different political parties, and that no single party can have more than six representatives. As there is a limit to the number of members from a particular political party, the board must have at least some level of representation from multiple parties. This is in line with the term \\"bipartisan,\\" which implies cooperation and compromise between different political parties. Hypothesis: All members of the board are Republican. This hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it claims that the entire board is composed of members from a single political party (the Republican party). If all members were Republican, this would mean there are more than six members from one political party, directly violating the premise's condition. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise sets a clear limit on the number of members from any one political party, while the hypothesis proposes a scenario in which this limit is not respected. As such, the answer is [III] no."},{"instruction":"You dont know what you enjoy doing what your calling or your passion is simply because you stopped trying What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"You don't know what you enjoy doing, what your calling or your passion is, simply because you stopped trying."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In the US, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga.

Possible A: supermarket, home, closet, mart, hardware store Why is \\"supermarket\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Supermarket\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is typically the primary place where groceries are purchased and where shopping bags are readily available. Supermarkets often have multiple options for shopping bags, including plastic, paper, and reusable bags, that customers can use for packing their groceries. It is very common for customers to collect their groceries in a shopping cart before proceeding to check out, where the cashier or even the customers themselves will pack the groceries into the shopping bags. In addition to this, supermarkets frequently sell reusable bags at the entrance or near the checkout counters, which encourages customers to adopt a more environmentally friendly approach to packing their groceries. The other possible answers, such as \\"home\\" and \\"closet,\\" are also somewhat valid, as people may store extra bags at home for personal use.

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Passage: Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet‚Ä¶.\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician. In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with Hoagy Carmichael, Bill Challis and others, who knew and worked with Bix.

Step-by-step rationale: 1. Ice forms inside a cloud: This is the initial stage where water vapor turns into ice particles within the cloud. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges: As the ice particles collide with one another, they transfer charges, leading to a separation of charges within the cloud. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: The charge separation creates a charged environment, which makes the cloud a thundercloud. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: The bottom part of the cloud accumulates a strong negative charge. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: Due to the strong negative charge in the cloud, a positive charge is induced on the ground beneath it, as opposite charges attract each other. 6. This positive energy gathers on the ground: The positive charge at the surface of the Earth concentrates below the negatively charged cloud. 7.

In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"Jefferson avoided Virginia's possible provision of theology at the University of Virginia (UVA) by establishing a system that respected the separation of church and state while still allowing religious expression on campus. He achieved this by encouraging various religious sects to have their own preachers at the university, without providing any government support for a specific Professorship of Divinity. This approach was in line with his Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which established a constitutional ban on state-supported religion. While some argue that this arrangement shows that Jefferson supported a strict separation between church and state, others point to his support for a scheme where students at UVA would attend religious worship each morning as evidence of a more nuanced stance. In conclusion, Jefferson managed to avoid the provision of theology at UVA by creating an environment that welcomed religious expression without directly involving the government in funding or endorsing a particular religious doctrine. By doing so, he demonstrated a commitment to upholding religious freedom, even while navigating the complexities of establishing a new public university."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: Louis Requena/MLB Photos via Getty Images Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday with at least 75 percent of the vote from the Golden Era committee. Former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday with at least 75 percent of the vote from the Golden Era committee. Ron Santo wanted this day for so long, and now that it‚Äôs finally here, he isn‚Äôt. The Hall of Fame call , the one he waited for and agonized over pretty much his entire adult life, came on Monday, but he‚Äôs no longer with us to answer the phone and hear this: ‚ÄúRonnie, welcome to the Hall of Fame.‚Äù And that‚Äôs not right.He was asked once, on one of the many days a new group of inductees was announced and he wasn‚Äôt among them, if he‚Äôd be OK getting a spot in Cooperstown, even if it came after he died. And, in that style that endeared him to generations of Cubs fans, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go in post-humorously.‚Äù Of course, he meant posthumously, but then an E-5 on words was part of what made Ron Santo.I spent seven years in Chicago, covering the Cubs and White Sox, and to this day say the most interesting person I‚Äôve ever covered was Ozzie Guillen. The most impressive was Ron Santo. And for so many people, Ron Santo didn‚Äôt belong in the Hall because he was one of the best third basemen of his generation. They didn‚Äôt want him in because of his 342 homers, 1,331 RBIs and 2,254 hits. I mean, those were good enough reasons. But so many of them wanted him in because he was Ron Santo.I know it‚Äôs not the best baseball argument, and that writers who serve as gatekeepers to Cooperstown shouldn‚Äôt vote with their hearts with something as important as entry into the Hall of Fame. But all those people that wanted Ron Santo in for being simply Ron Santo, I get it. So no, this isn‚Äôt a piece about the numbers and the on-field credentials.I admit that when I first arrived in Chicago, I didn‚Äôt understand what Ron Santo meant to the city, to these people, to Cubs fans and to those suffering from diabetes. To me, he was a shrieking, name-mispronouncing homer cluttering up a radio broadcast. Before his health rapidly declined, Santo took a few days off from Cubs broadcasts. In his absence, I wrote a column for the small suburban newspaper for which I worked, a piece saying what a break it would be for his partner, the classy Pat Hughes, to have a few days off from Ronnie‚Äôs malapropisms, from the recaps of his between-innings trips to the bathroom, from his butchering of the English language. I recalled some of his classic mistakes. (Note: Let‚Äôs get something straight, I wrote this before the leg amputations, before the bladder cancer, before the suffering reached the unimaginable levels it would in the years to come. I mean, even I‚Äôm not heartless enough to pick on someone fighting debilitating illnesses). People wanted me fired. Or shot. Or fired, and then shot. And you know, they had a point. All these years later, I regret nothing more in my professional life than that column. I was young and stupid. Mostly, I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong.No, these aren‚Äôt baseball arguments, but if you spent time around Ron Santo, you quickly realize you don‚Äôt think with your mind, you think with your heart. You don‚Äôt think the radio broadcast going off the rails is ridiculous; you think it fits, it‚Äôs perfect. ( Here‚Äôs a brief, but oh-so-perfect sampling ).Ron Santo was the crazy grandfather who overlooked your flaws; seriously, how else could someone love some of those awful Cubs teams the way Ronnie did. He was the voice of a fight, raising millions upon millions for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). He was a stubborn patient, the one who wouldn‚Äôt let the disease -- actually, the diseases -- keep him from living his life. I saw no-hitters and 60-homer seasons in Chicago; I saw a team on the other side of town win a World Series. Yet, the achievement that stands above all else was watching Ron Santo, on two prostheses, work his way down that steep flight of stairs into the Cubs‚Äô clubhouse, finally get to the bottom and smile. Not complain. Never complain. Smile. Walk through the clubhouse and say hello to reporters and players and clubhouse staff, asking ‚ÄúHow you feeling today, big boy?‚ÄùOh, I saw or heard about some funny ones, too. About the hairpiece catching on fire in the booth at Shea Stadium. The countless drinks he spilled on his notes or the fax machine in the broadcast booth. And, oh, the mess he made with words. OK, so the man could never remember my last name. And so, to see what kind of torture we could put him through, his partners handed him a piece of paper during a broadcast so he could wish me happy birthday on the air. He looked at the 15 letters and fought for 10 minutes -- live on radio -- that there‚Äôs no way that ‚ÄúPietruszkiewicz‚Äù was a real last name. I still have the tape. Listening to everyone laughing in the background might be the best birthday wish I ever got.In a city that loved people with one name -- Jordan Ditka Sweetness Ernie -- it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say the name they loved the most was Ronnie.And in his life, too short but incredibly well lived, he wanted two things more than anything -- a World Series title for his Cubs and to hear someone say, ‚ÄúRonnie, welcome to the Hall of Fame.‚ÄùI wish we could all see him push himself out of his chair on that stage this summer, surrounded by Hall of Famers -- fellow Hall of Famers -- and fumble and mumble and shriek his way through a speech that wouldn‚Äôt leave a dry eye anywhere in Cooperstown.Yes, this is a happy day. It‚Äôs a sad one, too.Nick Pietruszkiewicz is an editor for ESPN.com Follow him on Twitter at npiet_ESPN ||||| Oh, yesssssss! The guy who immortalized the ‚Äúoh, nooooo‚Äô‚Äô call when Brant Brown dropped that fly ball is heading to the Hall of Fame. Ron Santo is joining Cub teammates Ernie Banks Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins in baseball‚Äôs Hall of Fame. He was elected by the Veteran‚Äôs Committee in so-called Golden Era (1947-72) balloting announced Monday morning.While Cub fans can rejoice, the news wasn‚Äôt good on the other side of Chicago. Latin American pioneer and White Sox fan favorite Minnie Minoso was bypassed for the Hall in voting.The 16-member committee included Williams, former White Sox general manager Roland Hemond and Chicago Tribune baseball writer Dave Van Dyck. The voters reviewed 10 candidates, each of which needed 12 votes for election.Santo received 15 votes, according to Hall Chairman Jane Forbes Clark. Jim Kaat was second in voting with 10 votes, followed by Minoso and Gil Hodges with nine each and Tony Oliva with eight.Also on the ballot were executives Buzzie Bavasi and Charlie Finley, along with perennial All-Stars Luis Tiant, Ken Boyer and Allie Reynolds.Santo‚Äôs election is bittersweet as it comes one year and two days after his death. He battled diabetes throughout his life, including in a 15-year career in which he hit .277 with 342 home runs and 1,331 RBIs while winning five consecutive Gold Gloves.Santo, an All-Star in nine seasons, is ranked as the sixth best third baseman of all time by baseball analyst Bill James but previously had been bypassed for the Hall by the Baseball Writers Association of America and the Veterans Committee when it was comprised almost exclusively of living Hall of Famers. |||||","output":"Ron Santo, a former Chicago Cubs third baseman, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Monday.

Here is a hypothesis: Arbitrageurs have very little say in the future of companies. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the conclusion can be drawn from the premise, we need to analyze the premise and the hypothesis step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that putting the future of a company in the hands of arbitrageurs (through a tender offer) is an extreme case of prioritizing property rights. In other words, the premise suggests that relying on arbitrageurs to determine the future of a corporation is a negative action, as it excessively values property rights. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that arbitrageurs have little influence on the future of companies. This means that, according to the hypothesis, the actions and decisions made by arbitrageurs do not significantly impact the trajectory and growth of corporations. Step 3: Assess the connection between the premise and the hypothesis Now, we must determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. We do this by examining the logical connection between the two statements. Based on the premise, it is implied that arbitrageurs have significant control over the future of a corporation, as tender offers are a way of giving control to arbitrageurs. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that arbitrageurs have very little say in the future of companies. Step 4: Evaluate the compatibility of the premise and the hypothesis The premise and the hypothesis are contradictory because the premise implies that arbitrageurs have significant control over the future of a corporation when a tender offer is involved, while the hypothesis argues that arbitrageurs have limited influence on companies. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true, as the two statements are incompatible."},{"instruction":"How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How do you make drinks cold quickly?","output":"Making drinks cold quickly can be achieved through several methods, each with varying levels of efficiency. Here is a step-by-step guide to some of the most effective techniques: 1. Ice and Salt Water Bath (Fastest method): a. Fill a large bowl, bucket, or cooler with ice cubes or crushed ice. b. Add cold water to the container, making sure it covers about half of the ice. c. Mix in a generous amount of salt (preferably rock or kosher salt) to the ice-water mixture. The salt reduces the freezing point of water, allowing the solution to become colder than regular ice water. d. Submerge your drink in the saltwater bath, ensuring that it is fully surrounded by the ice. e. Gently stir your drink in the ice bath or swirl the ice around it to maximize contact with the cold mixture. f. Leave the drink in the ice bath for at least 3-5 minutes for cans or small bottles, and 7-10 minutes for larger bottles, checking frequently until the desired temperature is reached. 2. Wet Paper Towel Method: a. Dampen a sheet of paper towel with cold water, ensuring that it is saturated but not dripping. b. Wrap the wet paper towel around your drink, entirely covering its surface. c. Place the wrapped drink in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the container and the desired temperature. Check regularly to prevent freezing. d. Remove your drink from the freezer once it has reached the appropriate coldness. 3. Spin and Chill (with caution): a. Place your drink in the freezer and set a timer for 1-2 minutes. This will help bring down its temperature slightly. b. Remove your drink from the freezer and partially submerge it in an ice bucket or bowl filled with ice. c. Carefully spin your drink along its horizontal axis for 30-60 seconds. The spinning motion helps to cool down the drink more evenly and quickly by convection. d. Be cautious with carbonated drinks, as spinning them may cause pressure buildup. In this case, you can try gently rotating the containers in the ice. e. Check the temperature of your drink and repeat the spinning process if necessary until it reaches the desired coldness. 4. Using a Blast Chiller or Instant Beverage Chiller (Requires specialized equipment): a. Obtain a blast chiller or instant beverage chiller, which are designed to cool drinks quickly. b. Place your drink in the designated area of the appliance according to the manufacturer's instructions. c. Set the timer as specified by the device's user manual (usually 2-10 minutes, depending on the appliance and drink size). d. Wait for the appliance to cool your drink to the desired temperature. Regardless of the method you choose, always remember that regular monitoring and gentle handling are crucial to ensure the desired results and avoid over-freezing or pressurization.

Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off. Derek's friend Ewan is unable to help him, and he is given official notice of his firing by his coworker \\"The Reaper\\". Derek takes his things and is escorted downstairs by company security, dejected and afraid of being disbarred. Answer:","output":"In the article, the person who gives the firing notice to Derek Cho, the man who can't find his favorite mug, is nicknamed \\"The Reaper.\\" This coworker delivers the official notice of Derek's termination after Derek confronts his superior, Cara, also known as \\"The Siren\\", for blaming him for a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp and taking his mug.

Your task is to generate a short summary for this text. The summary must include a situation which caused humor. The summary should be one or two sentences long. Text: some people in an askreddit thread wanted the full story of this, so here it is. as with most tifus this didn't happen today but instead, about 2-3yrs ago. some background first: so, i'm 17 at the time, larger build, about 6' and 200lbs, that's about 90kg for you non-americans, in high school in a small small town of about 7k people, really really unpopular, like, the most unpopular one, people liked to pick on me, i liked to hit people who picked on me. the principal was always cool, he was on my side ninety percent of the time, i was never able to get out of punishment that way, but hey, reduced sentence is fine with me. senior year, that changed, welcome to the new principal, who hates my guts. so, the entire year, i've got to deal with this harpy of a principal that will crucify me for the slightest transgression, i do my best to annoy her, she does her best to slap me with the best punishment she can. a sort of hate/hate relationship. i carry around my 1.7 gpa, avoid most homework, and generally not give a fuck. well, one day, i'm waiting with some friends (and people who are alright with me, but don't necessarily like me) before school in a park right next to the school, smoking cigarettes before class starts, and this cute girl (henceforth known as cutie) that i know comes up to me, and asks if i would protest with her in the school, i figure \\"sure, what the fuck, i'll 'stick it to the man' and protest with her\\" and i'm thinking there's a pretty fantastic chance of getting laid if this goes down right. she hands me a sign to hold and a mask to wear, i put it on, school starts, we wait a couple minutes, and then enter the school, she starts shouting something about something, honestly, i don't even remember because right about that time i'm thinking maybe this wasn't such a good idea. this continues for about five minutes until we are about halfway down a hallway when the schools resource officer calls out to us. he's a pretty chill dude, and friends with all the students, including me. he tells us it's time to stop the protest, and come to the office. me and the cutie back up, hesitant to go with him. he approaches, as officers do. cutie and i are both figuring out if it's better to give up, or book it when he gets within about five feet of us. officer asks me to give him the sign, i refuse, to this day i'm not a hundred percent why, and in response, he grabs me, shoves me into a corner between the lockers and the hallways wall. my whole fight/flight response is roaring and ready to take me the fuck out of there. i resist, full of adrenaline, nicotine, and monster, trying to get out of the corner. now, only two things were in my head at that moment: this dude is attacking me i need to get the hell out of dodge i try to slip past him,he grabs me, i fall, he comes with me. cutie is just standing there, watching all of this go down. i try to clamber to my feet, but mr. officer isn't letting go, he's got my leg with his vice grip hands and won't let go. he climbs up on top of me trying to restrain me, i quite literally (to the amazement of several military recruiters) do a push-up with this cop on my big, and mind you, he's got about 40lbs on me. now, at this point, two neurons just connected inside of cuties brain, and she decides it's all gone too far, she tells me to give up, and now two neurons connect in my brain and i realize that at this point, i should just give up, like she says, because there's no way that me escaping is going to make things better. i flatten out on the ground, and place my hands in a position behind my back to make it easier for him to cuff me, because i just know after that fiasco this dude wants to put cuffs on me. so, officer cuffs me, and i'm laying here while he radios for suv with a cell in it to meet him out front. about this time, i look up and see harpy mcharpyface walking down the hall towards us with the biggest shit-eating grin i've ever seen. she just got her ammunition to boot me out. i lock eyes with her and the only thing that comes out of my mouth is \\"wow, you're a total bitch from this angle too!\\" because, well, why not? i get walked to the front by the officer, all the while apologizing to him, because he's my friend, and i know he didn't really want to do that. after about five minutes of standing around in the worlds most uncomfortable handcuffs the suv arrives. i'm forced into it. having your hands cuffed too tight behind your back is seriously uncomfortable, but being forced to sit in a cramped seat with your hands cuffed behind your back is even worse. we arrive at the police station in only a few minutes, because it's just a few blocks away. i am ushered through reception, uncuffed, and thrown in a small holding cell with a single yellow chair. that yellow chair wasn't comfortable, nothing about being arrested is comfortable, don't do it. i sit there for two hours. eventually, the door opens, i'm recuffed, and taken to a police cruiser. cue more sitting in a car in the most uncomfortable position. we arrive at the juvenile detention facility in the bigger city nearby, and i am left in their care, uncuffed. i am handed a set of clothing, and a tiny bit of soap before being ushered into a small shower room. here, i get to experience my first ever strip search, how fun! i strip down, show the dude i'm not hiding anything in my butt, and he leaves me to shower and get dressed, which i do quickly. i get led to a cell where i will wait in my brand new orange outfit until the courthouse is ready to talk to me. i sit there for another two hours, get the worst sammich i've ever had courtesy of the county, and am escorted out in, i shit you not, leg shackles, handcuffs, in front this time, and a stomach restraint, to which my cuffs are attached. i get driven to the courthouse by a random officer, and we take the elevator up to the correct floor. we proceed down a hallway, to come into the courtroom from the far side near the judge, but to get there we have to pass the entrance to the front of the courtroom, where my gram-gram just happens to be sitting with my brother's adorable daughter, who asks simply, in the most adorable way possible \\"why is thepewpew1337\\" in handcuffs. i enter the courtroom, am made to sit, and cue twenty minutes of everyone talking about what to do with me. they decide i should be released to my mother, so i'm taken back to juvenile hall for out-processing after signing my name on some papers, which really isn't that easy to do when your hands are cuffed to your stomach. i get my clothes and belongings back at juvie, and am made to wait at reception until my mother arrives. she arrives, waiting by her car while the receptionist talks to me. i walk out, and all she says is \\"i'm so fucking proud of you right now\\". this takes me completely off guard, because while my mom is a weirdo, and a bit of a hippy, i was sure she'd murder me for this. well, apparently she was really proud of me deciding to protest something i didn't like, i didn't ever tell her i was just looking to get laid, and we go home. it was decided i'd do 12 hours of community service, which i ended up doing. the fun part is that the principal was ready to expel me, but my mom had to go have a talk with her. there's a reason i don't mess with my mom, and this is one of several reasons why: she went in there, and the principal and vice principal were tearing into her about how i'm a terrible person and am a danger to the school, and should be expelled. my mom didn't like this, fired off some hot angry words, and somewhere along the line mentioned that a certain pocket on her purse, which she motioned to, was her gun pouch. i ended up getting 2 weeks of vacation out of school, with my grades not being affected, and no homework pile-up when i got back. me and cutie never got to screw, pretty sure she really didn't want to have anything to do with me, because while all of my in-processing and out-processing was going on, the school district was put into lockdown because apparently two kids had spread a rumor successfully through that school that i had a gun and was planning on shooting people. that part spread through the town, and made it extremely hard to get a job, because everyone now thinks i'm a domestic terrorist. the two weeks of vacation concluded, and i returned to school. turns out that the rumor ended up making me the single most feared kid at my school, because no one wanted to pick on me, hit me, or mess with me in any form after that. my grades also improved to 3.5 gpa before i graduated. turns out too that a girl who ended up becoming my girlfriend had watched the whole thing go down from down the hallway. but this isn't a love story, she was a cunt. ended up later getting a real fun job at a sporting goods warehouse in the bigger city though (got to pack guns and ammo and fun stuff like that), because being known as \\"that terrorist kid\\" makes it difficult to get a job. prior to the entire incident, i had aspirations of joining the military, probably the usmc, but having four misdemeanors on your fbi record makes that much harder, especially when one of those is assault on a police officer. (which i never did, dude just lied about me hitting him, what a dill-pickle) moral of the story: uh.....don't get arrested, and doing work to get laid is only worth it up to a point, especially when you never actually get any. sorry for this post being so long, but i wanted to convey accurately all the details. edit: (¬¥ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•\`)","output":"Summary: A student joins a protest with a girl he was attracted to at school, hoping it would lead to a romantic connection.

Progressives are complaining that their hope-and-change president has been co-opted by pro-corporate, Democratic centrism. Books could be written about the myriad ideological divides between the Tea Party and Progressives, but I‚Äôm struck at this moment by our similarities. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for these populist insurgencies to unite in the short-term to topple the political status quo that hampers each of our long-term agendas. Regardless of which party comes out on top after the mid-term elections, it will neither be as progressive nor as Tea Party-infused as either side would like -- and in terms of restoring politics to the people, both sides will still have more work to do. So what could a joint Progressive Tea Party agenda look like? 1. Ensure Clean Elections. At the very least, we all want to remove the veil of anonymity and know who‚Äôs really behind campaign donations on the left and right. But beyond that, both the Tea Party and Progressives are concerned that Washington politicians increasingly represent their moneyed campaign donors (whether big business or unions) more than their voting constituents. We can‚Äôt return politics to the people if politics is a wholly-owned subsidiary of corporate America. Imagine if both sides of the political aisle demanded that candidates only take public funding for campaigns. And ultimately we could overturn Supreme Court rulings on money and politics and mandate strict campaign finance restrictions. 2. End Bailouts and Subsidies for Big Business. The Tea Party began with opposition to the TARP bailout of big banks. For years, Progressives have opposed government subsidies of corporate agriculture and tax abatements for big businesses that alleged aim to create new jobs but end up just increasing profits. If we believe in the private market, then for-profit businesses should compete on their own without government assistance. 3. Abolish Corporate Personhood. The Tea Party wants to decrease the role of government. Progressives want to decrease the influence of giant corporations in our government and our society in general. One way to do both is to get rid of laws and practices that treat corporations as people. Otherwise, not only do behemoth corporations wield disproportionate power in America, but government resources are expended catering to and protecting the ‚Äúrights‚Äù of big business. Tea Party adherents are big critics of the notion of ‚Äúrights‚Äù in general. At least we can agree to abolish person-like rights for big business -- to make government more responsive to actual human beings. Once enacted, these three actions would dramatically curtail the corrupting influence of special interests in government and society and return power to the people. Then we can return to our respective ideological corners to fight over tax cuts versus public infrastructure or the future of gays and guns -- but at least we‚Äôd be fighting fair, with the outcomes truly determined by public will as opposed to which side's outsized corporate influence throws its weight behind which argument. I think substantively there‚Äôs even more we might agree on, like abolishing unfair ‚Äúfree‚Äù trade agreements like NAFTA that have hurt workers in the U.S. and abroad, or creating real incentives for locally-owned businesses and small scale enterprise. Given the escalated vitriol between Tea Party members and Progressives, it can be hard to recognize that, in fact, most of us share common concerns and common dreams. And amidst all the extreme rhetoric, it can be hard to acknowledge that our shared problems have shared solutions. Reforming the political process itself is a good place to start. Both the Tea Party and Progressives are fed up. For too long, the agenda in Washington has been dictated by K Street. It‚Äôs time to return politics to Main Street. Then, whatever the ideological outcome, at least it we‚Äôd have a political system about which, whether left or right, we could all be proud.

The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot. Why was the Greater London Council established? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The Greater London Council (GLC) was established primarily to address the rapid growth of the urban area and better manage the diverse needs of the sprawling metropolis. Prior to the establishment of the GLC in 1965, London's political boundaries did not accurately represent the extent of its urban growth which had occurred during the post-World War II era. This presented significant challenges in terms of administration, planning, and the provision of public services and infrastructure. The GLC was created as an overarching authority, combining the administrative powers of the earlier London County Council and the surrounding counties of Essex, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, and Hertfordshire. This larger governing body allowed for a more cohesive approach to the management of London's growth, as well as enabling the coordination of regional planning, transportation, housing, and environmental policies, among others. The GLC was responsible for various aspects of governance, such as public transport and the management of major roads, policing, fire services, waste disposal, and flood prevention. It also played an important role in the promotion of arts and culture. Through better-equipped governance, the council was designed to streamline decision-making and begin to address issues arising from the city's drastic expansion. In summary, the establishment of the Greater London Council aimed to accurately account for the city's growing urban area and to facilitate a more efficient and effective system of governance in response to the increasing complexities of managing London's expanding population and infrastructure needs."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Task: Write a sentence not in English.

They have gone through many line-up changes, leaving bassist D. D. Verni and lead vocalist Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth as the only constant members. In addition to Verni and Ellsworth, Overkill's current lineup includes Dave Linsk on lead guitar, Derek Tailer on rhythm guitar and Jason Bittner on drums. After taking a break, Overkill resurfaced in 2002 with Wrecking Everything, their second full-length live album, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The album contained only songs that had not been on Wrecking Your Neck, some simply because they were released on later albums, but also a few early songs from albums such as Taking Over and Under the Influence. The same show was used for Overkill's first ever DVD, Wrecking Everything - An Evening in Asbury Park, also released in 2002. The European tour in June 2002, supporting both Bloodletting and Wrecking Everything saw Blaze and Wicked Mystic opening up for Overkill. During the second to last show of the tour in Nuremberg, Germany, Blitz suffered a stroke on stage and collapsed. For nearly three days, rumors ran rampant, reporting everything from Blitz being in a coma, permanently paralyzed, or even that Blitz had died. Finally, three days later, the band announced that the stroke was very minor and had no lasting consequences, as well as no cause that could be determined by the doctors. Overkill signed to Spitfire Records and entered the studio in late 2002 to record their next studio album, Killbox 13. Produced by the band and Colin Richardson and released in March 2003, the album was actually only their twelfth regular studio album, but the Overkill EP was also counted to achieve the number 13. The album received critical acclaim, combining the \\"new\\" Overkill with their raw early style as presented on the debut album Feel the Fire. Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with Seven Witches and After All. The band played without Derek Tailer, who was absent for undisclosed reasons. Nobody was hired to fill in for him, so Overkill toured as a four-piece for the first time since 1990. Tailer was still considered a full member of the band. In late 2004, after a Japanese tour with Death Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam, the band started work on another record in D. D. Verni's own recording studio. The album, ReliXIV, was produced and mixed by the band themselves and released in March 2005. Overkill toured the eastern US in April 2005, and just before they went on a European tour in May, it was announced that Tim Mallare would not take part in this tour. Replacing him for the tour was former Hades drummer Ron Lipnicki. A few weeks later, the band announced that Mallare had left permanently and Lipnicki was his replacement.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County.

To do this, we will subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: 2*k + 22 - 22 = 0 - 22 This simplifies to: 2*k = -22 Step 3: Solve for 'k' Now that we have isolated the variable 'k', we will solve for it. Since 2*k equals -22, we just need to divide -22 by 2. k = (-22) / 2 Dividing -22 by 2 gives us: k = -11 So, the solution to the equation 2*k + 171 - 149 = 0 is k = -11."},{"instruction":"Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

Sentence A: \\"He rakes leaves in his backyard in the autumn.\\" This sentence makes sense because leaves typically fall from trees during the autumn season. It is a common activity to rake leaves during this time, so the statement is reasonable and understandable. Sentence B: \\"He rakes leaves in his backyard in the spring.\\" While it might seem unusual to rake leaves in the spring, there are instances where this can make sense. Springtime is generally associated with blooming plants and newly grown leaves, but there can be instances where leaves have gathered in someone's backyard during the winter or from adjacent areas. In these cases, it is reasonable to think someone might rake leaves in the spring.

The Nobel committee cited Professor Deaton‚Äôs work around 1980 in modeling demand for individual goods, which was both some of the earliest work in that vein and a model that remains in wide use. In continuing his research, he found that rising incomes tend to improve calorie intake for the poorest families, but the effect diminishes at higher income levels. Aggregate statistics, as a result, obscured the benefits of income gains for very poor families. ‚ÄúWhat he‚Äôs shown is that you do learn a great deal more by looking at the behavior that underlies the aggregates,‚Äù said Duncan Thomas, an economist at Duke University and another former student.

Angus Deaton, 69, became the 47th recipient of the Nobel, which was announced by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. BREAKING NEWS The 2015 Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to 69 years old Angus Deaton @Princeton #NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/8iHMo0CcPX He received the accolade for three decades of research analysing welfare in the developing world and the relationship between income and spending. \\"Mr Deaton's work has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics & development economics\\" said the Royal Swedish Academy. The decision to award the prize to an economist whose work has influenced public policy on aid and poverty, was widely praised. US economist Tyler Cowen said Mr Deaton was \\"a brilliant, excellent selection\\". He described him as an \\"economist who looks more closely at what poor households consume to get a better sense of their living standards and possible paths for economic development. \\"He truly, deeply understands the implications of economic growth, the benefits of modernity, and political economy\\" said Mr Cowen. Mr Deaton, who holds both US and British citizenship, taught at the Universities of Cambridge and Bristol, before moving to the US. He said he was \\"surprised and delighted\\" albeit a little \\"sleepy\\" when he received the call from Stockholm at his US home on Monday morning. Aid is guided less by the needs of the recipients than by the donor country‚Äôs domestic and international interests. Angus Deaton Born in Edinburgh in 1945, Angus Deaton is the son of a Yorkshire miner who later became a civil engineer. Mr Deaton fulfilled his father's dream by gaining a scholarship to study at the prestigious Fettes College in Edinburgh aged 13. \\"My father believed in education, and he liked to measure things\\" wrote Mr Deaton in 2011. \\"He was determined that I should be educated properly, and set his heart on sending me to Fettes College... whose annual fees were well in excess of his salary\\". While at Cambridge, Mr Deaton said he \\"found economics much more to my taste than mathematics\\". He left Cambridge to briefly work for the Bank of England, but soon returned for his post-graduate study, later receiving his PhD in economics. \\"He was in a bit of shock...but I think he was very very happy\\" said prize giver and friend, professor Jakob Svensson. Mr Deaton's most recent book, \\"The Great Escape\\" was published in 2013. In it he argues that foreign aid from western governments has done more harm than good to developing nations, saying that it has helped prop up corrupt governments and rarely reaches the poor. \\"The idea that global poverty could be eliminated if only rich people or rich countries were to give more money to poor people or to poor countries, however appealing, is wrong\\", he wrote in 2013. \\"These simplistic beliefs are based on a misdiagnosis of what it is that is keeping people poor\\". The Deaton choice will not make the aid industry happy. He is a vocal critic of foreign aid. ‚Äî Dani Rodrik (@rodrikdani) October 12, 2015 Economist Justin Wolfers described him as \\"one of the great microeconomists and microeconometricians of our time.\\" \\"Deaton has worked tirelessly to understand the lot of the poor\\". Angus Deaton has been one of the pioneering researchers on the economics of happiness & well-being. ‚Äî Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) October 12, 2015 Last year, the award - which is officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in memory of Alfred Nobel - went to French economist Jean Tirole for his pioneering work on the regulation of large companies.

Other candidates had included British economist and professor at University College London, Sir Robert Blundell. What did Angus Deaton win the Nobel prize for? Angus Deaton is one of the world's foremost economists specialising in the nature of poverty and living standards in the developing world. His contribution to economic science hinges on pioneering ways to measure poverty at the individual rather than societal level. Mr Deaton's research, mainly in India, has focussed on using household survey data to show relationships between income and consumption, concentrating on aspects such as calorie intake and food demand when incomes rise and fall. His findings have also given birth to the \\"Deaton Paradox\\" - the observation that short sudden shocks to people's income do not have large effects on consumption. In 1980, Mr Deaton developed a model called the \\"Almost Ideal Demand System\\", an intuitive way of estimating how the demand for each good depends on the prices of all goods and on individual incomes ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","output":"Scottish economist Angus Deaton has been awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in economics for his innovative work on measuring poverty around the world.

To keep our superhero strong, we need to clean its special parts called \\"coils.\\" We have two types of coils, one is called \\"condenser coils\\" and the other is called \\"evaporator coils.\\" Now, let's say you want to clean the condenser coils. You'll need an adult helper to do this, okay? They'll turn off the air conditioner first, then they'll carefully remove the big outside cover. Then, they'll gently brush off the dirt on the coils with a soft brush, and finally, they'll spray the coils with a special cleaner, let it work its magic, and rinse it off with water. Ta-da! Our superhero's condenser coils are clean! For the evaporator coils, the steps are a bit different but still need an adult helper. They'll go inside the house, turn off the air conditioner, and find the small panel where the evaporator coils are hiding. They'll carefully take away the panel, and then they'll use a special no-rinse cleaner to spray the coils and let the cleaner foam away the dirt. All done! The evaporator coils are sparkly clean too! Now, about your question, if these two questions are the same - nope, they're not. The first one talks about cleaning the condenser coils found outside while the second one talks about cleaning the evaporator coils inside our superhero's secret hideout.

I think that the Timbre of the Theremin used for this album is poor. Possibly modern Theremins are better in this regard. I feel as though I have thrown good money away.As an analogy, I think that this may be likened to Kenny G playing the slide whistle instead of a soprano sax! Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the review - The review is about an album featuring a Theremin, a specific musical instrument. The reviewer is unhappy with the quality of the Theremin used in the album. Step 2: Assess the overall sentiment - The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the album, stating that the Theremin used has a poor timbre and makes for an irritating listening experience. The money spent feels wasted. Step 3: Evaluate the reviewer's analogy - The analogy mentioned compares the situation to a different artist playing an instrument (Kenny G playing the slide whistle instead of a soprano sax). The analogy suggests that the reviewer thinks the issue isn't necessarily with the instrument itself, but more with the quality and execution of the instrument used in this specific product. Step 4: Consider reviewer's opinion on modern Theremins - The reviewer also mentions that modern Theremins might be better, implying that the issue may be specific to this product rather than a general issue with all Theremins. Step 5: Make a decision on the impact - Overall, this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product, comparison to an inferior musical scenario, and the specific criticism of the Theremin in this album all contribute to my decision to avoid this product."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time - The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves.

Options: - arguments - dust poisoning - headache - exhaustion - boredom Reasoning process:","output":"1. First, let's consider the context of the situation: you are doing housework and there is a lot of dust involved. We can assume this means you are performing tasks like sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting surfaces. 2. Now, let's analyze each of the given options: - Arguments: This option doesn't seem related to the presence of dust during housework. Arguments could occur in any situation and are not specific to a dusty environment. - Dust poisoning: While inhaling a lot of dust could potentially cause respiratory issues, \\"dust poisoning\\" is not a known medical condition. Besides, most regular housework wouldn't expose someone to a sufficient amount of toxic substances to cause poisoning. - Headache: Inhaling dust particles can potentially trigger respiratory or sinus issues, which might cause a headache. This is a plausible option. - Exhaustion: Doing housework can be physically tiring, but exhaustion is not directly caused by the presence of dust. Instead, it is a result of the physical effort involved in cleaning. - Boredom: Boredom is a subjective feeling that depends on the individual's preferences and interests. While it's possible that someone might find housework boring, this feeling does not directly result from the presence of dust. 3. Conclusion: Among the given options, the one that is most directly related to the presence of dust during housework is \\"headache.\\" Inhaling dust particles can cause respiratory or sinus issues which may lead to a headache. Other options may happen in the context of housekeeping, but they are not related to dust specifically."},{"instruction":"What is the most least living expense to stay in Toronto for an international student? The difference between sociology and psychology? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: i. no ii. yes","output":"To calculate the least living expense for an international student in Toronto, we need to consider several factors, such as housing, transportation, food, utilities, and other miscellaneous expenses. Here's a breakdown of the costs: 1. Housing: Rental prices depend on the area and type of accommodation. On average, university residence or dormitory can cost around CAD 1,000 - CAD 1,500 per month. If you choose to live off-campus, a shared apartment could range from CAD 800 to CAD 1,200 per month. 2. Utilities: Utility costs depend on your housing choice. If you are living in a university dormitory, utilities are often included in the rent. For off-campus accommodations, utilities can vary from CAD 100 to CAD 200 per month. 3. Transportation: A monthly public transportation pass for students in Toronto costs around CAD 122. If you're traveling pre-dominantly within walking distance, you can minimize your transportation expenses. 4. Food: Cooking meals at home is the most cost-effective choice. On average, grocery expenses can range from CAD 200 to CAD 400 per month. Eating out occasionally or in the university cafeteria can bring your food costs to around CAD 400 to CAD 600 per month, depending on your food choices and frequency of eating out. 5. Miscellaneous Expenses: These include expenses such as entertainment, personal care items, clothing, and more. Depending on your needs, these can range from CAD 100 to CAD 300 per month. To be on the lower end of the expenses, an international student might need a minimum budget of CAD 1,300 to CAD 1,700 per month to cover all living expenses in Toronto. Now let's address the second part of the question about the difference between sociology and psychology: Sociology and psychology are two distinct fields of study that explore human behavior and society, but with different perspectives and methodologies. Sociology is the scientific study of society and human interaction within social groups. It focuses on analyzing the structures, cultures, and institutions of societies to understand how they influence individual and collective behavior. Sociologists observe patterns, norms, social inequalities, and interactions to identify how various social factors contribute to human behavior, including race, class, gender, age, and religion. Some primary research areas in sociology include families, organizations, crime, urbanization, social inequality, social change, and social movements. On the other hand, psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and its functions, particularly those affecting behavior in a given context. Psychologists are interested in understanding mental processes, emotions, motivations, and personality traits that drive individual actions. The focus of psychology lies predominantly at the individual level, but it also touches upon interpersonal and group dynamics. Major fields in psychology include cognitive, developmental, clinical, neuropsychology, social, industrial-organizational, and forensic psychology, among others. In summary, sociology primarily examines social structures and group dynamics, while psychology focuses on individual mental processes and behaviors. Regarding the multi-choice problem, it seems that the question is asking whether two distinct questions are the same. Since these questions - the living expense calculation for Toronto and the difference between sociology and psychology - are not the same, the answer to the multi-choice problem would be: i. no"},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: take it when you want to yeah Sentence 2: There is a set time you must take it.

Although the second sentence lacks the information about Donna Summer's death, it is too low. 4). 3: This answer would mean that the sentences are somewhat similar, with some noticeable differences. This is an acceptable rating, given that both sentences share the same subject and descriptor but differ in the information provided. 5). 4: This answer would mean that the sentences are very similar, with only minor differences. Since the two sentences share a subject and descriptor, this rating is the most appropriate. 6). 5: This answer would mean that the sentences mean the same thing. This rating is not applicable, as the first sentence conveys Donna Summer's death, which is absent from the second sentence. Based on this analysis, the level of similarity between the two sentences can be rated as a 4. This means that the two sentences are very similar but have some minor differences, mainly due to the information provided in the first sentence about Donna Summer's death."},{"instruction":"Skylar had 5 years of experience horseback riding and often spoke their opinion freely. Given the context: Why did Skylar do this?","output":"In the given context, Skylar's actions stem from two main factors: their experience and their personality traits. 1. Experience: With 5 years of horseback riding experience, Skylar has likely developed a solid foundation in riding techniques, horse care, equipment, and various other aspects related to this activity. This experience could have given them the confidence and knowledge to discuss and share their perspectives on horse-related topics. Experienced individuals are more likely to contribute information and advice to others as they feel that their time spent developing their skills has given them valuable insights. 2. Personality Traits: Another reason for Skylar speaking their opinion freely could be related to their innate personality traits. Some individuals are more comfortable expressing their thoughts and ideas openly and assertively. This could be due to a high level of confidence in their abilities, a strong sense of self, or just a naturally outgoing and communicative disposition. In Skylar's case, it seems that their personality allows them to share their views without hesitation, regardless of the subject matter. In summary, Skylar's willingness to express their opinions on horseback riding can be attributed to their 5 years of experience, which has given them valuable knowledge to share with others, and their personality traits that make them open and confident in sharing their perspective."},{"instruction":"Q:Background: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person observed autumn cooling? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 ¬∞C (0.09 ¬∞F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 ¬∞C (0.2 ¬∞F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

It is composed of Gary LeVox, his second cousin Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney. DeMarcus is also a brother-in-law of country music singer James Otto, and formerly one-half of the Christian music duo East to West. They are best known for performing a cover of Tom Cochrane's \\"Life Is a Highway\\". In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\", a song that had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed. The song, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard country charts, was the first single from their self-titled debut, which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street. Following \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\", the album's other three singles all made top ten on that chart: \\"This Everyday Love\\", \\"While You Loved Me\\", and \\"I'm Movin' On\\", which respectively peaked at No. 9, 7, and 4. \\"I'm Movin' On\\" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the album with favor, calling it \\"a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album\\". Melt was the title of their second album, released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced Melt. Its first single, \\"These Days\\", also became their first No. 1 single on the country chart. The album included two more top ten hits, \\"Love You Out Loud\\" and \\"I Melt\\", and the band's second number-one single, \\"Mayberry\\". The music video for \\"I Melt\\" featured partial nudity and was banned from the Great American Country network. Rascal Flatts's third album was entitled Feels Like Today, released in late 2004. The album's title track was its first single, followed by \\"Bless the Broken Road\\". The latter song was originally recorded by its co-writer, Marcus Hummon, and had also been recorded by Melodie Crittenden (whose version made the country chart in 1998), Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Sons of the Desert. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts's version of the song spent five weeks at No. 1, followed by \\"Fast Cars and Freedom\\", which also hit No. 1. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a hidden track on the album, titled \\"Skin\\".

This trading center was set up by the Danish East India Company, also known as \\"√òstindisk Kompagni\\" in Danish. The Danish East India Company was a Denmark-born trading company operating in India and similar Southeast Asian regions from 1616 to 1669. It was modeled after the successful Dutch East India Company, a chartered company of Dutch merchants. The primary objective was to carry out trade operations for the economic benefit of Denmark. The first trading center was established in 1620, in the coastal town of Tranquebar, also known as Tharangambadi, which is situated in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India. This was made possible after a treaty was signed between the kingdom of Denmark and the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, giving them the right to establish a fort and trading post in Tharangambadi. The trading center was known as Fort Dansborg, which became the seat of the Danish trade in South India. The Danish East India Company, under the leadership of Admiral Ove Gjedde, took a fleet to India. Despite having an initial trading relationship that seemed promising, the company failed to make the meaningful impact on trade they had hoped for. By the mid-17th century, the Danish East India Company, which was inadequately funded and lacked the necessary naval power as well, was unable to effectively compete in the area. The company was eventually liquidated. However, the Danish presence in Tranquebar continued long after the dissolution of the Danish East India Company. It lasted for about 225 years, from 1620 to 1845, before its territories were sold to the British East India Company in 1845. Fort Dansborg, which served as the trading center, has been preserved and is now utilized as a museum showcasing the Danish influence on the region and its history. Its establishment marks an important chapter in the cultural and trade history of Denmark and its involvement in the colonial era of South Asia."},{"instruction":"Question 1: Electric Appliances: What happens when you insert a DC voltmeter to a 60Hz AC power supply? Question 2: How do I convert 3 V DC power supply to 220 V AC? Available choices: A). no B). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, let's first provide a brief overview of each and then determine whether the answers would be the same. Question 1: Electric Appliances: What happens when you insert a DC voltmeter to a 60Hz AC power supply? A DC voltmeter is designed to measure direct current (DC) voltage, while AC power supplies provide alternating current (AC) voltage. If you connect a DC voltmeter to a 60Hz AC power supply, the meter will likely produce inaccurate or unstable readings because it's not designed to measure AC voltage. In some cases, depending on the arrangement and the characteristics of the voltmeter, it might show an average value close to zero as the AC voltage waveform oscillates symmetrically around zero volts (positive to negative). Answer for Question 1: Connecting a DC voltmeter to a 60Hz AC power supply would result in inaccurate or unstable readings. Question 2: How do I convert 3 V DC power supply to 220 V AC? To convert a 3 V DC power supply to a 220 V AC output, you will need an appropriate DC-to-AC converter or inverter. The converter should be designed to accept a low voltage DC input (3 V) and produce a higher voltage AC output (220 V). The device will first boost the 3V DC input using a step-up transformer or similar method to reach the desired voltage level, then an oscillator circuit will be used to convert the DC voltage into alternating current waveform. Answer for Question 2: To convert a 3 V DC power supply to a 220 V AC, you will need an appropriate DC-to-AC converter or inverter. Now, let's examine the available choices: A). no B). yes The question asks whether the answers to both questions are the same. Since Question 1 discusses the consequences of connecting a DC voltmeter to an AC power supply and Question 2 deals with converting a 3 V DC power supply to a 220 V AC output, the answers are different. Thus, the correct choice would be: Answer: A). no"},{"instruction":"What would be the ‚òÖ-rating of this review (‚òÖ being the lowest and ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ being the highest)? \\"Works perfectly and stability on my Motorola G 3rd gen running marshmallow.

On the third play of the game, Brady attempted a deep pass to Moss; it was intercepted by rookie cornerback Vontae Davis at the Dolphins' 7-yard line and returned 15 yards. Six plays later, the Dolphins moved into Patriots territory on a 21-yard catch by tight end Joey Haynos from Chad Henne; after the catch, McGowan forced Haynos to fumble, but the ball went out of bounds at the spot of the catch, the Patriots' 39-yard line. On the next play, Henne appeared to have been strip-sacked by Banta-Cain, with linebacker Adalius Thomas returning it 59 yards for a touchdown. However, the Dolphins challenged that Henne's arm was moving forward and it was an incomplete pass and the play was reversed. Three plays later, a Dan Carpenter 52-yard field goal gave the Dolphins a 3-0 lead. The Patriots began their next drive at their own 37-yard line after offensive lineman Dan Connolly returned a short kickoff 16 yards. A few plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 36-yard pass to the Dolphins' 1-yard line; Maroney then ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-3 lead. On the ensuing possession, Henne found his other tight end, Anthony Fasano on a 20-yard strike to move into Patriots territory, but a \\"Wildcat\\" formation run by Ricky Williams for a loss and a sack by Chung moved the Dolphins out of field goal territory and forced a punt. The Patriots advanced to the Dolphins' 42-yard line on their next drive before punting on the final play of the first quarter. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots began an 11-play, 49-yard drive that reached the Dolphins' 11-yard line on first down before a short pass, and incompletion, and sack led to a Gostkowski field goal; the 30-yarder put the Patriots ahead 10-3. The Dolphins introduced rookie quarterback Pat White on their next drive, employing him as part of an option offense that first had White run for a 33-yard gain and later in the drive had White option to Williams for a 15-yard touchdown run, tying the game. Following a 34-yard punt return by Tate, the Patriots quickly moved back into Dolphins territory on completions of 14 yards to Faulk and 23 yards to Watson. However, a Watson pass interference penalty on a 17-yard Faulk reception pushed the Patriots back to the Dolphins' 35-yard line. Gostkowski would later kick a 38-yard field goal to re-establish a Patriots lead at 13-10. On their next drive, the Dolphins would punt shortly after the two-minute warning, setting up a 10-play, 70-yard Patriots drive that ended the half with a 34-yard Gostkowski field goal after Brady was again sacked in the red zone. With possession and down 16-10 at the start of the third quarter, the Dolphins moved downfield on a 16-play drive that lasted more than ten minutes, eventually scoring on a 1-yard touchdown catch by Haynos from running back Ronnie Brown out of the \\"Wildcat,\\" giving the Dolphins a 17-16 lead. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected on a 71-yard touchdown pass and then again on the two-point conversion to re-take the lead at 24-17. The Dolphins would continue to employ both White and the \\"Wildcat\\" on their next drive, but it resulted in a Brandon Fields punt early in the fourth quarter. An exchange of punts consumed the next six minutes of the game, with the Dolphins choosing to use all three of their timeouts to gain back possession with 3:38 left. However, three straight incompletions and a penalty set up fourth down, when Henne again was unable to complete a pass from his own 27-yard line. The Patriots re-gained possession and ran the ball three times before Gostkowski kicked a 40-yard field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-17. The game would end four plays later on a 23-yard Greg Camarillo reception to the Patriots' 23-yard line. The win bettered the Patriots record to 6-2 entering their matchup with the 8-0 Colts.

It's highly effective at calming your body when it's in an anxious state. Practice tactical breathing a little every day, even when you are calm, so that you will already know how to do it when you are nervous. Breathe in through your nose for a slow 4-count. Hold your breath for a slow 4-count. Breathe out through your mouth for a slow 4-count. Hold your breath for a slow 4-count. Repeat this process four times. Many people find that their hands do not shake if they clench a different muscle. Try clenching your buttocks or your thigh muscles. Your audience won't be able to tell, and it just might stop your shaky hands or any other shaky body part. You may have noticed yourself pressing on your temples or rubbing your hands when you're stressed. You do this because it stimulates nearby bundles of nerves and releases cortisol, which can help calm your nervous system. To subtly release some relaxation onstage, press some fingers into the fleshy part of your hand between your fingers and thumb. You can do this behind your back, or behind a podium while you speak. If you shake from anxiety, a therapist may be able to help you find ways to lessen your symptoms. If your shaking is changing and becoming worse, let your doctor know. Your doctor may also refer you to a therapist who can help you come up with a long-term plan for dealing with your anxiety. While anxiety can cause tremors, it's also possible that another condition is contributing to your shaking. Your doctor can help you investigate the possibility of an underlying condition.

To recap the whole process and better understand the final step, let's break down the entire process of photosynthesis, which takes place in the following steps: 1. Sunlight shines on plants: Photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll pigments within the chloroplasts of plant cells. Sunlight is the primary source of energy for this process. 2. Cells with chlorophyll capture the light energy: Chlorophyll pigments trap the light energy and convert it into chemical energy within the plants' cells. 3. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stomata: Stomata are tiny openings on the surface of plant leaves that facilitate gas exchange. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the surrounding atmosphere through these stomatal pores. 4. Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts: Water is taken up by the roots and transported through the vascular tissues, called xylem, to the different parts of the plant to maintain overall plant hydration and support various cellular processes. 5. Plants absorb minerals through their roots: Along with water, minerals and nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are absorbed by plants through their roots from the soil. These nutrients are vital for various physiological processes within plants, including photosynthesis. 6. Plants convert these inputs into sugars: Once all the required inputs are absorbed by the plant, the process of photosynthesis commences. The chemical energy captured by chlorophyll, along with water, carbon dioxide, and minerals, is used to produce glucose (sugar) molecules through a series of complex chemical reactions. The glucose molecules serve as a primary energy source for plants, allowing them to grow, develop, and reproduce. 7. Sugars can be used as energy sources: The glucose produced through photosynthesis is either utilized immediately to fuel various metabolic processes within the plant or converted into complex carbohydrates (such as starch and cellulose) and stored for later use. 8. Oxygen and water are produced: As the final step of the process, oxygen and water are released as by-products of photosynthesis. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released through the same stomata used to absorb carbon dioxide, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem by providing a vital oxygen source for a plethora of life forms, including humans and other animals. Thus, the final step involves the release of oxygen and water as by-products of the photosynthesis process, which not only completes the process but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance on our planet."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Non-smokers can stay in rooms with windows facing the atrium ‚Äì a beautiful winter garden.\\" to Russian?","output":"–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, –º–∞–ª—ã—à! –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, —è —Ö–æ—á—É –ø–æ–º–æ—á—å. –í–æ—Ç –Ω–∞—à–∞ —Ñ—Ä–∞–∑–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ: \\"–ù–µ–∫—É—Ä—è—â–∏–µ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –≤ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∞—Ö —Å –æ–∫–Ω–∞–º–∏, –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–∏–º–∏ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç—Ä–∏—É–º - –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π –∑–∏–º–Ω–∏–π —Å–∞–¥.\\" –≠—Ç–æ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –ª—é–¥–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –Ω–µ –∫—É—Ä—è—Ç, –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –∂–∏—Ç—å –≤ –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–∞—Ö —Å –≤–∏–¥–æ–º –Ω–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π —Å–∞–¥, –≥–¥–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç—É—Ç —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∞–∂–µ –∑–∏–º–æ–π."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Very good app Am using this app for rounds in temple\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect [Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. What two architectural movements have come under criticism for their focus on individuality?","output":"Modernism and Postmodernism are the two architectural movements that have come under criticism for their focus on individuality. Critics argue that these movements prioritize personal, philosophical, and aesthetic pursuits by individual architects over the practical and functional needs of the people who eventually use the spaces. Modernism, which emerged in the early 20th century, sought to break away from traditional architectural styles and embraced new materials, technologies, and designs that emphasized simplicity, functionality, and minimalism. Some critics, however, feel that this approach tended to sideline the socio-cultural context and human aspects, resulting in cold and impersonal buildings. Postmodernism, which developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a reaction to Modernism, reintroduced ornamentation, historical references, and a more playful approach to architecture. While this movement aimed to address some of the shortcomings of Modernism, it has also been criticized for focusing too much on the architect's individual artistic expression and often prioritizing form over function. Many architects and critics advocate for a more balanced approach, where the design process is informed by interdisciplinary knowledge including behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. This would help to ensure that architectural projects better consider the everyday needs of people, create livable environments, and contribute positively to the surrounding context."},{"instruction":"Richard John Santorum (born May 10, 1958) is an American attorney, author, politician, and CNN Senior Political Commentator.

You can either shred them or grate them, but it's a whole lot easier to shred those cheeses too\\". Shredding cheese may seem a bit cumbersome, but it enhances the flavor and melty texture of the dish. When cheese is pre-shredded, it often contains additives to keep the shreds from clumping together in the bag. These can negatively affect the way the cheese melts, making it more difficult to achieve that desired creamy consistency in your macaroni and cheese. Furthermore, different types of cheeses create diverse and richer flavors when combined. In this case, cheddar brings a sharp flavor, while parmesan adds a salty, savory taste. Combined, these create a rich, complex flavor profile that makes your mac n' cheese taste gourmet. Cubing the Velveeta, a type of processed cheese, is also a good idea as processed cheese has emulsifiers that allow for a smoother melt. Cutting it into smaller cubes increases the surface area that comes into contact with the heat, letting it melt faster and more evenly within the dish. Regarding the bacon, it's a wonderful addition if you're looking to bring a bit of smoky flavor and crispy texture to your macaroni and cheese. Bacon should be precooked before adding it to the dish. You can bake or pan-fry the bacon to your preferred level of crispiness, then crumble or chop it into bite-sized pieces. Remember though, making creamy mac n' cheese is more than just combining cooked pasta and cheese. You need to create a smooth cheese sauce that will coat your macaroni, allowing every nook and cranny to be filled with cheesy goodness. This involves melting your cheeses into a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk ‚Äì known as a b√©chamel. Once everything is prepared ‚Äì your cheese is shredded, your bacon is cooked, and your pasta is boiled ‚Äì it's just a matter of combining it all together and then baking it to golden perfection.

Q: By Orla GuerinBBC News, Tripoli The heady days of the revolution of 2011 - which unseated long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi - are long gone. In the ensuing years there has been a Libyan rendition of the TV series Game of Thrones, all about violent power struggles, involving competing militias, rival governments and, increasingly, foreign players. In the capital these days the distant thud of battle punctuates the rumble of the traffic, but the streets are busy. This is a city fuelled by oil, coffee and resilience. The latest round of battle began in April when a renegade commander, General Khalifa Haftar, led forces from his power base in eastern Libya to make an assault on Tripoli in the west. He heads the self-styled Libyan National Army, and already controls most of the country. But six months on, Tripoli still eludes the moustachioed military strongman, who is backed by the Tobruk-based government. He is stuck on the southern outskirts of the city. 'Casually tossing a grenade' Gen Haftar has been held off by an array of militias - which often fight each other - now fighting under the banner of Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA). It is backed by the UN, but its writ barely runs inside Tripoli, much less outside it. It is struggling to keep the lights on and the water running, even in the capital. During a recent visit to Libya we travelled by pick-up truck through battle-scarred suburbs to reach the lines of the frontline. There had been little movement since our last trip in April. At moments it felt like 2011 once again, with young volunteers in flip-flops risking death from the enemy - and themselves. One fighter casually tossed his rocket-propelled grenade into the front seat of a truck - after he had tried and failed to fire it. Yearning for peace The commander, Salem Bin Ismail, a slight, softly-spoken figure in a camouflage T-shirt, pointed down a deserted road to Gen Haftar's forces, just 500m (1,650ft) away. For this veteran of the Nato-backed uprising against Gaddafi, the current conflict is about preventing a return to authoritarian rule in Libya. \\"We have had chaos since 2011. I hope this is the last of the wars. We fought against Gaddafi to get rid of military control. Circumstances led us to fight again,\\" he said. \\"We want ballot boxes and elections and civilian rule. We believe in democracy,\\" he added. Gen Haftar: A man of many wars Profile: Khalifa Haftar For many who defend Tripoli it is more a case of opposing Gen Haftar than backing the GNA - and there are plenty in the capital who support neither. But Gen Haftar has powerful friends abroad, including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Russia. Increasingly the battle for Tripoli is another proxy war in the Middle East. Parallels with Syria \\"This conflict is largely sustained by the foreign powers backing Haftar,\\" said Emad Badi, a Libyan non-resident scholar at the US-based Middle East Institute. \\"People give Haftar too much credit. He has become a conduit for foreign powers. I think that the decisions are beyond him,\\" he added. The GNA too has foreign supporters - Turkey and Qatar - but the big guns are on the other side. \\"Numerically the number of states that are supportive or leaning towards Haftar are a lot more, and have a lot more political capital than Turkey and Qatar,\\" said Mr Badi. He believes that even if Gen Haftar manages to enter Tripoli he will not be able to get control of the city, and the battle may drag on, like other long-running wars in the region. \\"If you look at Syria and Yemen, some of the same powers are involved,\\" said Mr Badi. 'Burying young people daily' As foreign players stoke the conflict, Tripoli counts the cost. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that since April, at least 1,000 people have been killed, including around 100 civilians, and 120,000 displaced. \\"Every day we are burying young people who should be helping us build Libya,\\" said Fathi Bashagha, the GNA's interior minister. He accused the international community, including the UK, of failing to support the country since 2011. \\"They did not complete the project. They wanted to remove Muammar Gaddafi but they should have supported us to rebuild a country, and to rebuild the army. Instead they left us.\\" The minister said that with the government focused on the defence of Tripoli, the militant Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda can take advantage of the vacuum. \\"They will use this chance. They can grow now in the desert, and they can move, and nobody can stop them,\\" said Mr Bashagha. And he warned of another danger - that Libya will descend into all-out civil war if the conflict continues. 'Existential threat' There have been warnings too from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said recently that Libya is starting to resemble Syria. She is pushing for an international peace conference before the end of the year. \\"It's imperative we do everything we can to make sure this does not escalate into a proxy war,\\" she said. Reports of Russian mercenaries, Egyptian military advisers, and Emirati drones in Libya all indicate it may be too late for that. You may also be interested in: The former UK ambassador to Libya, Peter Millett, expects the German conference to take place, but says progress on the ground is probably a long way off. \\"Haftar can't and won't win, but Egypt and the Emiratis can't afford to lose. The Egyptians want to control their Western neighbour, and they don't want terrorism on their border. For them it's existential,\\" he said. \\"For the Emiratis it's more about ideology. They think they can play a big role in Libya as they have in Yemen,\\" he added. In the end though, Mr Millett believes the current stalemate will result in a \\"raggedy ceasefire\\", and exhaustion will lead to back-channel negotiations and some sort of political deal. \\"There will have to be a carve up, and a sharing of oil resources. It will have to be clear that the people and the tribes of eastern Libya will benefit from the money.\\" He is encouraged by the fact that the UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salam√© - a seasoned negotiator - has remained in his post. \\"If anyone can pull a rabbit out of a hat he can, said Mr Millett, \\"but it won't be a good-looking rabbit\\".

In recent years, the widespread use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat has vastly increased global connectivity and communication. As digital technology continues to evolve, social media has become an integral part of modern society, shaping the way people interact with each other. The use of social media is especially prevalent among teenagers and young adults, who are highly drawn towards these platforms due to their convenience and accessibility. However, concerns have emerged regarding the potential impact of social media use on the mental health of teenagers. Hypothesis: Increased social media usage directly correlates to the worsening of mental health among teenagers. The proposed hypothesis suggests that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time teenagers spend on social media and the decline in their mental health. This theory posits that the more time teenagers dedicate to these platforms, the more likely they are to suffer from mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Several factors contribute to this hypothesis, including: 1. Social Comparison: Social media platforms allow for a constant stream of comparison between users. Teenagers who spend large amounts of time on social media can become increasingly susceptible to comparing themselves to their peers, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their own lives. 2. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The often-curated highlights of other users' lives on social media can create an illusion that others are constantly enjoying exciting events and experiences, leading teenagers to develop a fear of missing out (FOMO). This fear can contribute to increased feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction with their own lives. 3. Cyberbullying: Social media makes it easier for individuals to harass and bully others, and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to cyberbullying. The mental health consequences of being a victim of cyberbullying can result in depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. 4. Sleep Deprivation: Spending excessive time on social media, particularly at night, can lead to sleep deprivation in teenagers. Lack of sleep has been associated with a higher risk of developing mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. 5. Addiction: Social media platforms are deliberately designed to be addictive in order to maximize user engagement. Dependency on social media may lead to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and isolation for some users, particularly teenagers. To test this hypothesis, researchers could design a longitudinal study that monitors teenagers' social media usage, mental health indicators, and other relevant factors over time. This would help establish whether there is a causal relationship between increased social media use and the worsening of mental health among teenagers, as well as provide valuable insights into the potential long-term impacts of social media on adolescent development and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"LONDON - Entertaining football in the Premiership, boring in the Champions League.

The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sick√¢¬Ä¬îwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to her√¢¬Ä¬îJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

Step 2: Highlight the main themes - The main themes in the movie plot are love, self-discovery, secrecy, and confronting societal expectations. Step 3: Create a title that reflects these elements - I chose \\"Hidden Desires in the City\\" because it captures the secretive nature of Jessica and Helen's relationship, their personal desires for something different in love, and the setting of the story taking place in New York City.

As the Earth's lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates, these plates move due to the convection currents in the underlying hot and semi-fluid asthenosphere. This internal pressure and movement cause the plates to collide, pull apart or slide past each other.

In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

In English, this sentence translates to, \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get,\\" which is a famous quote from the movie \\"Forrest Gump.\\" This Spanish sentence is an excellent example of using a metaphor to express the unpredictability and vast array of experiences that life offers. The metaphor refers to a box of chocolates, where each chocolate represents a unique experience or event, and while they may appear similar from the outside, they differ in flavor and texture on the inside. This holds true for life as well, where one can never predict what it might bring: joys, sorrows, or unexpected turns of events. Using idiomatic expressions and metaphors in language helps to convey complex ideas with simple, relatable, and memorable comparisons. They often touch upon cultural values and shared beliefs, making them an integral part of learning and understanding different languages. In addition to Spanish, there are many other languages where similar expressions can be found, such as \\"C'est la vie\\" in French, \\"Das Leben ist kein Ponyhof\\" in German, and \\"–¢–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å\\" in Russian, all of which convey the notion of accepting life's unpredictability and taking it in stride. Language learning is a fascinating journey filled with countless idioms, proverbs, and expressions that not only improve linguistic skills but also help in understanding the nuanced cultural context in which they are rooted.

Moreover, being multilingual has cognitive benefits, including improved problem-solving, critical-thinking abilities, and enhanced creativity.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Charles Sumner Frost (May 31, 1856 December 11, 1931) was an American architect.

The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States.

To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\".

The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Lake County is a county in the northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 703,462, making it the third-most populous county in Illinois. Its county seat is Waukegan.

If they couldn't win a big game together, as they had so often, Forbes would have to do enough for the two. Behind Forbes' career-high 32 points, No. 1 Michigan State outlasted Oakland 99-93 in overtime on Tuesday night, the Spartans' first game since Valentine had minor knee surgery on Monday morning. \\"A lot of guys stepped up,\\" Forbes said. \\"A lot of guys did things they had to do.\\" No. 1 on that list was Forbes, who hit seven 3s in nine attempts, including one in overtime that he celebrated by slapping hands with former Michigan State star Mateen Cleaves. Eron Harris added 27 points for the Spartans (13-0), who locked up the best start in school history after trailing by as many as 15 points in the first half. \\"I'm not really worried about the points I scored,\\" Harris said. \\"That's what I'm supposed to do. I'm just glad I got to be part of the win and making history.\\" Kay Felder, the nation's No. 2 scorer, had 37 points and nine assists for the Golden Grizzlies (7-4). With his 38 points in a win at Washington, Felder had 75 points in less than 72 hours. \\"I was just out there trying to play Oakland basketball the whole time,\\" said Felder who fouled out with 49 seconds left in overtime. The Spartans trailed 50-37 at halftime but surged to a five-point lead late in regulation. Felder answered at the line, where he was 14 for 18. \\"I was disappointed in my team in the first half, especially in the defense we played,\\" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. \\"That had nothing to do with Denzel Valentine. Felder looked like one of the best players I've ever seen here.\\" It took big plays at both ends from Matt Costello and a key basket from Deyonta Davis to get the job done for Michigan State in the extra 5 minutes. Costello finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while Davis had 11 points. Jalen Hayes, a teammate of Forbes and Valentine at Lansing Sexton High, had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Oakland, which shot 50 percent from the field in the first half but just 26.9 in the second. The Golden Grizzlies didn't have a basket in seven attempts in the overtime. \\"Everyone in this place thought they were going to make a run at us,\\" Oakland coach Greg Kampe said of the crowd at The Palace. \\"I said, \`Let's be the team that makes the run and get it up to 20.' But that's Michigan State. That's what they did. Eventually, they became what they are.\\" It wasn't the first time Oakland had scared the Spartans. But once again, Michigan State made just enough plays to escape with the win. \\"I kind of feel bad for Greg,\\" Izzo said. \\"He has a hell of a team.

To do that against Michigan State ....\\" With two jumpers and consecutive dunks from Costello and Davis, the Spartans answered with a 9-0 run to cut a 15-point deficit to 34-28.

Oakland was 39 of 48. \\"If we fight like we did today, we should be able to win every game,\\" Felder said. \\"We want to get to the NCAA and not just lose the first game.

OptionsÔºö A. manicure the lawn B. garden backyards C. water plants D. grow plants E. pick flowers A:","output":"A gardener is a professional who is responsible for maintaining and nurturing the growth and appearance of plants and landscapes in a garden, yard, or other outdoor space. The primary reason for having a gardener is to ensure the health and attractiveness of the plants and overall landscape. While each of the options provided may be considered as responsibilities of a gardener, option A, manicure the lawn, best captures the core purpose of hiring this professional. Manicuring the lawn encompasses various tasks that contribute to the well-being and visual appeal of the garden. These tasks include mowing, fertilizing, weeding, and watering. By performing these duties, a gardener enables the lawn to grow uniformly, maintain an ideal height and thickness, and possess a vibrant appearance, free of weeds or other undesirable growths. In addition to manicuring the lawn, the other options listed are also important aspects of a gardener's role. For instance, option B, garden backyards, includes creating appealing flowerbeds, efficient vegetable gardens, and well-groomed pathways around the property. Option C, water plants, entails the gardener ensuring plants receive sufficient water either through regular irrigation or hand-watering, depending on plant types and their specific requirements. Option D, grow plants, refers to the gardener's responsibility for planting seeds or transplanting seedlings and saplings, monitoring the health of each plant, and ensuring they reach maturity without any diseases or pest infestations. Gardeners also suggest the most suitable plants for a particular area, taking into consideration factors such as soil and climate conditions. Lastly, option E, pick flowers, entails the gardener selecting flowers for various uses, such as decorative purposes or satisfaction of a client's specific needs and preferences. This process involves making knowledgeable decisions about the appropriate time to harvest flowers in order to ensure optimal freshness and longevity. To summarize, the primary reason for having a gardener is to manicure the lawn, ensuring a visually appealing and healthy outdoor space. Although the other options are indeed tasks that a gardener performs, option A best captures the essence of their profession and demonstrates the comprehensive skills and knowledge required to maintain a vibrant, thriving garden."},{"instruction":"AmeriGas, operatingIncome, 380700000; AmeriGas, country, United States; AmeriGas, numberOfEmployees, 8500; AmeriGas, foundingDate, 1959-01-01 What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","output":"AmeriGas, a propane distribution company founded on January 1, 1959, is based in the United States and has an operating income of 380,700,000.

Here's what others are saying or doing: China A neighbor and often an ally of Russia, China is distancing itself from Russia's troop movements. \\"It is China's long-standing position not to interfere in others' internal affairs,\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang said. \\"We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\\" At the same time, Qin suggested that Ukraine isn't completely faultless. \\"There has been a distinct change in the tone of the markets today as the OPTIONS: - Angela Merkel-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - CNN-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - China-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Chinese Foreign Ministry-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Crimea-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - European Union-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - German-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Putin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Qin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Qin Gang-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Russia-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - U.S.-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Ukraine-Ukraine crisis stabilizes.","output":"Correct Answer(s): - \\"China-Ukraine crisis stabilizes.\\" Explanation: The paragraph quotes a major player in the ongoing situation - China - and cites a statement from its Foreign Ministry. The talk about the \\"distinct change in the tone\\" likely refers to the feedback and response from these stakeholders. Why other answers are wrong: - \\"Angela Merkel-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"German-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" are incorrect because Angela Merkel and Germany weren't mentioned in the paragraph. - \\"CNN-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is also incorrect. Even though the source is CNN, the network itself doesn't play a role within the events of the story. - \\"Chinese Foreign Ministry-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is not a complete fit as the paragraph refers directly to China and its stance, not the Ministry alone. - \\"Crimea-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" would be incorrect because Crimea is the subject of dispute, not an active player in the geopolitics. - It's similar with the \\"European Union-Ukraine crisis stabilizes,\\" as the EU wasn't mentioned. - \\"Putin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"Russia-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" are incorrect because these entities are causing the situation, not responding to it. - \\"Qin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"Qin Gang-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" aren't fitting as they are individual personalities and the sentence requires a collective response. - \\"U.S.-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is irrelevant here, as the paragraph does not discuss the U.S.'s response to a stabilization of the crisis. - \\"Ukraine-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is incorrect because it would be redundant and odd for Ukraine to react to its own crisis in this context.

What is a very short summary of the above text?","output":"A former official from Anhui Province, East China, convicted of corruption, has sued a reporter for writing that she used sexual favors for career progression. Could you please elaborate further on the situation? Reporters play a critical role in bringing to light essential news relating to various issues, including corruption cases. However, they also bear the responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their reporting and respect individuals' reputations. In this specific case happening in East China's Anhui Province, there involves an ex-official convicted of graft who has become the center of attention. Graft is a form of corruption where an official uses their station or status to gain personal benefit, violating their duties and the rights of others. It's a widespread issue in many regions around the world, and China, unfortunately, is no stranger to it, having encountered several high-profile graft cases throughout its recent history. The disgraced official in question here decided to take legal action against a reporter. This reporter's alleged claim is that this official traded sexual favors in return for career advancement, a serious charge that adds a different, potentially more pernicious layer to the graft conviction. These allegations imply that she had exploited her sexuality to achieve her professional objectives, which, if true, gives a darker undertone to the initial graft case. On the other hand, if these accusations are unfounded, they can represent a case of defamation, which is the act of damaging someone's good reputation by making false statements. Defamation can be extremely harmful, leading to serious emotional distress and damage to a person's reputation that can be hard to repair. Therefore, it's understandable why the ex-official would want to defend herself against such serious allegations, even amidst a graft conviction. This case represents a complex blend of corruption and potential defamation, all of which will need to be carefully investigated to ensure that justice is done. Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it underscores the need for greater transparency, accountability, and respect for individual rights in both the realm of politics and journalism. This incident will no doubt spark debate on the dynamics of power, gender, and media ethics, particularly in regions like East China's Anhui Province where graft has been an issue. Ultimately, the ramifications of this case will extend beyond just the individuals involved, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of corruption and media practices in the region and perhaps in other parts of China as well."},{"instruction":"In December 1998 , a 33-year-old woman died when she was hit by a metal cleat that came loose from the Columbia sailing ship .

Hypothesis: There will be more software development in the future. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis \\"There will be more software development in the future\\" is entailed by the premise \\"Software Size: This indicator records changes in the expected magnitude of the software development effort,\\" we must first define the terms involved and then examine their relations and implications. Premise: Software Size In the context of this premise, the term \\"software size\\" refers to a metric assessing the expected magnitude of software development effort. This can include parameters such as lines of code, function points, or other criteria to measure the complexity and work necessary to complete a software project. The notion of \\"expected magnitude\\" indicates that predictions or estimations about the scope of work and effort in the software development process are being made. By recording changes in the expected magnitude of software development effort, one can track how the scale of projects or the complexity of software solutions evolves as they respond to changing needs, technologies, or market conditions. Hypothesis: More software development in the future The hypothesis proposes that there will be an increasing amount of software development work in the future. More specifically, it suggests a growth in the number of projects, the scale of work, and the dedication of resources and personnel to software development endeavors. Entailment Relationship Now, let's assess if the given premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment refers to a relation where the truth of one statement logically implies the truth of another statement. In this case, it would mean that if we know the premise to be true, the hypothesis would also necessarily be true. Here, the premise states that there's an indicator that records the changes in the expected magnitude of software development effort. While the premise indicates that this indicator can help to track and make predictions about the software development domain, it does not convey any specific information about the direction of future changes. The indicator could reveal an upward or downward trend, or even periods of fluctuation or stability. As a result, the hypothesis, which predicts a growth in software development efforts, is not necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise simply provides a tool for tracking changes in software development efforts over time, but does not guarantee a particular outcome, such as a consistent increase in future efforts. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"There will be more software development in the future\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"Software Size: This indicator records changes in the expected magnitude of the software development effort.\\" While the premise does establish an indicator to track changes in software development effort, it does not make a specific claim or imply a direction of change; hence, it does not logically imply that there will be more software development in the future."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Originally, he called himself Diamond Darrell Lance. The band was influenced with thrash metal acts such as Slayer, Megadeth, Venom, and Metallica as well as traditional metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, and Judas Priest. Shortly after singer Phil Anselmo joined Pantera, Darrell was invited by Dave Mustaine to join Megadeth. Darrell was willing to join, but on the condition that Mustaine also hire his brother Vinnie on drums. As Mustaine already had a drummer, Chuck Behler, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera. Pantera would go on to become a key formulator of the post-thrash subgenre of \\"groove\\" metal. It would not be until nine years after forming that Pantera saw its first piece of commercial success in its 1990 major label debut, Cowboys from Hell. Pantera's \\"groove\\" style came to fruition in its breakthrough album Vulgar Display of Power, released on February 25, 1992, which saw the replacement of the power metal falsetto vocals with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar sound. On Pantera's 1994 album Far Beyond Driven, Abbott, who'd been listed on all prior albums under the moniker \\"Diamond Darrell\\", was listed as \\"Dimebag Darrell\\". On the night before Pantera's live appearance at the Monsters of Rock in England's Donington Park, the Abbott brothers got involved in altercations at a local club with journalists from magazines Kerrang! and Raw. Pantera began to suffer from mounting tensions between band members in the mid-1990s, largely due to vocalist Phil Anselmo's rampant drug abuse. In 2001, the group went on hiatus, during which time Anselmo worked on side projects, such as Superjoint Ritual and Down. This caused more friction within the band, as the Abbott brothers kept waiting for Anselmo to become available to work with them again. The frustration with Anselmo led to their decision to disband Pantera in 2003. Answer this question \\"Did they release any more albums after that one?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"No, they did not release any more albums after that one."},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: : This is the official campaign raising funds for Chelsea Manning.

Upon her release on May 17th, she will have full control over all funds donated.*Chelsea Manning is a 29 year-old transgender woman and long-time leader in the LGBT community. She is a transparency activist, Guardian columnist, whistleblower and she is our close friend and family member.For the past seven years, Chelsea has been incarcerated. She survived solitary confinement, systemic denial of health care and years of being separated from her friends and community. Through it all she has remained a steadfast voice for liberty and justice and an inspiration to so many. We now have a chance to show our appreciation for all that she has given us.Following the commutation of her 35 year sentence, Chelsea will head home to Maryland on May 17, 2017 and we, her closest friends and family, are raising money to meet her survival needs.The majority of Chelsea‚Äôs adult life has been spent under the control of powerful institutions. Upon her release she will need logistical, emotional, and financial support to safely transition into the free world. For the first time in her life, Chelsea will have the opportunity to live freely as her authentic self, to grow her hair, engage with her friends, and build her own networks of love and support. We want her to have the tools to do that and to overcome the years of abuse she has experience in custody.Funds raised will be used to pay for Chelsea‚Äôs rent, utilities, health care, clothing and other living expenses for the first year after she is released.If you are interested in offering an in-kind donation or other support, please e-mail: CMreleaseneeds@gmail.com To learn more about Chelsea, check out her Twitter and Medium pages and her website (We have been receiving a lot of complaints about these photos.

When Chelsea Manning asked President Barack Obama to commute her prison sentence last November‚Äîafter more than six grueling years behind bars‚Äîfew thought she had much of a chance. The intense politics surrounding Manning‚Äôs conviction for the largest leak of state secrets in US history suggested that her freedom remained a long shot. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really think it would work,‚Äù Nancy Hollander, a criminal defense lawyer who represents Manning, told me recently. So it came as a shock on January 17 when Hollander fielded a call in her office in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from White House Counsel Neil Eggleston. The president had granted the commutation, Eggleston told her. Manning, who is now 29, would be released on May 17. ‚ÄúI screamed,‚Äù Hollander recalled, and then she ran down the hall to tell a colleague. ‚ÄúWe jumped around and danced and hugged.‚Äù In 2013, a military judge sentenced Manning to 35 years in prison, the longest punishment ever for a government whistleblower, for handing over a trove of classified and other sensitive documents to WikiLeaks, including US military battlefield logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and State Department diplomatic cables. In addition to embarrassing American officials, prosecutors said the revelations complicated US military operations and diplomatic work and put US soldiers at risk, although prosecutors acknowledged there was no evidence of any deaths resulting from the disclosures. ‚ÄúI want everyone to know the real me,‚Äù Manning announced through a lawyer the day after the sentencing. ‚ÄúI am Chelsea Manning. I am a female.‚Äù Manning had already been locked up for three years before her conviction, beginning with about two months in isolation in Kuwait and then nine months in solitary confinement in the Quantico Marine Corps brig, where she was put on suicide watch and stripped of her clothing at night. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a nation of laws. We don‚Äôt individually make our own decisions about how the laws operate,‚Äù President Barack Obama said in April 2011, a year after Manning‚Äôs arrest, as protesters railed against the conditions she faced in detention. That month she was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she has remained ever since. After she was tried and convicted, Manning, who is slight and about 5-foot-3, came out as transgender. (She had grown up and joined the military using the name Bradley Manning, but privately she grappled with gender dysphoria, a mismatch between a person‚Äôs sex assigned at birth and their gender identity that can cause extreme distress.) The day after her sentencing in 2013, Manning announced, ‚ÄúI want everyone to know the real me,‚Äù in a statement read by one of her lawyers on the Today show. ‚ÄúI am Chelsea Manning. I am a female.‚Äù She also began battling for better treatment in prison and drew a fervent base of supporters, who saw her not only as a beacon for transgender rights, but also as a hero for helping show the effects of war on innocent civilians at the hands of the US military. Few expected mercy for Manning. Obama had prioritized going after leakers‚Äîhis administration prosecuted more of them than all previous administrations combined‚Äîand as his presidency wound down, he surely knew a commutation could be seen as a win for WikiLeaks, by then under fire for involvement in Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election. Republican Sen. John McCain described the commutation as a ‚Äúgrave mistake.‚Äù Sen. Lindsey Graham said it was a ‚Äúslap in the face‚Äù for other soldiers. Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump called Manning an ‚Äúungrateful traitor‚Äù after she wrote an op-ed suggesting that Obama had compromised too much with his political opponents during his presidency. Now, Manning faces a daunting challenge of another kind: adapting to life on the outside as a human rights advocate and a free woman. Manning grew up in rural Oklahoma with her sister and two parents who were alcoholics. She was bullied at school because of her effeminate mannerisms. In 2007, about three years before the leak, she enlisted in the Army and was later deployed to Iraq, where she worked as an intelligence analyst. She decided to share hundreds of thousands of sensitive files, she explained, ‚Äúout of concern for my country, the innocent civilians whose lives were lost as a result of war, and in support of‚Ä¶transparency and public accountability.‚Äù But at her trial she was remorseful, noting that she‚Äôd been ‚Äúdealing with a lot of issues‚Äù while in Iraq. Before the leak, Manning had sent an email to her supervisor with a photo of herself wearing makeup and a blonde wig. ‚ÄúThis is my problem,‚Äù Manning wrote to him. ‚ÄúI thought a career in the military would get rid of it‚Ä¶But it‚Äôs not going away; it‚Äôs haunting me more and more as I get older.‚Äù Strangio helped Manning sue to get hormone therapy‚Äîand she became the first person ever to receive treatment in a military prison for a gender transition. Inside the all-male military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Manning settled into a routine, the New York Times reported, waking up at 4:30 a.m. most mornings to apply her makeup and change into her uniform before the other inmates rose for the day. She worked in the prison wood shop and spent much of her free time reading, studying math or encryption, and writing. Those who know her explain she‚Äôs not always so serious. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a total millennial,‚Äù says her lawyer Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of her closest confidants. Though she doesn‚Äôt have internet access in prison, she started posting on Twitter in 2015 by dictating tweets to her supporters via phone. When they talk, Strangio says, she‚Äôll ask for updates about Taylor Swift‚Äôs Instagram account or what celebrities were wearing at the Golden Globes. But Manning has had to fight for her right to live as a woman. During her early days at Fort Leavenworth, Strangio says, she was optimistic that if she made a formal request for hormone therapy, she‚Äôd get it. ‚ÄúOne thing people don‚Äôt understand about Chelsea is she is an incredibly patriotic person who has a tremendous amount of faith in our democracy, and‚Ä¶she was very confident they were going to provide her the treatment she needed,‚Äù Strangio says. She was wrong. Though military doctors diagnosed her with gender dysphoria and recommended she live and be treated as a woman, the Army denied her hormone therapy. Strangio helped her sue to get it‚Äîand she became the first person ever to receive treatment in a military prison for a gender transition. She also got permission to wear female undergarments and cosmetics, but the military, citing security risks, denied her requests to grow her hair long like other women prisoners. ‚ÄúShe was just so devastated,‚Äù says Strangio, who is himself transgender. Every haircut was a painful reminder, he said, that ‚Äúshe is seen and treated as a man even though she‚Äôs a woman.‚Äù ‚ÄúHair is the most important signifier of femininity in American society,‚Äù Manning wrote to Obama as part of her commutation request in November. ‚Äú[I]t is especially important to me as a person confined in an all-male environment, so not being given access to this, while receiving other treatment, has been a never-ending nightmare.‚Äù In July, Manning tried to kill herself. Her mental health had deteriorated, her attorneys said, because of the military‚Äôs refusal to adequately treat her gender dysphoria. (It was her first suicide attempt in prison, though Strangio said she‚Äôd previously had suicidal thoughts linked to her arrest and inadequate treatment.) In October, prison officials punished her for the July suicide attempt by putting her isolation, where she reportedly tried to choke herself on a piece of clothing before guards stopped her. Strangio, based in New York, traveled down to the Kansas prison after both suicide attempts. While he felt that they had grown close‚ÄîManning called him regularly to talk about books, family, politics, and the Pulse nightclub massacre‚Äîthe two had not yet met in person. ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt had many visits from family,‚Äù noted Strangio, who is 34. ‚ÄúA lot of the sustained visits she‚Äôs had over the years have been from lawyers.‚Äù Manning and her lawyers began talking about a push for a commutation. ‚ÄúI was feeling that her life was in jeopardy and she wasn‚Äôt going to survive much longer,‚Äù Strangio says. ‚ÄúThe years of trauma that were building up was such that another year seemed difficult to imagine.‚Äù She had about 28 years remaining on her sentence. A UN investigator had described the conditions of her isolation at Quantico as ‚Äúcruel, inhuman, and degrading.‚Äù At Leavenworth, she was disciplined when prison officials found toothpaste in her cell that had expired‚Äîthey called it ‚Äúmedicine misuse.‚Äù Last September, she stopped eating to protest what she described as ‚Äúconstant, deliberate and overzealous administrative scrutiny‚Äù by prison officials and to call for better treatment for her gender dysphoria. The hunger strike led to a promise from the military that she would receive sex reassignment surgery. (She will not have the surgery before her release.) During her confinement in isolation in October, she appeared to experience disturbing hallucinations, according to a doctor who studies solitary confinement. ‚ÄúI need help and I am still not getting it,‚Äù Manning wrote to Obama in November, pleading for a commutation. ‚ÄúI am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss, and depression.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI have‚Ä¶been placed in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure for an attempted suicide despite a growing effort‚Äîled by the President of the United States‚Äîto stop the use of solitary confinement for any purpose. These experiences have broken me and made me feel less than human.‚Äù On January 11, NBC reported that Manning had made it onto Obama‚Äôs short list for commutations. Two days later, White House press secretary Josh Earnest mentioned her case during a press briefing, saying that unlike National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, she had apologized for her actions. ‚ÄúChelsea Manning is somebody who went through the military criminal justice process, was exposed to due process, was found guilty, was sentenced for her crimes, and she acknowledged wrongdoing,‚Äù Earnest said. ‚ÄúMr. Snowden fled into the arms of an adversary and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had this moment of sitting back and looking out the window at the city, being like, ‚ÄòWow, Chelsea could actually be freed.‚Äô I almost started crying.‚Äù Her attorneys were still cautious, but ‚Äúon the train home that night, I was just watching that press briefing over and over,‚Äù says Strangio. ‚ÄúI had this moment of sitting back and looking out the window at the city, being like, ‚ÄòWow, Chelsea could actually be freed.‚Äô I almost started crying.‚Äù The next week, Obama‚Äôs last in office, the president commuted the bulk of Manning‚Äôs sentence. (He also granted 64 pardons and 208 other commutations for lower-profile offenders that day.) ‚ÄúIt has been my view that‚Ä¶she took responsibility for her crime; that the sentence that she received was very disproportional‚Äîdisproportionate relative to what other leakers had received; and that she had served a significant amount of time,‚Äù Obama said. (Manning‚Äôs sentence was 10 times longer than the next longest sentence ever imposed on a government whistleblower, according to the ACLU.) Speaking generally about Obama‚Äôs philosophy toward commutations, Eggleston told the Marshall Project that the president tended to feel ‚Äúvery strongly about the idea of rehabilitation and second chances.‚Äù ‚ÄúI really do believe that he saved her life,‚Äù Strangio says of Manning‚Äôs commutation. After the announcement, Manning‚Äôs lawyers waited anxiously for their client to call. ‚ÄúEverybody started getting concerned because nobody heard from her,‚Äù says Hollander. (They later learned that Manning wasn‚Äôt able to immediately get to a phone; prison officials had moved her on the day of the commutation announcement, likely for security reasons.) The next day, Hollander and Strangio phoned Manning. ‚ÄúShe was a little bit numb still,‚Äù Hollander says of the call. ‚ÄúIt had been a hard night for her because she had been alone and hadn‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone. Imagine you get this news and then you can‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Ä¶[Strangio] and I were all excited, trying to get her more excited about it. She was just starting to process it at that point.‚Äù After Manning is released on May 17, she plans to move to Maryland, where she lived with her aunt before joining the Army. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt know every bit about what her life is going to look like,‚Äù says Strangio, ‚Äúbut one theme with Chelsea is always a commitment to advocacy‚Äîfor the trans community and for her visions for justice more broadly.‚Äù That includes the importance of government transparency and net neutrality and privacy, according to Strangio. He has helped raise more than 115,000 as part of a ‚ÄúWelcome Home Fund‚Äù to cover Manning‚Äôs rent, utilities, health care, and other expenses during her first year out. ‚ÄúFor the first time in her life, Chelsea will have the opportunity to live freely as her authentic self,‚Äù he wrote in the fundraising appeal. ‚ÄúWe want her to have the tools to do that and to overcome the years of abuse she has experienced in custody.‚Äù While Strangio helps Manning get back on her feet, Hollander will continue to work on the long process of a legal appeal to overturn Manning‚Äôs conviction. With her release approaching, ‚Äúevery day feels like it‚Äôs going in slow motion,‚Äù Manning tweeted in mid-April, soon adding, ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôve been in prison for a while, when the prospect of freedom is nerve wracking.‚Äù Then, with just a few weeks to go, she wrote, ‚ÄúThe nightmare will end, soon.

It can be used in a wide variety of styles and dishes. Knowing which dish you will be frying beef for will help determine the exact seasoning you will need. Place the beef and seasoning into the bowl and mix with your hands until the seasoning is fully incorporated. Place a skillet with oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil has heated place your ground beef in the skillet and stir it with a utensil, like a wooden spoon, spatula, or fork until brown. Break up any clumps of meat to ensure that all of the ground beef is cooked to the same temperature, will most likely be well-done. Use seasonings like thyme, fresh garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper for more European style dishes, like lasagna, shepherd's pie, bolognese. Try adding spices like paprika, cayenne, chili powder, or fresh cilantro for latin style dishes, like tacos, Picadillo, or chillis. Preheat your oven to 350F and let it cycle for about 45 minutes. Season your steaks with your desired spices and begin to heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot place one side of the steak down in the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes. Searing locks in the flavor of the steak as well as creates a ‚Äúcaramelized‚Äù or heavily flavored crust. If your steak is large or thick you may need to finish it in the oven. Some thinner steaks, like flank steak or skirt steak, can be cooked quickly just by searing. Steak that come thicker or with edges that need to seared are T-bones, Porterhouses, New York strips, and Ribeyes. Let the steak rest on a cooling rack, cutting board, or plate for about 10 to fifteen minutes to let the steak finish cooking and reabsorb its juices. Burgers can be made on a stovetop as easily as they can be grilled. Choose a ground beef with your desired fat content, season well with spices and herbs, and form your patties. Heat a skillet with oil over medium-high heat and place the patties in once the oil is hot. Your cooking time will vary depending on what your desired temperature is and how thick the patties are. A general rule is that patties that are 1 inch thick will take around 4-6 minutes a side to cook. Make a stir fry. Stir frys can be an excellent source of protein and vegetables, and they are relatively simple and easy to cook. Many butchers already have beef cut to stir fry size, which can be anywhere from small cubes to thin slices. You‚Äôll need to heat a walled skillet or wok with oil over a medium-high heat, then add your beef to brown quickly, followed by your vegetables and an accompanying sauce. Add sauces like soy sauce and oyster sauce to give your stir fry even more flavor. Beef in stir fries cook very quickly. Don‚Äôt worry about over cooking the beef as they will likely be well done regardless.

Though they may not directly engage in the game's physicality, their sharp precision and timely scoring ability can be the thin line between victory and defeat. One name that stands out in the world of placekickers is David Akers, a former NFL standout who spent more than a decade assisting his teams in climbing to the highest peaks of American football. In this article, we will explore Akers' accomplishments, specifically by answering the question: How many field goals did Akers kick during his professional career? David Akers: The Journey from Rookie to Pro-Bowler Born on December 9, 1974, in Lexington, Kentucky, David Roy Akers would grow up to become one of the most accurate and consistent placekickers in NFL history. Although his initial entry to the NFL was unassuming - as an undrafted free agent in 1997 - Akers' perseverance and unwavering dedication to his craft would soon set him on a path to greatness. He began his career with the Atlanta Falcons before joining the Washington Redskins for a season. However, it was with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999 when things began to look up for Akers. From 1999 to 2010, Akers was a staple on the Eagles' roster, participating in five Pro Bowls and achieving two All-Pro honors. After a successful run in Philadelphia, he played for the San Francisco 49ers for two seasons, and he concluded his career with the Detroit Lions in 2013. A Field Goal Tally to Remember Throughout Akers' illustrious 16-year NFL career, he was no stranger to making high-pressure kicks with formidable accuracy. So, how many field goals did he make in his tenure? Examining the available statistics on David Akers' professional career, we find that he accumulated a total of 386 successful field goals, out of 477 attempted kicks. This impressive track record places Akers 12th on the all-time list of successful field goals made in NFL history. His field goal percentage of 80.9% demonstrates his remarkable consistency and reliability throughout his career. Akers' regular-season field goals were not the only highlight of his career. David also had a penchant for shining bright in playoff matches. During his postseason appearances, Akers successfully completed 39 field goals out of 45 attempts. This record made him the all-time leader for postseason field goals before he was surpassed by Adam Vinatieri and Stephen Gostkowski. Legacy and Conclusion Over his 16-year career, David Akers had undoubtedly made a significant impact on the numerous teams he played for and their successes throughout the years. With a total of 386 field goals during the regular season and an additional 39 in the playoffs, Akers etched his name in the annals of NFL history, proving that hard work, dedication, and the ability to perform under pressure can take an undrafted free agent to the pinnacle of his profession. As we look back on the storied career of David Akers, it's hard not to be in awe of the sheer number of clutch moments he provided for his teams, helping snatch victory from the jaws of defeat on countless occasions. Through his on-field successes, Akers has left an indelible mark on the NFL, ensuring his place in the pantheon of the greatest placekickers to ever grace the league."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Oka is a river in central Russia, the largest right tributary of the Volga. It flows through the regions of Oryol, Tula, Kaluga, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir, and Nizhny Novgorod and is navigable over a large part of its total length, as far upstream as to the town of Kaluga. Its length exceeds . The Russian capital Moscow sits on one of the Oka's tributariesthe Moskva River. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - A waterway is any navigable body of water. A shipping route consists of one or several waterways. Waterways can include rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, and canals. In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria: - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of . - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Lama River ( Russian : ) is a river in the Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia , a tributary of the Shosha River . The river is 139 kilometres ( 86 mi ) long . The area of its drainage basin is 2,330 square kilometres ( 900 sq mi ) . The Lama River freezes up in November and stays under the ice until late March or early April . Historically , the river was a part of the important waterway from the Volga River to the Moskva River . The city of Volokolamsk that has been standing on the Lama River since the 12th century was previously known as Volok Lamsky ( literally - Drag of Lama ) after the process of a watercraft portage . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Volokolamsk is a town and the administrative center of Volokolamsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Gorodenka River, not far from its confluence with the Lama River, northwest of Moscow. Population: - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - The Moskva River (\\"Moskva-reka\\") is a river of western Russia. It rises about west of Moscow, and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblasts, passing through central Moscow. About south east of Moscow, at the city of Kolomna, it flows into the Oka River, itself a tributary of the Volga, which ultimately flows into the Caspian Sea. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - Shosha River is a river in Zubtsovsky, Staritsky, Kalininsky and in Konakovsky Districts of Tver Oblast and Lotoshinsky District of Moscow Oblast in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Volga River. The length of the Shosha River is . The area of its basin is . The river flows into the Ivankovo Reservoir. The Shosha freezes up in November through early January and stays icebound until late March or early April. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Ivankovo Reservoir or Ivankovskoye Reservoir, informally known as the Moscow Sea, is the uppermost reservoir on the Volga River, in Moscow and Tver Oblasts of Russia, located some 130 km north of Moscow. The dam of the reservoir is situated in the town of Dubna. The town of Konakovo is located on its southern coast. The reservoir is connected to the Moskva River by the Moscow Canal, and is the principal fresh water source for the city of Moscow. Its area is , and the area of its drainage basin is . - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.

The family was originally from New York City, where his older brother Nick, of the boy band Backstreet Boys, was born. In addition to his brother Nick, he also has three sisters: twin sister Angel (a model), B.J. and Leslie (1986-2012). Carter is named after his paternal grandfather, Aaron Charles Carter, and his maternal grandfather, Douglas \\"Charles\\" Spaulding. Carter's next album, Another Earthquake!, was released on September 3, 2002, during the \\"Rock, Rap, and Retro\\" tour. The album featured the patriotic-themed \\"America A.O.\\" and the ballad \\"Do You Remember\\". He guest starred on three episodes of the Nickelodeon TV show, All That and sang the theme song to the PBS animated series Liberty's Kids, titled \\"Through my own Eyes.\\" During that time, Carter's parents filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Lou Pearlman (now deceased), in 2002 alleging failure to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties on Carter's 1998 album, which was released through Pearlman's label and production company, Trans Continental. On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order to produce documents relating to royalty payments. Carter had also dated Lindsay Lohan along with his girlfriend Hilary Duff at the same time (leading to a feud between the two), but he broke up with Lohan in April 2003, and resumed dating Duff. Later, that same year, he reportedly cheated on her and Duff ended their on-and-off relationship after two years. Carter's Most Requested Hits, a collection including tracks from his last three albums as well as a new single, \\"One Better\\", was released on November 3, 2003. \\"Saturday Night\\", which was released on March 22, 2005 and was promoted by Carter during his summer 2005 Remix Tour. The song was released by Trans Continental label, with Lou Pearlman as executive producer. The single was also featured in the soundtrack of the film Popstar, in which Carter starred. The direct-to-video film was based heavily on his own life as a performer. A real-life motocross racer, Carter also appeared in 2005's Supercross. On March 21, 2006, Trans Continental filed a lawsuit against Carter within the Los Angeles Superior Court, citing that Carter allegedly reneged on a recording deal. Carter had signed the contract on December 7, 2004, when he was 17 and underage. His attorney however stated that Carter had the right to \\"cancel or void various agreements\\" that were signed when he was a minor. Carter and his siblings starred in a reality show, House of Carters, which ran in October-November 2006 on E!. The series features all five Carter siblings reuniting to live in the same house. On September 18, 2006, it was reported that Carter was engaged to former beauty queen and Playboy model Kari Ann Peniche.

Context: The Earth's inner core is the Earth's innermost part. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 kilometres (760 miles), which is about 70 % of the Moon's radius. It is composed of an iron -- nickel alloy and some light elements. The temperature at the inner core boundary is approximately 5700 K (5400 ¬∞ C). Question: composition of the inner core of the earth? Answer. an iron -- nickel alloy and some light elements What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"The composition of Earth's inner core is deduced through a combination of scientific observations and theoretical inferences that focus on seismic waves, Earth's magnetic field, and high-pressure experiments. The step-by-step reasoning justifying the conclusion that the Earth's inner core is composed of an iron-nickel alloy and some light elements are as follows: 1. Seismic wave observations: Seismic waves are generated by various events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or explosions. Geologists record these waves using seismographs that detect and measure vibrations in the Earth's crust. Observations of seismic waves reveal that there are two distinct types of waves: P-waves (primary or compressional) and S-waves (secondary or shear). P-waves travel through both solids and liquids, while S-waves travel only through solids. 2. S-wave shadow zone and inner-outer core boundary: When seismic waves propagate through the Earth, they reveal key information about Earth's internal structure by experiencing changes in velocity, absorption, and reflection at different layers. The P-wave changes suggest that Earth's outer core is liquid, further supported by the fact that S-waves do not pass through Earth's outer core, forming an S-wave shadow zone. The absence of S-waves in the outer core indicates the presence of a solid inner core. 3. Iron content in the core: Researchers believe that Earth's core is primarily composed of iron due to several reasons. Earth has an abundance of iron, which is a common element in meteorites, and is thought to be one of the primary building blocks of our planet. Also, Earth's density distribution suggests that a denser element must be present in the core. Iron is one of the few elements with a high enough density to match the observed density structure of Earth. 4. Earth's magnetic field: The Earth's magnetic field is created through a process called the geodynamo, which arises from the continuous motion of conductive molten iron in the outer core. The presence of iron in the core helps support the production of Earth's magnetic field. Since the inner core is solid, it is believed to be primarily composed of an iron alloy. 5. Presence of nickel and lighter elements: Evidence from iron meteorites, which are believed to be remnants of early planetary bodies, shows that they contain a significant proportion of nickel in addition to iron. Moreover, high-pressure experiments with iron and nickel alloys reveal that the coexistence of an iron-nickel outer core and an inner core would result in the same densities observed for Earth's structure. Alongside iron and nickel, some lighter elements, such as sulfur, oxygen, or silicon, are suspected to be part of the core composition to explain the density and physical properties of the core, but their presence and specific amounts are still a matter of scientific debate. In summary, the composition of Earth's inner core has been determined through seismological observations, density distribution, Earth's magnetic field, meteorite studies, and high-pressure experiments. These lines of evidence support the conclusion that the inner core is primarily composed of an iron-nickel alloy and some lighter elements."},{"instruction":"Apple's Newton was a failure for its maker, but not for the die-hard Newton community.

Wait for the base coat to dry.\\"","output":"Title: Embracing the Art of Painting: Tips and Tricks for Perfecting Your Base Coat Application Introduction: Painting is both an art and a skill, offering limitless opportunities for self-expression and creativity. Although many people assume that learning to paint is just about picking up a brush and slapping on some color, the process is, in fact, much more intricate. To achieve a vibrant, lasting, and professional finish, you must pay close attention to every detail, starting with the application of a base coat. In this article, we'll explore the whys and hows of applying a base coat in one of your main colors, as well as the fundamental techniques and considerations required to ensure a successful outcome. Why Apply a Base Coat? A base coat is a foundation layer of paint that sets the stage for additional colors and effects. Applying a base coat has multiple benefits: 1. It unifies the painting surface, providing a consistent base for the desired color tone. 2. It enhances the adhesion of subsequent layers, improving the overall stability of the artwork. 3. It prevents uneven texture, reducing the risk of visible brush strokes or other surface imperfections. 4. It increases the longevity of the painting by protecting it from external elements such as light, humidity, and dust. Choosing Your Base Coat Color: Selecting the appropriate color for your base coat is crucial to achieving the desired effect. Typically, artists choose a base coat color that reflects their primary color scheme. This helps create a sense of coherence and harmony in the finished piece. When choosing your base coat color, consider the following factors: 1. Tonal value: Aim for a mid-tone color that can be easily adjusted with darker or lighter shades. 2. Color harmony: Consider how your chosen base coat color will interact with other colors in your composition. Make sure they complement each other rather than creating unwanted contrasts. 3. Emotional impact: Remember that colors evoke emotions. Choose a color that sets the desired emotional response for your artwork. Preparing the Painting Surface: Before applying the base coat, it's crucial to prepare the painting surface correctly. This involves: 1. Cleaning: Ensure the surface is free of dust, dirt, and oils. For best results, use a mild detergent and water to clean the area thoroughly, then allow it to dry completely. 2. Priming: Priming creates a receptive barrier between the surface and the paint, preventing the paint from soaking into the material, enhancing adhesion, and sealing any imperfections. Most artists recommend using a quality gesso to prime your surface. Base Coat Application ‚Äì The Process: Having chosen your color, prepared your surface, and gathered your tools, it's time to apply the base coat. Follow these steps for a successful application: 1. Mix your paint: Combine your chosen base coat color with an appropriate paint medium. This will ensure smooth application and increase the longevity of your artwork. 2. Protect your workspace: Cover your work area with drop cloths or protective sheets to avoid potential paint spills or accidents. 3. Apply the base coat: Using a suitable brush or painting tool, evenly apply the base coat to your entire painting surface. Work in long, steady strokes, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout. 4. Fix any imperfections: While your base coat is still wet, use a clean brush or tool to correct any visible brush strokes, marks, or inconsistencies. 5. Allow the base coat to dry: Patience is key when waiting for your base coat to dry. Depending on the paint type and environmental factors, drying time can range from a few hours to several days. Refrain from adding additional layers or making adjustments until the base coat is entirely dry. Conclusion: The foundation of any successful painting lies in the proper application of a base coat. Through careful color selection, surface preparation, and attentive technique, artists can create a lasting, vibrant work of art that resonates both visually and emotionally. By understanding the importance of a base coat and honing the skills required for its application, you can open the door to new levels of artistic proficiency and creative expression."},{"instruction":"Jan was 2 years older than Cindy who was 5 so 2 + 5 = 7 years old.

Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\" Answer: A:","output":"In the given context, the word \\"innocent\\" was not used to describe Mary. Instead, the following epithets were applied to her: \\"in every respect holy,\\" \\"in all things unstained,\\" \\"super-innocent,\\" and \\"singularly holy.\\" These expressions emphasize Mary's sinlessness, which has been considered to include both original sin and actual sin. St. Augustine's statement further supports the idea that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin in all aspects."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

Sand bare wood lightly to open the pores in preparation for staining. Open the stain you have purchased and stir thoroughly, then apply with a bristle brush, foam brush or cloth evenly. The reason (B) is wrong is because you want the wood to be bare when you stain it. That means you want the wood to be clean and free of any paint or sealant. This allows the stain to soak into the wood, which changes the color. Imagine trying to color a picture that's already been colored - it won't work very well, right? The same goes for wood.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. What is an answer for this question: Which country would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, Germany or France? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Germany would be more likely to attract businesses requiring higher labor supply. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The Laffer curve shows that there is a critical point at which government revenue starts to decrease as the tax rate rises, due to a decline in labor supply. 2. After World War II, Germany implemented a tax rate below the critical rate while France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate. 3. According to the Laffer curve, decreasing tax rates should increase labor supply when tax rates are above the critical point. 4. Since Germany's tax rate is below the critical point, businesses operating there can expect a more favorable labor supply situation compared to France, where the tax rate is above the critical point. 5. Therefore, businesses requiring a higher labor supply would be more attracted to Germany due to its lower tax rates and more favorable labor supply conditions."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What is a form of interaction?\\" is in \\"Currently, the Regular Force component of the Army consists of three field-ready brigade groups: 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, at CFB Edmonton and CFB Shilo; 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, at CFB Petawawa and CFB Gagetown; and 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, at CFB Valcartier and Quebec City.

But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about.

Article:","output":"Title: Tarantino Wins Legal Battle Over Unproduced Movie Script Leak In January of this year, Quentin Tarantino, the renowned writer and director, found himself in a legal battle after links to an unproduced movie script were shared on a well-known website. Known for his original and groundbreaking works in film, Tarantino was quick to take action, filing a lawsuit against the website in question. However, the judge recently ruled in favor of Tarantino, stating that he did not show evidence of a copyright infringement. Despite this setback, Tarantino is reportedly revising the script and considering moving forward with the production of the film. The leak of the unproduced movie script initially caused a stir among fans and industry insiders alike, who eagerly awaited the latest project from the mastermind behind award-winning films like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. The legal battle that ensued was closely followed by those invested in Tarantino's work and the issue of intellectual property rights. Matters of copyright and intellectual property have been at the forefront of the entertainment industry for decades, only growing more complex in the digital age, with easier access to more information and the ever-present risk of leaks. With Tarantino's case making headlines, it has once again brought the discussion of copyright infringement and creative rights to the forefront of the industry's ongoing conversations and legal battles. Despite the judge's ruling, Quentin Tarantino remains undeterred, reportedly working on revisions to the script in question. This suggests that, despite what might be considered a legal loss, the famed director remains undaunted and continues to focus on his craft. While there is no confirmation as to whether the project will indeed move forward to become a film, fans of the iconic director and screenwriter will no doubt be eagerly awaiting any news on the development of this script. In conclusion, the legal battle over Tarantino's unproduced movie script highlights the ongoing concerns surrounding intellectual property rights and copyright infringement in the entertainment industry. As Tarantino revises the leaked script, the possibility of a new film from the acclaimed director remains on the horizon, illustrating that while the legal landscape may be complicated, creativity and artistry can still find a way to flourish."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Diaper Chump Review: We have 2 children in diapers, so our diaper pail is an essential piece of equipment. We retired our Diaper Genie and moved on the Diaper Champ because it doesn't require special bags. We were very disappointed in the performance. It did absolutely nothing for odor control. You could smell diapers down the hall. My son also found it very amusing to put his toys into the Diaper Champ, as it was a little too easy to operate. We switched back to the Diaper Genie. Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided by the customer, we can infer that they were dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ product. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion. Firstly, the customer mentions that they had high expectations for the Diaper Champ since it doesn't require special bags. However, they were disappointed with its performance when it came to odor control. The fact that they could smell diapers down the hall indicates that the product didn't meet their expectations in this area, which is a significant factor for any diaper pail's effectiveness. Secondly, the customer's son found it amusing to put his toys into the Diaper Champ, which suggests that the product was not designed optimally in terms of child safety and user friendliness. The ease with which their child could operate it points to a design flaw that could potentially lead to more dissatisfaction from the user's perspective. Lastly, the customer ultimately decided to switch back to the Diaper Genie, which shows their clear dissatisfaction with the Diaper Champ. By reverting to their previous diaper pail choice, they demonstrated that the Diaper Champ didn't offer a satisfactory solution to their diaper disposal needs. In conclusion, the customer was definitely dissatisfied with their experience using the Diaper Champ, as evidenced by their disappointment in the product's performance, concerns about its ease-of-use, and decision to switch back to their previous diaper pail choice."},{"instruction":"Long bus rides are like television shows.

Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless or daring, the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops.

Step 4: Add Ham Justify: Adding ham is the key component of the sandwich, providing protein and flavor. - Place 2-4 slices of ham onto one slice of bread (the one with condiments if you have only applied it to one side), ensuring even coverage. Step 5: Add Additional Ingredients (Optional) Justify: Additional ingredients such as cheese, lettuce, and tomato can enhance the sandwich by providing extra flavors, textures, and nutrients. - If desired, add a slice of cheese on top of the ham. - If desired, wash and pat-dry lettuce leaves and stack them on top of the cheese or ham. - If desired, wash and slice a tomato and place the slices on top of the cheeses or lettuce. Step 6: Assemble the Sandwich Justify: This step brings everything together to form the completed ham sandwich. - Place the other slice of bread on top of the sandwich, condiment-side down (if you applied condiments to both slices). - Press down lightly to help the sandwich hold together. Step 7: Cut and Serve Justify: Cutting the sandwich makes it easier to eat and serve. - Use a knife to cut the sandwich diagonally or straight down the middle. - Transfer the sandwich halves onto a plate and serve. Following these steps accomplishes the goal efficiently and ensures a consistent, satisfying ham sandwich every time."},{"instruction":"Oleg Smirnov (born April 8, 1980) is a Russian professional ice hockey right winger currently playing for HC Ryazan in the Russian Major League.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Paragraph: two buildings had different tenants.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

Why is the Golden Gate Bridge called golden when it's red? Who designed it and how was it built? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"I will first determine if the two questions are the same before proceeding to answer. Question 1: Why do they call the Golden Gate Bridge golden when it is red? Question 2: Why is the Golden Gate Bridge called golden when it's red? Who designed it and how was it built? Step 1: Compare the main subjects of both questions. Both questions clearly address the Golden Gate Bridge and the reason behind its \\"golden\\" name even though it's red. Step 2: Identify additional aspects covered in the questions. Question 2 additionally asks for information about the bridge's designer and construction process. Conclusion: The two questions are not the same, as Question 2 also covers the information about the bridge's designer and construction process, which is missing from Question 1. Now I will answer the combined questions: 1. The reason behind the name \\"Golden Gate Bridge\\" despite it being painted in a red-orange color. The name \\"Golden Gate\\" refers to the strait connecting the San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean, known as the Golden Gate Strait. The name was given by John C. Fr√©mont, who, in 1846, referred to the strait as the \\"Chrysopylae\\" (Golden Gate) due to its resemblance to the harbor entrance in Istanbul, Turkey, named Chrysoceras or Golden Horn. The bridge is named after the strait, not its color. The red-orange color is called International Orange, which was chosen for visibility purposes and its aesthetic appeal with the local environment. 2. The designer of the bridge and its construction process. Joseph Strauss was the leading designer of the Golden Gate Bridge, along with Leon Moisseiff (the main suspension bridge designer), Irving Morrow (responsible for the Art Deco design elements), and Charles Alton Ellis (who contributed to the structural design). The construction of the bridge began on January 5, 1933, and was completed on April 19, 1937. The construction involved a workforce of over thousands, and they faced various challenges like strong winds, tides, fog, and the construction site's depth. It was built using a combination of construction techniques and engineering feats, like using massive concrete anchors on each end, suspending two 746-foot-tall towers, and employing a spinning process to create the main support cables."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Half of the fat cats earning over ¬£150,000 did so through their basic salary. Thirty-four council employees were paid more than ¬£250,000. Highest UK package went to David Crawford, Glasgow‚Äôs director of social care, whose redundancy package and earnings was ¬£486,303. Article:","output":"Title: The Earnings of the UK's Public Sector \\"Fat Cats\\" Introduction: The term \\"fat cat\\" refers to wealthy individuals who earn substantial incomes, often in the public sector. In recent times, the United Kingdom has witnessed a rise in the salaries of high-ranking public sector employees, raising questions concerning income disparity and the fairness of these payouts. In this article, we will delve into the source of these large salaries, discuss the facts and figures surrounding them, and mention some notable individuals who have recently benefitted from such substantial remuneration. Earnings of Public Sector Employees: A recent study has revealed that nearly half of the public sector employees earning over ¬£150,000 did so through their basic salary, indicating that excessive income is not solely due to bonuses or other incentives. This fact highlights the apparent wage inflation within the higher tiers of the public sector, specifically focusing on the income disparity in the United Kingdom. In an age where austerity measures are being implemented across the nation, it is striking to see that thirty-four council employees received compensation packages amounting to more than ¬£250,000 in the last financial year. This figure demonstrates that despite budget cuts and financial constraints, there remains a sector of the workforce that continues to rake in substantial earnings. Exemplary Cases: One of the most significant cases in this scenario is David Crawford, Glasgow's director of social care, who received the highest UK package of a combined ¬£486,303 last year. This figure includes his redundancy package and other earnings. With social care being an area in desperate need of funding, it is particularly alarming that such a significant sum is allocated to one individual instead of being directed toward necessary resources or services. A Spotlight on Earnings and Income Disparity: As we examine these high salaries and compensation packages, it is essential to acknowledge that income disparity is a pressing issue within the country. A widening gap between the rich and poor has become an unfortunate reality in the United Kingdom. The revelation of these vast remunerations for public sector employees has sparked public indignation, leading to increased scrutiny of public spending, the role of taxation, and the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth. Moreover, it is crucial to consider the impact that these \\"fat cat\\" earnings may have on public morale and the perception of the public sector. With many workers in lower-ranking positions struggling to make ends meet, it becomes progressively challenging to justify the extravagant earning of a select few within the same working environment. As a result, there is growing concern that this income disparity may fuel a feeling of disillusionment and mistrust in the public sector, further widening the disconnect between the government and its citizens. Conclusion: The revelations concerning the earnings of high-ranking public sector employees in the United Kingdom have undoubtedly raised crucial questions about income disparity, fairness, and the allocation of resources. The public outcry surrounding these significant salaries has shone a spotlight on the need for a comprehensive review of public spending and wage structures. Ultimately, in order to protect the efficacy and integrity of the public sector, it is imperative that the United Kingdom works to address this income disparity, implement policies that promote equity, and foster an environment where all employees, regardless of rank or position, are fairly and reasonably compensated."},{"instruction":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

She played golf and used her connections to find clients that included Somerset Maugham and Samuel Beckett. She was involved with the noted production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1956 and holidayed with Maugham in France. She notably told John Osborne to \\"think again\\" about his play Look Back in Anger that transformed British theatre. Black was fluent in French and so in love with France that she was sometimes called \\"Noir\\". She created translations of plays that were enabled not only be her fluency in French but with her knowledge of theatre after reading so many plays as a literary agent. Her translations included Crime Passionel by Jean Paul Sartre. She also translated his play \\"Morts sans S√©pulture\\" and was thrilled when the director said that it was perfect. In partnership with Michael Flanders, she translated Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat for the Edinburgh Festival. The work played to capacity audiences in Edinburgh, and again in London at the Royal Festival Hall in 1956 with Flanders as the narrator, Sir Ralph Richardson as the Soldier and Peter Ustinov as the Devil.

United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"In international relations, the body of jurisprudence that generally defines treaties between nations is the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The VCLT is a multilateral treaty that establishes comprehensive rules, procedures, and guidelines for entering into, interpreting, and terminating treaties. It was adopted on May 23, 1969, and entered into force on January 27, 1980. The principles outlined in the VCLT are widely recognized as a reflection of customary international law, meaning they apply to all states, whether or not they are party to the Convention. The VCLT defines a treaty as \\"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation.\\" This broad definition encompasses various types of international agreements, including those referred to in the United States as treaties, executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. Although the VCLT provides a general framework for treaties, it should be noted that, as indicated in the context, domestic laws and practices often regulate the procedure of treaty-making and implementation. In the United States, the Constitution distinguishes between treaties, which require the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, and other international agreements that may be concluded by the President with varying degrees of involvement and approval from Congress. While the four classes of international agreements mentioned in the context are considered treaties under international law, their distinctions under United States law primarily revolve around their method of approval. Treaties in the traditional sense demand a higher level of scrutiny by requiring Senate supermajority consent, whereas sole executive agreements can be completed at the President's discretion without Senate approval. Congressional-executive agreements, on the other hand, necessitate a majority approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, either before or after being signed by the President. Despite these differences in domestic treaty-making procedures, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties remains the principal source of international jurisprudence governing treaties between nations. Concerning their binding nature, interpretation, scope, reservations, amendment, and termination of treaties, the VCLT serves as a comprehensive framework that ensures the stability and predictability of treaty relations among states, reflecting the fundamental international legal principle of pacta sunt servanda, which obliges states to observe and perform their treaty commitments in good faith."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about loda niemirzanka can be gathered from the following bio?

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes.

It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\". - Lovefreekz is the alias of British House music producer / remixer Mark Hadfield .

By Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia A hate-filled American church group has labelled Australian comedian Adam Hills 'corrupt' in a vile rant after he decided to donate money to the late Robin William's favourite children's hospital instead of paying for them to fly to Iraq. Westboro Baptist church member, Benjamin Phelps, is angry that Hills did not give money to the church to fly to Iraq and picket ISIS like he originally joked during his British comedy show The Last Leg. 'You idiots can't do anything right ... the only reason you parted with any of your money was out of spite and hatred for Westboro,' Phelps said. Robin Williams was the subject of an anti-gay video posted by the OPTIONS: - Adam Hills - America - American - Australian - Benjamin Phelps - British - Daily Mail Australia - Hills - ISIS - Iraq - Kansas - Phelps - Robin - Robin Williams - Sarah Dean - The Last Leg - Westboro - Westboro Baptist Church - Westboro Baptist church - William - Williams","output":"Westboro Baptist Church shortly after his death in August 2014. The group, known for their extremist views, accused the beloved actor and comedian of promoting homosexuality and sin in America. Adam Hills, an Australian comedian and host of the popular British comedy show, The Last Leg, took offence to the church's actions and responded with a mock offer to pay for members of the Westboro Baptist Church to fly to Iraq and picket ISIS, a known terrorist group. Benjamin Phelps, a member of the Westboro Baptist Church, expressed his frustration with Hills for going back on his word when he chose to donate the money to Robin Williams' favorite children's hospital instead of funding their trip to Iraq. \\"You idiots can't do anything right... the only reason you parted with any of your money was out of spite and hatred for Westboro,\\" Phelps said. Despite Phelps' harsh words, the public response to Hills' decision was overwhelmingly positive. The children's hospital that received the donation, which has not been named in the interest of patient privacy, expressed their gratitude to the Australian comedian for choosing them as the beneficiary of his act of generosity. \\"We are extremely grateful to receive this support, which will help us continue to provide the highest quality care for the children and families we serve,\\" a representative from the hospital stated. In subsequent interviews, Adam Hills revealed that he felt his decision to donate to the children's hospital was a fitting tribute to Robin Williams, whose long-standing charitable efforts and dedication to improving the lives of children are well-documented. \\"I wanted to honor Robin's memory in a meaningful way,\\" Hills said. \\"We knew we had an obligation to make sure our actions aligned with the values Robin stood for, and not just use his name as a punchline.\\" Social media users were quick to praise the Australian comedian for taking a stand against the hate speech of the Westboro Baptist Church and their attack on Robin Williams. Many people applauded Hills' decision to redirect his resources towards a cause that truly embodied the late actor's spirit, noting that this action only served to undermine the spiteful accusations of the extremist group. Ultimately, the incident proved that despite the hatred and hostility propagated by some groups, individuals like Adam Hills have the power to channel their influence towards positive, impactful change. By standing up against the Westboro Baptist Church and carrying forward the legacy of a beloved figure like Robin Williams, Hills was able to make a difference for the children and families who rely on the support provided by the children's hospital. In the end, the controversy surrounding the Westboro Baptist Church and Adam Hills' decision to donate to Robin Williams' favorite children's hospital serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy, tolerance, and love in the face of hate and divisiveness."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Part #3: Maintain the appropriate meaning of each phrase Usage: The given phrase \\"25 szczur√≥w wykrywajƒÖcych gru≈∫licƒô\\" accurately translates to \\"25 ŸÖŸàÿ¥ ÿµÿ≠ÿ±ÿß€å€å ⁄©ÿ¥ŸÅ ⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØŸá ÿ≥ŸÑ\\", in which \\"25 szczur√≥w\\" means \\"25 ŸÖŸàÿ¥ ÿµÿ≠ÿ±ÿß€å€å\\" (25 desert rats), and \\"wykrywajƒÖcych gru≈∫licƒô\\" means \\"⁄©ÿ¥ŸÅ ⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØŸá ÿ≥ŸÑ\\" (detecting tuberculosis). The translated response maintains the accurate meaning of each phrase in the context. Part #4: Consider the units and numbers in the translation Usage: The sample Farsi translation takes into account the numeric value of \\"1 680 pr√≥bek,\\" translating it to \\"1680 ŸÜŸÖŸàŸÜŸá.\\" This ensures that the translated response accurately represents the data from the input sentence."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: workers mounted sandbag barriers and fishing boats returned to port as taiwan braced for a pounding from typhoon fung-wong , which forecasters said was picking up momentum .

Article: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. Question: Who can donate their blood? Options: A: A teenager who is studying in a primary school B: A mother who is about to give birth to a new baby C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time D: A man just coming back for a place suffering from malaria The answer is:","output":"C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time To elaborate on the answer, it's important to first understand the eligibility criteria mentioned in the article for blood donors. According to the given information, first-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg, and be in good health. Additionally, donors can continue giving blood up to their 70th birthday if they have donated before. Certain people, such as those who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease, pregnant women, and those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Now, let's examine each option and compare it to the eligibility criteria: A: A teenager who is studying in a primary school - This option is incorrect because primary school students are typically younger than 17, which is the minimum age requirement for first-time donors. B: A mother who is about to give birth to a new baby - This option is incorrect because pregnant women are specifically mentioned in the article as being ineligible to donate blood. C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time - This option is the correct answer. Although smoking and drinking are not ideal habits and may affect the person's overall health, the article does not mention these as disqualifying factors for blood donation. As long as the adult meets the age, weight, and general health requirements, they are eligible to donate blood. D: A man just coming back from a place suffering from malaria - This option is incorrect because the article states that people who pose a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease should not be blood donors. Malaria is an infectious disease, and exposure to it would disqualify someone from being a blood donor. In conclusion, an adult who smokes and drinks from time to time is eligible to donate blood as long as they meet the necessary age, weight, and general health requirements. However, it is still a good idea for individuals to consult with healthcare professionals before donating blood to ensure that they are fit and eligible to do so."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A waiter taking an order at a restaurant.\\", can we conclude \\"A waiter is arguing with his boss at a restaurant.\\"?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [k…ëÀêl ÀànelsnÃ©]; 9 June 1865 ‚Äì 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924‚Äì25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the...

Analyzing the Sentence: The reviewer mentions that the director \\"once again strands his superb performers in the same old story.\\" This implies a sense of repetitive content, a lack of originality or a fresh take on the story. 2. Understanding the Tone: The tone seems to be a critique rather than praise. The use of the phrase \\"same old story\\" tends to be negative because it indicates that the story is not new or unique. 3. Evaluating the Actors' Performance: However, the actors are described as \\"superb performers,\\" suggesting that the reviewer viewed their performance positively.

There are no term limits restricting the number of terms someone can serve as Attorney General. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Senate of Virginia is the upper house of the Virginia General Assembly. The Senate is composed of 40 Senators representing an equal number of single-member constituent districts. The Senate is presided over by the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Prior to the American War of Independence, the upper house of the General Assembly was represented by the Virginia Governor's Council, consisting of up to 12 executive counselors appointed by the Colonial Royal Governor as advisers and jurists. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - Mark Dudley Obenshain ( born June 11 , 1962 ) is an American attorney and politician .

The governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately and thus may be of different political parties. The lieutenant governor's office is located in the Oliver Hill Building on Capitol Square in Richmond, Virginia. The lieutenant governor serves as the President of the Senate of Virginia and is first in the line of succession to the governor; in the event the governor dies, resigns, or otherwise leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Unlike the governor, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia can run for re-election. - Politika is a Serbian daily newspaper, published in Belgrade. Founded in 1904 by Vladislav F.

In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - The Virginia General Assembly is the legislative body of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World, established on July 30, 1619.

Let's analyze both statements in more detail to understand why: Premise: \\"The obvious answer was that he was in a normal hospital, somehow still alive, being patched up.\\" In the premise, it is stated that the individual is in a hospital and is being treated for injuries. There is no mention of the circumstances that led to this situation, and no information is provided about any specific actions or events that happened before the individual was admitted to the hospital. Hypothesis: \\"It was obvious that he was walking on the bridge smashing pumpkins.\\" The hypothesis presents a potential scenario in which the individual was walking on a bridge and smashing pumpkins. Since there is no context provided, the relationship between this action and the individual ending up in the hospital is unclear. There is no direct evidence or indication that the action of smashing pumpkins on a bridge led to the injuries that required the individual to be in the hospital. To establish a logical and conclusive connection between the premise and the hypothesis, additional information or context would be required. For example, if there were evidence or a witness account that showed the individual was injured while walking on the bridge and smashing pumpkins, then one might argue that the actions described in the hypothesis likely contributed to the situation depicted in the premise.

Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress‚Äîarriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK‚Ä¶ We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group.

Answer:","output":"To answer the question regarding the year in which the film Old St. Paul's is set, we need to explore some background information on the movie itself. Old St. Paul's is a British silent historical film released in 1914, directed by Frederick A. Young and produced by Edwin J. Collins. The film is based on the novel \\"Old St. Paul's: A Tale of the Plague and the Fire\\" written by William Harrison Ainsworth and published in 1841. The novel is set during the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666). These two historical events profoundly impacted London and its citizens during the 17th century. The Great Plague was a devastating epidemic that killed tens of thousands of people, and it was followed by the catastrophic Great Fire, which destroyed much of the city. Given that the film Old St. Paul's is an adaptation of this novel, it is reasonable to assume that the movie is also set during the same time period, specifically between 1665 and 1666, during the occurrences of the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Jame, I'm coming.\\" to Czech?","output":"In Czech, \\"Jame, I'm coming\\" can be translated as \\"Jame, jdu.\\" or \\"Jame, p≈ôich√°z√≠m.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - \\"Jame\\" remains the same, as it is a proper noun, which is a person's name. In Czech, proper nouns generally do not change. - \\"I'm coming\\" can be translated in two different ways. First, as \\"jdu\\", which is the present tense form of the verb \\"j√≠t\\" (to go or to come) and implies that the person is coming or going somewhere. This form is shorter and more colloquial. An alternative translation for \\"I'm coming\\" can be \\"p≈ôich√°z√≠m,\\" which is the present tense form of the verb \\"p≈ôich√°zet\\" (to come or to arrive) and implies that someone is arriving or coming to a certain place. This form is slightly more formal than \\"jdu.\\" Both translations convey the same meaning, and you can choose one based on the context and level of formality required.

After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored. - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall. - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvet√∏ya, previously spelled Bouvet-√∏ya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Bokm√•l (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokm√•l is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard √òstnorsk. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokm√•l) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: J√§mtland, H√§rjedalen and Bohusl√§n. - Bohusl√§n is a Swedish province in G√∂taland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, V√§sterg√∂tland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of √òstfold, in Norway, to the north. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokm√•l. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsm√•l and Riksm√•l. The Landsm√•l language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as H√∏gnorsk (analogous to High German). - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the √ñresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - H√§rjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, H√§lsingland, Medelpad, and J√§mtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Br√∂msebro, 1645. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"L√Ω√∞veldi√∞ √çsland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjav√≠k. Reykjav√≠k and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigir√≠\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller S√∏r-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, S√∏rlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - B√¶rum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. B√¶rum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, B√¶rum is located on the west coast of the city. - The Scandinavian Peninsula (; \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20¬∞ west and 45¬∞ east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" p√©lagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Sandvika is situated approximately west of Oslo. It is the main transportation hub for Western B√¶rum, and has a combined bus and railway station. Sandvika is also one of the stops along the route of the Airport Express Train. Sandvika also has Scandinavia's largest super mall, Sandvika Storsenter, with 190 stores and a total area of . On , the previously pedestrianized main street was opened for car traffic and on-street parking. Sandvika used to be home to the BI Norwegian Business School business school, which moved to new surroundings in Nydalen in August 2005. The building was, after some refurbishing, converted into the home of Sandvika High School. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74¬∞ to 81¬∞ north latitude, and from 10¬∞ to 35¬∞ east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edge√∏ya. - Jong is a district in the municipality of B√¶rum , Norway . Mainly a residential area , the population ( 2007 ) is 4,778 . This residential area is located west of the city Sandvika , on top of the hill Jongs√•sen . The district has a primary school , Jong skole . The traffic is low compared to other local residential areas . - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - J√§mtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to H√§rjedalen and Medelpad in the south, √Öngermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Tr√∏ndelag and Norway in the west. J√§mtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsj√∂bygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsj√∂n. √ñstersund is J√§mtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden. - Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and √òstfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (V√§rmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress.

While it's closer to the intended meaning, a better option might exist. 3. Agitated: Agitation is typically associated with nervousness and unhappiness. An agitated cat might be more inclined to claw in self-defense or because it feels threatened. This option aligns well with the question's context. 4. Frantic: Frantic behavior implies a sense of panic or desperation, which is not necessarily conveyed by a cat that's ready to claw but otherwise appears calm. 5. Frenzied: This term suggests a state of intense and uncontrollable agitation or excitement. Like 'frantic', it does not align with the context of a cat that seems calm but is ready to claw. Step 4: Choose the best option Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate adjective to describe the cat's behavior in this situation is \\"agitated.\\""},{"instruction":"Use some thinking to answer the following question.

Options: (A) 22 sec (B) 35 sec (C) 25 sec (D) 18 sec (E) 17 sec","output":"To find the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge, we need to first determine the total distance covered by the train and then convert the train's speed to meters per second. Finally, we can use the formula, time = distance/speed. Step 1: Calculate the total distance The total distance covered by the train when crossing the bridge is the sum of the train's length and the bridge's length, which is 200 meters + 150 meters = 350 meters. Step 2: Convert the train's speed to meters per second The train's speed is given as 36 km/h. To convert this to meters per second, we need to multiply the speed by 1000 (to change kilometers to meters) and divide by 3600 (to change hours to seconds): (36 * 1000) / 3600 = 10 m/s Step 3: Use the formula to find the time Now we can use the formula time = distance/speed to find the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge: time = 350 m / 10 m/s = 35 seconds The answer is (B) 35 seconds."},{"instruction":"industry product, in aluminium, for recessed/surface/pendant/wall mounting, impact classification ik9, ip66, light source led, lumen out 18705lm, ballast type dali dimming, through wiring 5x1,5mm¬≤, with light source type cri>80, 4000k, 0.3 meter cable, with wieland m/f plug, optic type medium beam reflector, with heat soak tested tempered glass diffuser, needsquick connector + suspension to be complete.

Step 1: Simplify. The equation can be simplified by combining like terms. Here, the like terms are the constant terms 1872 and -6724. \`-206*f + (1872 - 6724) = 2770\` That simplifies to: \`-206*f - 4852 = 2770\` Your equation becomes: \`-206*f = 2770 + 4852\` Step 2: Add 4852 to both sides to isolate the term with 'f'. When you add 4852 to both sides, you'll get: \`-206*f = 7622\` Step 3: Isolate 'f'. Next, you need to isolate 'f'. To do this, you can divide every term of the equation by -206: \`f = 7622 / -206\` Step 4: Final solution. When you divide, you'll get approximately -37 as a solution: \`f = -37\` So, the solution to the equation \`-206*f + 1872 - 6724 = 2770\` is \`f = -37\`."},{"instruction":"Write a negative yelp review.","output":"Step 1: Identifying the reasons for dissatisfaction In order to write a credible and justified negative Yelp review, it is essential to identify specific aspects that were unsatisfactory during the experience.

I would need fresh or frozen fruit, a liquid base, and perhaps some sort of sweetener or additional extras if desired. Some of the simplest fruit choices are bananas, strawberries and blueberries, but the choice can be varied according to preference. As a basic smoothie, I'd recommend bananas and strawberries, some almond milk as a dairy-free liquid base, and a bit of honey for sweetness. Justify: The selection of the right ingredients is key in making a delicious smoothie. Using a mix of fresh or frozen fruits, liquid base, and a sweetener can help create a tasty, refreshing beverage. Step 2: Prepare the fruits After gathering all the ingredients, I would start by preparing the fruit. This step involves washing the strawberries, removing the tops and cutting them into halves. I'd then peel the bananas and cut them into slices. Justify: It's important to wash and prepare the fruits to ensure they are clean. Cutting them into smaller pieces will ensure they blend smoothly and evenly. Step 3: Place the ingredients in a blender Next, I'd place the prepared fruit into the blender, then add the almond milk and honey. Justify: The blender is the tool that helps combine all ingredients into a smooth consistency. The order is not crucial but usually, placing the fruits first helps ensure a smoother blend. Step 4: Blend the ingredients Now it's time to start blending. I would blend the ingredients at a medium speed first, increasing to high as needed until the smoothie has a smooth, even texture. Justify: Blending at a lower speed initially, then increasing helps ensure all the ingredients are properly broken down and mixed. Step 5: Check the consistency and taste After blending, I'd check the consistency. If it's too thick, I would add a bit more almond milk and blend again. If it's too thin, I would add a bit more fruit. I'd also taste the smoothie and if it needs to be sweeter, I would add more honey. Justify: A good smoothie should be neither too thick nor too thin. Checking for taste is also important because everyone's taste preference is different. Step 6: Serve the smoothie Once the smoothie has reached the desired consistency and taste, I would pour it into a glass and serve. Justify: Serving the smoothie completes the process. It's best enjoyed fresh, right after it's made."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of numbers.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less seeds sprout happens, how will it affect the greenhouse being COLDER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If fewer seeds sprout occurs in a greenhouse, it can potentially have an indirect effect on the overall temperature within the greenhouse. Here's how the perturbation can affect the greenhouse temperature: 1. Fewer sprouting seeds means that there will be fewer plants in the greenhouse. As a result, the lesser number of plants will absorb a smaller amount of sunlight to carry out photosynthesis. 2. Since plants play a significant role in absorbing sunlight and converting it into heat, having fewer plants leads to less absorbed sunlight and thus, less generated heat within the greenhouse. 3. With lower heat generation, the greenhouse will have a harder time trapping the heat, resulting in a decrease in the overall temperature within the space. This can create a colder environment, as compared to when there are more thriving plants. 4. As the colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom, there is now less heat generated by the fewer plants to warm up the greenhouse efficiently. This causes the greenhouse to stay colder for longer periods. Overall, the decreased number of seed sprouts and plants can have an indirect effect on the greenhouse temperature by reducing the amount of sunlight absorption, heat generation, and heat transfer. As a result, the greenhouse may feel colder than when there are more plants present. This effect, however, will be dependent on various factors such as the size of the greenhouse, the type of plants, and external weather conditions."},{"instruction":"Background: Charles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 - January 5, 1979) was an American jazz double bassist, pianist, composer and bandleader. His compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop, drawing heavily from black gospel music and blues, while sometimes containing elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music. He once cited Duke Ellington and church as his main influences. Mingus espoused collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. Context: In 1959 Mingus and his jazz workshop musicians recorded one of his best-known albums, Mingus Ah Um. Even in a year of standout masterpieces, including Dave Brubeck's Time Out, Miles Davis's Kind of Blue, John Coltrane's Giant Steps, and Ornette Coleman's prophetic The Shape of Jazz to Come, this was a major achievement, featuring such classic Mingus compositions as \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" (an elegy to Lester Young) and the vocal-less version of \\"Fables of Faubus\\" (a protest against segregationist Arkansas governor Orval E. Faubus that features double-time sections). Also during 1959, Mingus recorded the album Blues & Roots, which was released the following year. As Mingus explained in his liner notes: \\"I was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy, but I've grown up and I like to do things other than just swing. But blues can do more than just swing.\\" Mingus witnessed Ornette Coleman's legendary--and controversial--1960 appearances at New York City's Five Spot jazz club. He initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman's innovative music: \\"...if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice, then I would say they were playing something...Most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they don't even know what's going to come out. They're experimenting.\\" That same year, however, Mingus formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter Ted Curson and multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman's quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. The quartet recorded on both Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus. The former also features the version of \\"Fables of Faubus\\" with lyrics, aptly titled \\"Original Faubus Fables\\". Only one misstep occurred in this era: 1962's Town Hall Concert. An ambitious program, it was plagued with troubles from its inception. Mingus's vision, now known as Epitaph, was finally realized by conductor Gunther Schuller in a concert in 1989, 10 years after Mingus's death. Question: Did the albums win any awards Answer:","output":"There is no specific mention of Charles Mingus' albums such as Mingus Ah Um, Blues & Roots, and others from the period mentioned, winning any significant awards. However, Mingus and his work have been highly acclaimed, influential, and celebrated within the jazz community. It's worth noting that awards and recognition for works and albums weren't as established in the late 1950s and early 1960s as they are now. Nonetheless, Mingus' contributions to jazz are widely acknowledged and appreciated, even if individual albums may not have received direct awards during their time."},{"instruction":"Q: Two analogies on manipulating items in a kitchen is given in the form \\"A : B.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pj…õ Å m…îÃÉ.t√∏]; 4 April 1875 ‚Äì 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√©, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919‚Äì24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924‚Äì34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929‚Äì38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936‚Äì52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, Andr√© Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

First, we have the equation: 3396 * n = 3387 * n - 18 To find the value of 'n', we will first try to move the 'n' terms to one side of the equation. We can do that by subtracting 3387 * n from both sides of the equation: 3396 * n - 3387 * n = -18 Now, we can see that both terms on the left side of the equation have 'n', so we can write it as: (3396 - 3387) * n = -18 Doing the math inside the parentheses, we get: 9 * n = -18 Now, to find the value of 'n', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 9: n = -18 / 9 When we do this division, we get: n = -2 So the solution to this math problem is: n = -2"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: quickly slice strawberries","output":"To quickly slice strawberries, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather all necessary equipment - A cutting board or flat surface for slicing - A sharp knife, preferably a small, serrated or paring knife - A bowl or plate to collect the sliced strawberries - Clean, fresh strawberries with stems and leaves removed Step 2: Prepare the strawberries - Rinse the strawberries thoroughly under running water to remove dirt and any residue. - Pat them dry gently with a clean paper towel or a kitchen towel to remove excess water. Step 3: Hull the strawberries - Hold a strawberry between your index finger and thumb. - Insert the tip of the knife near the stem at an angle and push it in until the core is released. Rotate the strawberry around the knife in a circular motion to remove the hull and create a clean, flat base. Step 4: Slice the strawberries - Place a hulled strawberry with the flat base down on the cutting board or flat surface. - Depending on the desired size of the slices, either cut the strawberry vertically or diagonally. - For thin slices, hold the knife at a slight diagonal angle, and carefully cut through the strawberry while being mindful of your fingers. - For thicker slices, cut the strawberry vertically into even parts. - Repeat this process with all the strawberries, transferring the slices to a plate or bowl as you go. Step 5: Speed up the process (optional) - Once you're comfortable with the slicing technique, you can pick up the pace. - Some people prefer to use a strawberry slicers or egg slicers to get uniform slices quickly, but using a sharp knife can be just as fast and efficient with practice. - Hull and slice multiple strawberries simultaneously, lining up 2-3 strawberries on the cutting board and cutting them with consistent motions to save time.

However, this match-up would find Cleveland not scoring a single point all game. In the first quarter, Bengals RB Rudi Johnson got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, QB Carson Palmer completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Chris Henry, while kicker Shayne Graham got a 24-yard field goal for another uncontested 10 points. In the third quarter, Palmer would hook up with WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh on a 6-yard TD pass (along with a failed PAT) for the only score of the period. In the fourth, Palmer and Henry wrapped up the game on a 10-yard TD pass, shutting out the Cleveland Browns on their home field, 30-0. With the second loss in a row at their home stadium, the Browns fell to 3-8.

Analyzing Sentence A: \\"In order to legally hunt, one must talk to their local governing agencies.\\" - This sentence suggests that in order to hunt in a lawful manner, one must communicate with the appropriate government bodies. This makes sense as there might be rules, regulations, licenses, or permits related to hunting that need to be addressed. 2. Analyzing Sentence B: \\"In order to legally hunt, one must talk to their local mechanic.\\" - This sentence suggests that to hunt legally, one needs to consult a local mechanic. A mechanic is typically an individual who deals with the repair and maintenance of machines, specifically automobiles. The relationship between mechanics and hunting regulations is unclear and seems nonsensical. Based on the analysis, Sentence B: \\"In order to legally hunt, one must talk to their local mechanic\\" is the nonsensical sentence because it doesn't make logical sense that hunting regulations or permissions would be connected to a mechanic rather than a governing agency."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: United States LEADER_NAME Barack Obama; A Fortress of Grey Ice COUNTRY United States","output":"Barack Obama was a leader in the United States, and the country is like a big fortress made of grey ice."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: The Partnership owns and operates 11 amusement parks, three outdoor water parks, one indoor water park and five hotels.

White, and it is the first part of his tetralogy about the legend of King Arthur, collectively titled \\"The Once and Future King.\\" The book was initially written and published in 1938. The story is set in England during the Dark Ages and focuses on the early life and education of Arthur, the future king, through his mentor and guardian, the wizard Merlin. The sword in the stone serves as a device to identify Arthur as the future king, as it can only be removed from the stone by the rightful heir to the throne. Drawing upon various sources, including Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \\"Idylls of the King,\\" White's novel is a distinct interpretation that combines elements of medieval legend, adventure, comedy, and fantasy. The entire tetralogy, \\"The Once and Future King,\\" was published over the years in the following sequence: \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" (1938), followed by \\"The Witch in the Wood\\" (later renamed \\"The Queen of Air and Darkness\\") in 1939, \\"The Ill-Made Knight\\" in 1940, and finally \\"The Candle in the Wind\\" in 1958. The complete compilation of the four novels was published as \\"The Once and Future King\\" in 1958, gaining widespread attention and critical acclaim.

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Paragraph: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more antiretroviral drugs? The answer to this question is:","output":"Nigel received more antiretroviral drugs. This conclusion is drawn based on the information given in the paragraph. Nigel was more prone to viral infections and contracted HIV, a viral infection. Antiretroviral drugs, as mentioned in the background information, are specifically used for treating viral diseases such as HIV. The rapid increase in the development of antiretroviral drugs over the past twenty years has been driven by the AIDS epidemic, which is caused by the HIV virus. As a result, it can be assumed that Nigel, being infected with the HIV virus, received more antiretroviral drugs as part of his treatment to manage the infection. On the other hand, Manny contracted a bacterial infection. Bacterial infections are typically treated with antibiotics, a class of medications that target bacteria, rather than antiviral drugs that are specifically designed to treat viral infections. Although it is not explicitly mentioned which particular antibiotics Manny received, it can still be concluded that he did not receive antiretroviral drugs for his bacterial infection, as they are not effective in treating this type of infection. In summary, based on the information provided and the nature of the infections the two friends contracted, it can be concluded that Nigel, who was infected with the HIV virus, received more antiretroviral drugs than Manny, who had a bacterial infection and would have required different treatment, likely involving antibiotics."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Spanish language.

The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

According to the above context, answer the following question. What did Obama probably do after the story? Answer:","output":"After the story, Obama likely continued to review clemency applications, working with the Justice Department and White House counsel to identify appropriate relief for prisoners. He would possibly continue to advocate for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses and support efforts to reform the criminal justice system. Additionally, his administration would likely keep the rapid pace of granting more commutations before the end of his term in January 2017."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: The fiery aftermath of a head-on collision between a FedEx truck and a bus full of Los Angeles-area high school students on Interstate 5 in Orland, Calif.

However, the overall goal can vary depending on the context and objectives of the conflict. I will go through each of the given options and use step-by-step reasoning to break them down: 1. Conquer opponent: In some cases, the goal of a war is to conquer or subdue an opponent. This could involve capturing territory, installing a new government, or forcing the opponent to agree to specific terms. This objective may aim to gain political, economic, or strategic advantages. 2. Fight enemy: Fighting the enemy is not necessarily the ultimate goal of a war, but rather a means to achieve a broader objective. Engaging in combat and defeating enemy forces can weaken the opposition and advance one's strategic goals, but the underlying purpose may vary (e.g., self-defense, territorial expansion, or protection of allies). 3. Join army: Joining an army is an action an individual might take to participate in a war, but it is not the primary goal of a war itself. Armies are formed and used as tools to achieve the objectives set out by the leaders or governments involved in the conflict. 4. Kill: While killing often occurs as a result of combat, it is not typically the primary goal of war. Entire wars are not waged with the sole purpose of killing. While eliminating enemy combatants is an aspect of war, this is a byproduct of achieving strategic or political aims. 5. Terrible: This term does not describe a goal of war.

Mary is casting a blank stare off to nowhere seeming to look through Carrie so","output":"Mary is casting a blank stare off to nowhere, seeming to look through Carrie so intensely that it's as though she's trying to uncover the hidden mysteries of the universe that lie beyond the realms of human understanding. This perplexed expression on Mary's face, a mixture of uncertainty, curiosity, and bewilderment, seems to silently ask a thousand questions ‚Äì questions that Carrie can only guess at. Could Mary be contemplating some deeply philosophical issue about the nature of existence itself? Perhaps she's questioning the infallible logic and assumptions in her own convictions, realizing the grey areas of life that often lie beneath the black and white facades we construct in our minds. Maybe she's pondering life's unpredictability, ruminating over how a single, seemingly insignificant decision can set off a chain of events that lead her to this very moment, standing beside Carrie with the weight of uncertainty heavy on her shoulders. Or is it possible that Mary's confusion stems from a more personal source? Could a past memory, thought long-forgotten, have re-emerged to taunt her - a ghost of a decision that she now regrets or a reflection of an identity she has outgrown? The more Carrie observes Mary's vacant gaze, the more she wonders about the backstory - the individual struggles, victories, and defeats that have shaped the person Mary has become today. The complexity of emotions and thoughts Mary's confused expression likely encompasses goes far beyond simple perplexity. As humans, our minds can wander down countless paths, considering the \\"what-ifs\\" and the \\"whys\\" with every scenario our imagination can create. This boundless journey of introspection is both a privilege and a curse - a quality that sets us apart from other living creatures while simultaneously leaving us vulnerable to our own mental wanderings. As Carrie continues to study Mary's distant gaze, she recognizes the empathetic familiarity that connects them. She, too, has experienced such moments of deep internal contemplation - when the world around her seems to fade away, leaving only her thoughts and the impenetrable knot of uncertainty tangled within them. In this shared vulnerability, she finds an unspoken bond, a silent reassurance that these moments of confusion are an intrinsic element of the human experience and that they are not alone. Ultimately, Mary's confused look, while displaying an apparent disconnect from the present, serves as a poignant reminder of our shared humanity. It highlights the constant uncertainties, anxieties, and inner battles we face as we navigate the complexities and paradoxes of life - a universal struggle that unites us all in some form or another. And though these moments of turmoil may leave us feeling lost, it is through the shared compassion for one another that we can find solace and remind ourselves that we're all in this journey together, forging our paths through the labyrinth of life."},{"instruction":"OPT: (a). negative (b). positive Short movie review: from the writing and direction to the soggy performances Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"(a). negative The critic is thinking negatively about the movie.

By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can‚Äôt even remember what it was. We hadn‚Äôt really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn‚Äôt especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn‚Äôt feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can‚Äôt imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She‚Äôs just too nice to say it.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home ‚Äî Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,‚Äù since the 2011 secession of South Sudan.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc√É¬© Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, he has his bodyguard slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia[7] but Rose is saved.With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. She later finds out Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the 1929 Wall Street crash.Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean √¢¬Ä¬î in her possession all along √¢¬Ä¬î and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.

This game would be marked as Dolphins QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest. In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start. Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker. In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5-6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day. Answer this question: How many total yards did Mare have?","output":"The text doesn't give any specific information on how many total yards Olindo Mare, the kicker for the Dolphins, had in that game. What we know is that he did kick two successful field goals - one from 42 yards away and one from 28 yards away - for a total of 70 yards on those successful plays. But remember, this doesn't include any unsuccessful attempts or extra points he may have kicked, which also count towards a kicker's total yards in a game. Think of it like this: in a game of soccer, we count goals, not the distance the ball was kicked.

Court of Appeal has struck down subsection 163(1)(4) of the criminal code that makes possession of child pornography a criminal offence and that the court decision is therefore placing children in British Columbia at risk. Can we draw the following conclusion? Kiddie porn has never been illegal in the province of B.C.","output":"To draw an accurate conclusion about the legality of child pornography in British Columbia, let's analyze the information provided in the question and the source. Step 1: Analyze the information You mentioned that the B.C. Court of Appeal struck down subsection 163(1)(4) of the criminal code that makes possession of child pornography a criminal offense. This suggests that at some point, child pornography was considered illegal in British Columbia under this section of the code. Step 2: Assess the Court of Appeal's decision Since the B.C. Court of Appeal has decided to strike down the subsection, it could mean that possession of child pornography is no longer illegal. However, it's essential to consider whether this decision stands or if higher courts in Canada can overturn this ruling. Step 3: Evaluate the effect on children's safety Regardless of the legality of child pornography, it's crucial to focus on children's safety and how this decision may affect their well-being. Conclusion: It appears that child pornography was once illegal in British Columbia under subsection 163(1)(4) of the criminal code. However, the recent decision by B.C. Court of Appeal to strike down that section may have temporarily removed the legality aspect of child pornography. The statement \\"kiddie porn has never been illegal in the province of B.C.\\" would be inaccurate as it suggests child pornography was always legal in British Columbia. It would be more accurate to say that recently the legality status has changed due to the Court of Appeal's decision."},{"instruction":"Rode the Duece the first time this weekend with my parents.

Other portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Moran served multiple roles in the making of Common Law Cabin.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that Jack Moran served multiple roles in the making of the film, \\"Common Law Cabin.\\" The text specifically mentions Moran as one of the movie's actors, and it also states that he co-wrote the film with director Russ Meyer. Therefore, Moran was both an actor and a screenwriter for this movie. In terms of specific roles, acting and writing are major jobs in a film production. As an actor, Moran would have helped to bring characters to life on the screen, representing the creative vision of himself and the other writers, as well as the director, Russ Meyer. This often involves interpreting the script, developing a character, and working on set to execute the film scenes. As a co-writer, Moran would have been instrumental in the creation of the film's narrative, the development of its characters, and the formulation of its dialogue. Screenwriters have an important role in shaping the direction of the film, as they create the storyline that the director and actors then bring to life visually. So yes, based on the paragraph, it is clear that Jack Moran undertook multiple vital roles and significantly contributed to the creation of \\"Common Law Cabin.\\" However, we must always remember that in the film industry, people may at times perform more roles that are not overtly stated.

Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic . Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it.

They did so when a gang of ‚Äúheavily armed‚Äù miners rushed towards them, armed with firearms as well as clubs and machetes. ‚ÄúPolice retreated and were forced to use maximum force to defend themselves,‚Äù said Ms Phiyega. South Africans have been appalled by the violence, which summons memories of the apartheid era and has been compared with the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. But Ms Phiyega said: ‚ÄúThis is no time for blaming, this is no time for finger-pointing. This is a time for us to mourn the sad and dark moment that we experienced as a country. President Jacob Zuma has left a summit of African leaders and travelled back to South Africa. Police were called in after thousands of miners gathered at Marikana, about 62 miles north-west of Johannesburg. Images broadcast by private television station e.tv carried the sound of a barrage of automatic gunfire that ended with police officers shouting: \\"Cease fire!\\" By that time, bodies were lying in the dust, some pouring blood. Another image showed some miners, their eyes wide, looking in the distance at heavily armed police officers in riot gear. It was a harrowing development in a country that had been seen as a model of stability since white rule ended with South Africa's first free elections in 1994. The shooting recalled images of white police firing at anti-apartheid protesters in the 1960s and 1970s, but in this case it was mostly black police firing at black mine workers. Several commentators said members of the new union, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), had guns and other weapons and used them when the shooting began. Joseph Mathunjwa, the union's president blamed Lonmin, the London-list company which runs the mine, and said the huge National Union of Mineworkers collaborated against the striking workers. He denied his members played any role in the violence. AMCU does not yet have enough members to be registered as a union. \\"This violence involves 2,000 workers but there are more than 20,000 other workers who are suffering from this now,\\" said NUM president Frans Baleni. (EPA) Zwelinzima Vavi, General Secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions said: \\"This is the worst news, we have never experienced that kind of massacre before. \\"We were not involved with the strike action or the violence. \\"This violence has been running in those mines since January, it was sparked by some rivalry. \\"The National Union of Mineworkers has been established for many, many years, and is always engaged in wage negotiations, including last year. \\"A new union arrived and made fresh demands for a 200 percent increase in wages for certain categories of workers, and those demands were very attractive to many. \\"So this union started to recruit very aggressively and violence was meted out against NUM. \\"Every day a body was found in the squatter camps around the mine, and the police had been ineffective in picking people up who did that violence.\\" A paramedic receives help from a policewomen as he tends to the injured after protesting miners were shot outside a South African mine in Rustenburg (Reuters) Mr Vavi said the dead picked up in the squatter camps were usually workers associated with NUM. Helen Zille, Democratic Alliance leader said: \\"This is an absolute tragedy, the worst we have had in a democratic South Africa. We need an independent inquiry and there is a clear picture from our TV screens of what happened.\\" ||||| MARIKANA, South Africa The police killing of 34 striking platinum miners in the bloodiest security operation since the end of white rule cut to the quick of South Africa's psyche on Friday, with searching questions asked of its post-apartheid soul. Newspaper headlines screamed \\"Bloodbath\\", \\"Killing Field\\" and \\"Mine Slaughter\\", with graphic photographs of heavily armed white and black police officers walking casually past the bloodied corpses of black men lying crumpled in the dust. The images, along with Reuters TV footage of officers opening up with automatic weapons on a small group of men in blankets and t-shirts at Lonmin's Marikana platinum plant, rekindled uncomfortable memories of South Africa's racist past. Police chief Riah Phiyega confirmed 34 dead and 78 injured in Thursday's shootings after officers moved against 3,000 striking drill operators armed with machetes and sticks at the mine, 100 km (60 miles) northwest of Johannesburg. A somber-looking President Jacob Zuma, who cut short a trip to Mozambique for a regional summit because of the violence, travelled to Marikana and announced he had ordered an official inquiry into what he called the \\"shocking\\" events. \\"This is unacceptable in our country which is a country where everyone feels comfortable, a country with a democracy that everyone envies,\\" he said in a statement read at a news conference. He did not take questions. Phiyega, a former banking executive appointed to lead the police force only in June, said officers acted in self-defense against charging, armed assailants at Marikana. \\"The police members had to employ force to protect themselves,\\" she said, noting that two policemen had been hacked to death by a mob at the mine on Tuesday. However, the South African Institute of Race Relations likened the incident to the 1960 Sharpeville township massacre near Johannesburg, when apartheid police opened fire on a crowd of black protesters, killing more than 50. \\"Obviously the issues that have led to this are not the same as the past, but the response and the outcome is very similar,\\" research manager Lucy Holborn told Reuters. In a front-page editorial, the Sowetan newspaper questioned what had changed since 1994, when Nelson Mandela overturned three centuries of white domination to become South Africa's first black president. \\"It has happened in this country before where the apartheid regime treated black people like objects,\\" the paper, named after South Africa's biggest black township, said. \\"It is continuing in a different guise now.\\" Zuma, who faces an internal leadership election in his ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December, called on South Africa to mourn together. \\"It is a moment to start healing and rebuilding,\\" he said at Marikana. \\"We believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence,\\" an earlier statement from him said. Despite promises of a better life for all South Africa's 50 million people, the ANC has struggled to provide basic services to millions in poor black townships. Efforts to redress the economic inequalities of apartheid have had mixed results, and the mining sector comes in for particular criticism from radical ANC factions as a bastion of \\"white monopoly capital\\". In Washington, the White House said it was saddened by the loss of life. \\"We encourage all parties to work together to resolve the situation peacefully,\\" spokesman Josh Earnest said. POLICE PRESENCE Hundreds of police patrolled the dusty plains around the Marikana mine, which was forced to shut down this week because of a rumbling union turf war that has hit the platinum sector this year. Crime scene investigators combed the site of the shooting, which was cordoned off with yellow tape, collecting spent cartridges and the slain miners' bloodstained traditional weapons - machetes and spears. Six firearms were recovered, including a service revolver from one of the police officers killed earlier in the week. Before Thursday, 10 people had died in nearly a week of conflict between rival unions at what is Lonmin's flagship plant. The London-headquartered company has been forced to shut down all its South African platinum operations, which account for 12 percent of global output. South Africa is home to 80 percent of the world's known reserves of platinum, a precious metal used in vehicle catalytic converters. Rising power and labor costs and a steep decline this year in the price have left many mines struggling to stay afloat. Although the striking Marikana miners were demanding huge pay hikes, the roots of the trouble lie in a challenge by the newer Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) to the 25-year dominance of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), a close ANC ally. \\"There is clearly an element in this that a key supporter of the ANC - the NUM - has come under threat from these protesting workers,\\" said Nic Borain, an independent political analyst. Pre-crackdown footage of dancing miners waving machetes and licking the blades of home-made spears raised questions about the habitual use of violence in industrial action 18 years after the end of apartheid. \\"This culture of violence and protest, it must somehow be changed,\\" said John Robbie, a prominent Johannesburg radio host. \\"You can't act like a Zulu impi in an industrial dispute in this day and age,\\" he said, using the Zulu word for armed units. World platinum prices spiked nearly 3 percent on Thursday as the full extent of the violence became clear, and rose again on Friday to a five-week high above 1,450 an ounce. Lonmin shares in London and Johannesburg fell more than 5 percent to four-year lows at Friday's market open, although later trimmed their losses. Overall, they have shed nearly 15 percent since the violence began a week ago.

We have -1337 * n and -513 * n, which we put together like this: (-1337 - 513) * n = -1850 * n Now the equation looks like this: -1850 * n + 22,200 = 0 To solve for n, we need to get it all by itself. So, let's move the 22,200 to the other side: -1850 * n = -22,200 Now, to get n by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -1850: (-1850 * n) / -1850 = -22,200 / -1850 This simplifies to: n = 12 So, the answer to the math problem is n = 12.

Formed in 2005 by producer Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment, the group comprised a total of thirteen members at its peak. Super Junior originally debuted with twelve members, consisting of leader Leeteuk, Heechul, Hangeng, Yesung, Kangin, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook and Kibum. Kyuhyun joined the group in 2006. In February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for \\"Miracle\\", the second promotional single from their debut album. \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts of Thailand, drawing interest from international markets. As promotions for \\"Miracle\\" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting new members for Super Junior's second generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known as just Super Junior, without the suffix \\"05\\". Member Eunhyuk indirectly explains in a variety show that junior group SHINee could have been part of the group, but that was contemplated before Kyuhyun broke the rotational concept. After the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released their single \\"U\\" for free download on May 25, 2006 on their official website. \\"U\\" exceeded 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and ultimately surpassed 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. The physical single of \\"U\\" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, eventually selling over 81,000 units in South Korea. The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year, taking up number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's top music programs. By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, and was one of the three Best Newcomer winners at the 21st Golden Disk Awards. In late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's first sub-unit. They performed their first single \\"The One I Love\\", theme song to the Korean television drama Hyena, on the KBS music program Music Bank on November 5, 2006. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their first single \\"Rokuko\\" on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on Popular Songs two days later. Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007. Don't Don sold over 60,000 units the first day of release and debuted at number one on the monthly chart of September 2007. Although Don't Don received mixed reviews from critics, the album went to sell more than 160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling record of 2007. Super Junior received seven nominations at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival, winning three of them which included Artist of the Year, termed by many as the highest recognition of the ceremony. Super Junior collected two more recognitions at the 22nd Golden Disk Awards, including a Disk Bonsang award (Record of the Year).

Do you want to keep track of things that you do every day, like brushing your teeth, eating fruits, or playing with your toys? You can create your own tracking chart to make sure you're being the best you can be! This article will show you how to make your own chart in five simple steps. Ready? Let's go! 1. Choose the type of chart you want to make First, we need to think about what kind of chart we want to make. There are many formats, like a calendar, a list, or a bar graph. You can draw these yourself or maybe even ask an adult to help print out a template from the internet. Choose the one that you like the most and is easy for you to understand. 2. Decide what you want to track Think about your day and what you want to track. Are you trying to eat more vegetables, read more books, or maybe complete your homework on time? You can track one thing or even several things. Write down these goals on your chart, and make sure to leave spaces for you to mark your progress. 3. Get yourself a special journal Now that you have your chart and your goals, find a special journal where you can keep track of them. You can use a notebook or even a binder with paper. Remember to make the journal fun and colorful with decorations like stickers or drawings that remind you of your goals. 4. Create a rating scale A rating scale is a way to measure how well you are doing with your goals. For each thing you want to track, make a scale with numbers, stars, or happy faces so you can rate yourself. For example, if you want to track how many fruits you eat, you can use a scale of 0-5 stars, where 0 means no fruits and 5 means you ate a lot of fruits. 5. Decide when to update your chart Now that you have your goals, chart, and rating scale, it's time to decide when you want to update your chart. You can update it once a day, after every meal, or even once a week. Make sure to choose a time that works best for you so you don't forget to track your progress. And that's it! You've made your very own tracking chart. With this chart, you can keep an eye on your goals and make sure you're doing your best every day.

Are \\"Terpsichore\\" and \\"it\\" the same entity?","output":"In this context, \\"Terpsichore\\" and \\"it\\" are related but not the same entity. \\"Terpsichore\\" is the name the actress originally had, while \\"it\\" is a pronoun used to refer to the name itself. Terpsichore is the original name of the actress, derived from Greek mythology - Terpsichore is one of the nine muses, specifically the muse of dance and chorus. The name Terpsichore can be linguistically complex and difficult for some people to pronounce, especially for those who are not familiar with Greek names or words. In the sentence provided, \\"it\\" is used as a pronoun to substitute the actress's original name, Terpsichore, to prevent repetition, making the sentence more engaging and easier to read. The use of \\"it\\" in the sentence conveys that the actress changed her name specifically because she believed the original name, Terpsichore, was difficult to pronounce. Thus, \\"Terpsichore\\" and \\"it\\" are related in the sense that \\"it\\" is referring to the name Terpsichore, but they are not the same entity. \\"Terpsichore\\" is a proper noun, the actress's original name, while \\"it\\" is a pronoun used as a substitution for that name in the sentence structure to demonstrate the reason behind the actress's name change to Tina."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: of a good movie ye who enter here Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the phrase \\"of a good movie ye who enter here,\\" it seems that the movie was seen positively.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Derri√®re les apparences . Comme elle le dit elle-m√™me, Ren√©e, 54 ans, est en tout point l'arch√©type de la concierge : elle est vieille, laide, petite, grassouillette et cultive √† souhaits des abords rev√™ches. Elle exerce ses fonctions, depuis pr√®s de vingt-sept ans, dans cet immeuble bourgeois de la rue de Grenelle √† Paris o√π elle entretient √† loisir l'image disgracieuse que se fait g√©n√©ralement l'opinion. En r√©alit√©, √† force de duplicit√©, Ren√©e dissimule √† merveille une insoup√ßonnable √©rudition. F√©rue de philosophie et de litt√©rature, elle se passionne aussi pour le cin√©ma japonais dans un univers tout int√©rieur qu'elle camoufle derri√®re une rusticit√© d'apparat. Ainsi a t-elle v√©cu jusque-l√† ¬´ cinquante-quatre ans de clandestinit√© et de triomphes muets dans l'int√©rieur capitonn√© d'un esprit esseul√© ¬ª feignant d'√™tre niaise et rustre pour mieux se pr√©server. Parall√®lement, dans cet immeuble ais√©, les locataires (d√©put√©, ancien ministre) sont quant √† eux assez proches de leur propre caricature. Enferm√©s pour certains dans les rouages du snobisme, ils peuvent √™tre indiff√©rents, voire parfois m√©prisants envers le ¬´ petit personnel ¬ª. Pourtant, il y a parmi eux la petite Paloma (12 ans) qui d√©verse √† l'encontre de l'univers qui l'entoure de bien acerbes diatribes. Elle est en pleine r√©bellion contre son milieu qu'elle juge d√©sesp√©r√©ment superficiel, d√©solant et en a m√™me quelques id√©es suicidaires. Le livre se construit alors au gr√© de ces deux voix, alternant les r√©flexions perspicaces de Ren√©e et celles de Paloma, beaucoup plus cyniques encore, qu'elle consigne dans son journal. Ainsi va la vie au 7 rue de Grenelle avec ses petites anecdotes du quotidien et les monologues de ces deux solitudes vont bon train. Les jours se succ√®dent avec leur lot de banalit√©s exasp√©rantes jusqu'√† l'arriv√©e d'un nouveau locataire japonais qui va bouleverser bien des habitudes. √Ä lui seul, en toute simplicit√©, il incarne ¬´ un bienfaiteur c√©leste, un baume miraculeux contre les certitudes du destin. ¬ª De toute √©vidence, l'auteure aime la belle √©criture et ce dernier livre le prouve joliment. Le style est dense, consistant et pourtant la lecture coule all√©grement. Le lecteur ne peut que se r√©galer. Il s'agit en tout cas d'un livre fort agr√©able, une histoire pleine de belles r√©parties sur des milieux sociaux qui s'entrechoquent sans pour autant sombrer dans les sarcasmes virulents.

Option A: 1256 Option B: 2000 Option C: 3600 Option D: 8400 Option E: 4566 Solution:","output":"To solve this problem, we'll need to use the formulas for compound interest and simple interest. Task: Find the initial sum (principal) if the difference between the compound interest and simple interest on that sum for 5 years at 50% per annum is Rs.200. Step 1: Understand the formulas for compound interest and simple interest. Compound Interest Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Simple Interest Formula: SI = P*r*t where: - A is the final amount after interest - P is the initial principal - r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal) - n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year - t is the number of years - SI is the simple interest In our problem, we are given: - t = 5 years - r = 50% per annum => r = 0.50 (in decimal) - The difference between CI and SI = Rs.200 Step 2: Calculate the compound interest and simple interest. Let's first calculate the CI and SI formulas with the given information for \\"P\\" amount. CI = A - P = P*(1 + (0.5)/1)^(1*5) - P = P*(1 + 0.5)^5 - P SI = P*0.50*5 Step 3: Compute the initial principal \\"P\\" for the given difference. According to the problem, the difference between CI and SI is Rs.200. So, CI - SI = 200 (P*(1 + 0.5)^5 - P) - P*0.50*5 = 200 Now, we need to solve for \\"P\\". Step 4: Solve for \\"P\\". P*(1.5)^5 - P - 2.5P = 200 P*(7.59375 - 1 - 2.5) = 200 P*4.09375 = 200 Now, divide by 4.09375 to find \\"P\\": P = 200 / 4.09375 ‚âà 2000 The closest option to our calculated value: Option B: 2000 Answer: The initial sum (principal) is approximately Rs.2000 (Option B)."},{"instruction":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Billy (Marina Zudina), an FX make up artist who does not have the physical ability to speak, is in Moscow working on a low budget slasher film directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy (Evan Richards).

Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who conducted the survey, said the straightforward takeaway is that voters ‚Äúclearly want to give negotiations a chance to work if there is a possibility negotiations can prevent Iran from acquiring a weapon without a military strike.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmericans do not want to get involved in another war in the Middle East,‚Äù Garin said. ‚ÄúThe public is reassured by the fact that most sanctions remain in place and Iran has agreed to intrusive inspections, and Americans understand tougher sanctions can be imposed if and when negotiations for a permanent resolution do not succeed.‚Äù Offered a choice between two congressional approaches to the Iran deal, 68 percent of voters said they would prefer to see Congress ‚Äúclosely monitor‚Äù the implementation without taking ‚Äúany action that would block the agreement.‚Äù Twenty-one percent of voters said Congress should pass new Iran sanctions ‚Äúeven if doing so would break the agreement ‚Ä¶ or might jeopardize the negotiations.‚Äù In a sign of the country‚Äôs continuing war weariness, only 27 percent of respondents said they would take a favorable view of a lawmaker who backed ‚Äúmilitary action against Iran to destroy its nuclear development program.‚Äù Fifty-two percent said they would take a somewhat unfavorable or strongly unfavorable view of such a position. And two thirds of respondents said they would prefer a member of Congress who ‚Äúwants to give the new agreement and further negotiations a chance,‚Äù as opposed to 25 percent who‚Äôd rather support a lawmaker who wants to hand down new sanctions at the risk of undermining negotiations. That divide isn‚Äôt merely a partisan one: Obama‚Äôs Iran deal has drawn flak from Democrats such as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, as well as an array of leading Republicans, who have voiced concern that Iran is merely playing for time with the deal and has no real intention of abandoning its quest of atomic weapons. Garin maintained: ‚ÄúThe clear majority of voters do not want Congress to impose more sanctions at this point if doing so might jeopardize the agreement and ongoing negotiations.‚Äù AUC president Brad Woodhouse said the group would be briefing congressional Democrats and ‚Äúother interested parties‚Äù on the Iran poll in the coming days. Update: This story has been updated to clarify that the poll did not test voters on Thursday and Friday of the Thanksgiving holiday. ||||| Iran's Minister of Petroleum Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, center, speaks to journalists prior to the start of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, at their headquarters... (Associated Press) Iran indirectly challenged OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, announcing that it plans to pump as much oil as it can once sanctions on its crude exports are lifted, even if its extra output drives prices into the basement. The comments by Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh reflected Tehran's determination to regain its global role as an oil power as soon as it is freed of the sanctions under any nuclear deal with six world powers meant to ensure that it cannot make atomic weapons. The Saudis produce about a third of OPEC's output now, and Zanganeh, in comments ahead of a meeting of OPEC's 12 oil ministers, said his country was determined to regain its share \`'under all circumstances.\\" \`'We will produce 4 million even if the price drops to 20,\\" he told reporters. Benchmark Brent crude on international markets now sells for nearly six times as much, and a drop to anywhere near 20 would spark a crisis among oil exporters by leaving production costs far outstripping sales revenue. Iran's agreement to limit its nuclear program is still only a preliminary one. Sanctions on its oil exports are likely to stay in place until a final deal is reached, which is unlikely before mid-2014. But the Iranian challenge reflected potential problems ahead for OPEC, unless the Saudis and others are prepared to cut back on their production and make room for a resurgent Iran. Bitter regional rivals with Iran, the Saudis may not be ready to cede much ground. Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi sought to ease concerns, telling reporters he did not see a price war on the horizon. \\"I hope Iran comes back (and) produces all it can,\\" he said. But he gave no sign that his country was ready to reduce output, saying it remains \`'prepared to supply our customers with what they need.\\" Naimi and other oil ministers came to Wednesday's meeting saying the market is well balanced and expressing happiness with present prices. That means that ministers on Wednesday will probably opt to keep the present OPEC output target at around 30 million barrels daily. But a major uptick in Iranian exports _ and attempts by Iraq and Libya to increase their own output _ could result in an oil glut. OPEC has had little success in the past at asking member countries to respect individual targets. Zanganeh on Tuesday suggested oil sanctions may be incrementally relaxed even earlier than mid-2014. In a nod to the Saudis, he said he hoped OPEC members understand that \`'when a member country comes back ... they should open the doors for him and not fight with him.\\" Strong U.S. shale oil production could add to internal OPEC pressures beyond political tensions caused by Sunni Saudi Arabia vying with Shiite-led Iran and Iraq. All three countries have put forward candidates for the post of OPEC secretary general, who acts as the voice of the organization between meetings. But with their rivalries strong and potentially harmful to OPEC unity, the meeting is expected to skirt the issue and extend Libya's Abdullah Al-Badry's term for another year. ___ Margaret Childs contributed to this report. ||||| VIENNA: OPEC was expected to stick by its oil output limit at a meeting here even as Iraq and Iran eye higher crude exports amid slashed Libyan production. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries does not see a need to alter the cartel‚Äôs crude production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day, member nations led by the world‚Äôs biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia said in Vienna ahead of the meeting. Pumping about one third of the world‚Äôs crude, OPEC will decide also on whether to replace Abdullah El-Badri as secretary general. ‚ÄúWe know demand is good, economic growth is good, supply is good,‚Äù Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi told reporters at OPEC headquarters in the Austrian capital. OPEC members Nigeria and Venezuela each said they believed the cartel would agree to maintain its crude oil production ceiling. Oil market analysts were meanwhile not expecting any surprises from OPEC, whose dozen member nations from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are together producing slightly below its output target. ‚ÄúIt is unlikely that OPEC will adjust its official notional production ceiling as it is unlikely that either Iran and Iraq can contribute incrementally in any significant manner to the group‚Äôs supply next year,‚Äù Harry Tchilinguirian, BNP Paribas‚Äô global head of commodity markets strategy, told AFP. OPEC is facing also demand strains as consumers turn to cheaper oil and gas extracted from shale rock, particularly in North America. At the same time, Iraq and Iran are seeking to increase their production after sizable falls to output in recent years. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members argue that benchmark crude oil prices, currently averaging 100 per barrel, provide acceptable income for producers without weighing too heavily on consumers. ‚ÄúThe price of oil is acceptable and there will be some additional oil coming to the market from OPEC and outside OPEC,‚Äù Qatar‚Äôs Energy Minister Mohammed Al-Sada said. ‚ÄúWhat is more important is that this additional oil will be needed for the signs of economic recovery.‚Äù Al-Sada added: ‚ÄúThe current (output) situation seems to be comfortable... 30 million barrels seems to do justice to the current economic situation.‚Äù Iran‚Äôs Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh this week said that the country would be able to ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù export 4.0 million barrels per day (bpd) once sanctions are lifted in the wake of the international deal to roll back its nuclear program. Iranian crude oil exports have been slashed to about 1.2 million bpd from 2.5 million bpd in 2011, according to Zanganeh. At the same time, Iraq‚Äôs Oil Minister Abdelkarim Al-Luaybi said his country hoped to export 3.4 million bpd of crude oil next year, including 400,000 bpd from Iraqi Kurdistan, as it looks to recover from years of bloodshed. This compares with exports of 2.38 million bpd in November. The market though doubts how quickly new production can come on board. ‚ÄúOPEC will find it very hard to come to an agreement to cut production given a significant number of its members ‚Äî Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria ‚Äî are suffering from constrained production,‚Äù said Thomas Pugh, commodities analyst at Capital Economics consultants. Libya‚Äôs output has plunged to about 250,000 bpd amid deadly fighting between radical fighters and the army, but oil minister Abdelbari Al-Arusi said he hoped production would be back to its normal level of 1.5 million bpd within two weeks. Nigeria is meanwhile facing regular acts of sabotage to its oil pipelines. Saudi Arabia is battling against Iraq and Iran for the position of succeeding El-Badri, who has steered the cartel through the financial crisis in the role of administrative head since 2007. OPEC voted in December last year to re-appoint the Libyan for another year after members failed to agree on a new secretary general. ||||| This player has full sharing enabled: social, email, embed, etc. It has the ability to go fullscreen.

House Republicans are considering various legislative options that would either tacitly or explicitly rip the Obama administration‚Äôs nuclear deal with Iran. A handful of House GOP lawmakers told The Hill that the party is debating how best to express disapproval of the multilateral agreement, which was struck shortly after Congress left for Thanksgiving recess. ADVERTISEMENT House Majority Leader(R-Va.) on Tuesday was adamant during a closed-door meeting with Republicans that the White House explain the details of the agreement, a source in the room told The Hill. Noting that Cantor is ‚Äúvery concerned with where the president is leading us,‚Äù the source said the No. 2 GOP House leader intended to work closely with Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) to produce a legislative response. Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), said, ‚ÄúThe overwhelming sentiment [among House Republicans is] this was an agreement that was foolish, dangerous, and that we need to do something and push forward.‚Äù Many Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the nuclear pact because it does not insist that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asserted Iran got more than it gave up, saying it ‚Äúdoes not seem proportional.‚Äù Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper said, ‚ÄúThe leader does not believe the interim agreement the White House negotiated with Iran was in our nation‚Äôs best interests, so he will work with members on both sides of the aisle to determine that any final deal definitively addresses serious congressional concerns.‚Äù According to several participants at the Tuesday morning meeting, House Republicans focused on several possible responses to the six-month agreement endorsed by the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and Iran. Under the deal, Iran agreed to enrich less uranium and allow nuclear weapons inspections in exchange for the elimination of nearly 7 billion in sanctions. One option would be pressuring the Senate to consider new sanctions on Iran. The House this summer passed a bill with bipartisan support to do just that, 400-20. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has repeatedly noted that the House passed an Iran sanctions bill and that it is sitting in the Senate. Contrary to the wishes of the White House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Schumer have indicated the upper chamber will tackle a companion bill next week. The other option for House Republicans would be a resolution to formally disapprove of the interim deal. ‚ÄúI think that we should have a sense of the House that we oppose the deal,‚Äù said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a senior Foreign Affairs Committee member. Some Democrats would likely vote for such a measure, though Rohrabacher suspects ‚Äúthere are a lot of people on the Democratic side of the aisle who seem to feel compelled to support the administration on anything they possibly can, and this might fall within that range because you‚Äôve got a Democratic president under attack.‚Äù More than a few Republicans, including Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (Texas), have suggested the Iran agreement was timed to distract from the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare. It is unclear when the House will act on an Iran resolution; the lower chamber is scheduled to adjourn for the year at the end of next week. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the deal. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about how a survey showed that Americans had a favorable early impression of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. The British Royal Family refers to the close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom. However, the answer provided by Google does not give an extensive explanation about what the Royal Family does. Let me provide a more detailed answer for you. The British Royal Family has various roles and responsibilities that entail both constitutional and ceremonial duties, as well as involvement in social and charitable events. Their contribution to the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries extends across several areas, including the following: 1. Representing the nation: The royal family members, particularly the reigning monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II), represent the nation at different events and functions, both in the UK and abroad. They attend state visits, undertake foreign tours, and host foreign dignitaries, which strengthens international relationships and promotes cultural exchange. 2. Constitutional duties: While the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, the Queen has specific roles in the governance of the nation. Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of State and has the authority to sign bills into law through the Royal Assent, summon and dissolve the Parliament, and approve the appointment of government ministers and judges, among other tasks. In practice, these duties are mostly ceremonial and carried out on the advice of the Prime Minister and the government, reflecting the principles of a modern democracy. 3. Support for the Armed Forces: The British Royal Family has historical links with the armed forces. Many of its members have served in the military, undertaken official visits to military bases, and participated in honoring the service and dedication of armed forces members. Additionally, the Queen is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, a role that is primarily ceremonial. 4. Patronage and charity work: The members of the Royal Family support numerous charitable, social, and public organizations by becoming patrons, raising awareness, attending events, and encouraging fundraising efforts. Various specialized areas and causes, such as healthcare, sports, the arts, and conservation, receive royal backing, thereby gaining visibility and prominence. 5. Promoting national identity and unity: Through their unique roles, the British Royal Family plays a vital part in fostering national pride and a sense of unity.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a big fire happens, how will it affect more oxygen will reach the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a big fire happening can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, specifically on the availability of oxygen to reach the body and cellular respiration. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Direct Effects: When a big fire occurs, it consumes a significant amount of oxygen in the surrounding area. As the fire burns, it uses up oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, smoke, and other harmful gases. This can lead to a lower concentration of oxygen in the air, especially in closed or poorly ventilated areas. Since our cells rely on the continuous supply of oxygen to perform cellular respiration and produce energy, a reduced availability of oxygen due to the fire can stall the energy production process. Furthermore, the presence of smoke and harmful gases can cause respiratory issues that hinder the proper functioning of the respiratory system. This makes it difficult for the lungs to effectively extract oxygen from the air and deliver it to the cells. As a result, the cells might not receive enough oxygen, causing a strain on the energy production process and leading to inefficient cellular respiration. 2. Indirect Effects: The indirect effects of a big fire can also negatively impact the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. For instance, stress and anxiety caused by the fire can stimulate the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones elevate the heart rate and cause rapid breathing, increasing the body's demand for oxygen. However, the fire has already reduced the availability of oxygen in the air, making it difficult for the body to meet its increased oxygen needs. Additionally, prolonged exposure to high temperatures due to the fire can cause dehydration, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke. These conditions can lead to impaired respiratory and circulatory functions, interfering with the ability of the cardiovascular system to effectively transport oxygen to the body's cells. Consequently, the reduced supply of oxygen affects cellular respiration and energy production. In conclusion, the perturbation created by a big fire can have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. It leads to reduced oxygen availability in the air, respiratory difficulties, stress response, and impaired body functions, all of which hinder the efficient process of energy production in cells. This highlights the importance of ensuring proper safety measures and adequate ventilation in areas prone to fires or other emergencies."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the article and select the best answer.

A former World No. 1, he is known as \\"The Big Easy\\" due to his imposing physical stature (he stands 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)) along with his fluid golf swing. Among his 71 career victories are four major championships: the U.S. Open in 1994 at Oakmont and in 1997 at Congressional, and The Open Championship in 2002 at Muirfield and in 2012 at Royal Lytham & St Annes. He is one of six golfers to twice win both the U.S. Open and The Open Championship. Context: 1997 was a career year for Els first winning his second U.S. Open (once again over Colin Montgomerie) this time at Congressional Country Club, making him the first foreign player since Alex Smith (1906, 1910) to win the U.S. Open twice. He defended his Buick Classic title and added the Johnnie Walker Classic to his list of victories. Els nearly won the World Match Play Championship for a fourth consecutive year, but lost to Vijay Singh in the final. 1998 and 1999 continued to be successful years for Els with 4 wins on both the PGA and European tours. 2000 started in historic fashion for Els being given a special honour by the Board of Directors of the European Tour awarding him with honorary life membership of the European Tour because of his two U.S. Opens and three World Match Play titles. 2000 was the year of runners-up for Els; with three runner-up finishes in the Majors (Masters, U.S. Open and The Open Championship) and seven second-place finishes in tournaments worldwide. Els had a disappointing 2001 season, failing to win a US PGA tour event for the first time since 1994 although he ended the year with nine second-place finishes. 2002 was arguably Els's best year, which started with a win at the Heineken Classic at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Then went to America and outplayed World Number one Tiger Woods to lift the Genuity Championship title. The premier moment of the season was surely his Open Championship triumph in very tough conditions at Muirfield. Els overcame a four-man playoff to take home the famous Claret Jug trophy for the first time, also quieting his critics about his mental toughness. The South African also won his fourth World Match Play title, along with his third Nedbank Challenge in the last four years, dominating a world-class field and winning by 8 shots. Question: What happened in 1997? Answer:","output":"In 1997, Theodore Ernest Els, a South African golfer, had a great year. He won his second U.S. Open, which is a very important golf competition. This happened at a place called Congressional Country Club, and he was the first person from another country to win the U.S. Open twice since a man named Alex Smith did it in 1906 and 1910. Theodore also won two other competitions that year: the Buick Classic and the Johnnie Walker Classic. He almost won another one, the World Match Play Championship, but finished in second place. Overall, 1997 was a very successful year for him."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: A portable lung which could help those with breathing problems lead a normal life is being developed by scientists. The Swansea University scientists say it could take many years before the device , the size of a spectacle box , is available . Lung patients , who have seen how it would work , have welcomed the research. Its research suggests that one person in every seven in the UK is affected by lung disease---- this equates to approximately 8 million people. As of 6 March 2009, 217 people were on the waiting list for a lung transplant according to figures by NHS Blood and Transplant . Now scientists in Swansea are developing a portable artificial lung which could transform the lives of patients . Researchers claim that in the long term the device could offer an alternative to lung transplant , giving hope to those who suffer from conditions such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis. The device mimics the function of a lung---by getting oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the blood stream . Professor Bill Johns came up with the idea after his son died of Cystic Fibrosis . It is important that we make something that will help people , who instead of being confined to a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle , can actually walk around and do things for themselves , he said.

Explanation: When considering this question, we need to evaluate the factors that make outer space a hostile environment for humans. First, there is no breathable oxygen in space. Humans need a constant supply of oxygen to survive, and without it, they would lose consciousness within seconds and perish within a few minutes. Secondly, there is the issue of temperature. Space has extreme temperatures ranging from -270¬∞C to 120¬∞C, depending on exposure to the sun. These extreme temperature fluctuations would be lethal to a human without proper insulation. Another factor is the vacuum of space itself. In a vacuum, the boiling point of water decreases, which would cause the fluids in a person's body to rapidly boil and vaporize. This would result in severe swelling, internal damage, and ultimately death in just a matter of seconds. Additionally, there is constant radiation exposure in space, coming from sources such as cosmic rays and solar particles. While the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field protect us from these harmful waves on the ground, in space, humans would be directly exposed to them. The exposure to high levels of radiation can cause acute radiation sickness, long-term genetic damage, and increase the risk of cancer. Finally, space is filled with high-speed micro-meteoroids and debris. Without some form of protection, the impact of such objects traveling at high velocities could be deadly. Taking these factors into account, the answer to whether a person can survive in outer space without protective gear is: no."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: What is the name of Remy's ex-wife?

How many times does he use the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie? Answer. 3 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"Answer: John uses the bathroom 3 times during a 2.5-hour movie. Step-by-step reasoning: Step 1: Convert hours to minutes Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the duration of the movie from hours to minutes. To do that, multiply the duration of the movie in hours (2.5 hours) by the number of minutes per hour (60 minutes). 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Step 2: Calculate the number of times John uses the bathroom Now that we know the movie lasts for 150 minutes, we can determine how many times John uses the bathroom during this time. John uses the bathroom every 50 minutes, so to find out how many times he uses it during the movie, divide the total movie duration (150 minutes) by the time interval between each bathroom use (50 minutes). 150 minutes / 50 minutes/use = 3 Step 3: Final answer John uses the bathroom 3 times during the 2.5-hour movie."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \\"culture of coziness\\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \\"a systematic breakdown\\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \\"malfeasance, bordering on corruption.\\" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest 10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a 7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.

EU leaders met to discuss the crisis last week. The UK said it would provide naval support, but it would not accept more asylum seekers. Main pledges In a break from domestic campaigning for the UK general election, the UKIP leader travelled to Strasbourg for a debate in the European Parliament, following the meeting of the European Council on 23 April. European leaders agreed to triple funding for rescue operations aimed at migrant boats in the Mediterranean, and to look at ways to capture and destroy smugglers' boats and deploy immigration officers to non-EU countries, officials said. But many MEPs demanded bolder action, passing a resolution calling on the Commission to set a \\"binding quota\\" for the distribution of asylum seekers among EU states, amid concerns that southern European countries are bearing the brunt of the crisis. The resolution, which was backed by four of the European Parliament's major political groups, also called for expanded search and rescue operations, bigger contributions to resettlement programmes, better cooperation with non-EU states and tougher measures against people smugglers. The resolution is not binding on the Commission but Mr Farage alleged that a common asylum policy had been \\"agreed already\\" - and further claimed that extremist group Islamic State - also known as Isis - had threatened to send extremists to Europe through the Mediterranean route. Mr Farage, who is an MEP for the South East region, told the European Parliament: \\"When Isis say they want to flood our continent with half a million extremists they mean it.\\" He added: \\"If the message is that anybody that comes will be accepted we are headed for disaster.\\" It's shock and awe part two from Nigel Farage. As the final week of the election campaign approaches the UKIP leader has deployed the tactic that he is convinced worked so well for him and his party in the TV debates. A few weeks back it was foreigners with HIV getting free treatment on the NHS. Tonight it's the threat of IS inspired extremists coming to the UK on boats across the Med. He claims half a million could arrive in Europe. Nigel Farage is breaking off from the campaign on Wednesday to fly to Strasbourg to speak against plans for what he says is an EU common migration policy. Something he believes could pose \\"a direct threat to our civilisation\\". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the same debate that there was a need for member states to \\"share refugees geographically\\". Arguing that allowing a certain measure of legal migration could reduce the number trying to enter Europe illegally, he called for the door to Europe to be left \\"partly ajar\\". Speaking to journalists ahead of the debate, Mr Farage claimed: \\"The principle [of common asylum] has been accepted. All we're now talking about is the detail. \\"If people in Britain see what I'm doing today and understand the significance of what is going on, I think they will be very, very angry indeed and they would want to know from the two potential prime ministers: do they intend to opt us out of this or will they stick with the legal agreements that we agreed back in 2013? \\"We've got to a point here with this where, unless we stand up and say something, we will be opening up our doors not just to many more people but to the Islamic extremist threat.\\" Also speaking in the Strasbourg debate was Dutch MEP Sophia in 't Veld from the Liberal ALDE group, who called the UKIP leader's words \\"populist and despicable\\". She claimed the idea of a \\"flood of jihadists\\" had been \\"invented by Mr Farage to get himself elected on 7 May\\". An EU directive in 2013 reaffirmed the aim of a common asylum policy. However, EU leaders have not agreed a common asylum and immigration policy within the EU. An emergency meeting of EU leaders was convened last week after more than 750 people died on a boat crossing from Libya on 19 April. Whereas the total number of deaths in 2014 was 3,279, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says it fears the figure for this year could top 30,000, based on the current death rate. The UK - in the past a leading advocate of reducing naval patrols - said it would contribute helicopter carrier HMS Bulwark, two patrol boats and three helicopters. Germany, France and Belgium also offered ships. Prime Minister David Cameron did not commit the UK to accepting more refugees. Mr Farage also told the European Parliament that \\"we are guilty for this crisis\\", echoing earlier comments that the bombing of Libya has \\"directly caused\\" migrant disasters in the Mediterranean Sea. The UKIP leader has also said he has \\"not got a problem with us offering refugee status to some Christians\\" from the Middle East and North Africa. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, has alleged that a common EU asylum policy has already been agreed upon and claims that extremist group Islamic State has threatened to send extremists to Europe through the Mediterranean route.

Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\\" Answer: A:","output":"Scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotions by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality. This interdisciplinary approach is commonly practiced in sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, which aim to understand the complex relationship between the brain, behavior, and emotion. Emotions play a crucial role in human experiences, decision-making, and behaviors. They are deeply interconnected with various mental processes and have a significant impact on our overall well-being. The study of neural mechanisms of emotions focuses on how different emotions are generated, processed, and regulated in the brain, as well as how they influence our thoughts, actions, and interactions with others. One of the primary reasons for integrating neuroscience with personality psychology is the recognition that individual differences in emotional experience and regulation can be largely attributed to variations in personality traits. Personality refers to the unique and relatively enduring set of characteristics, tendencies, and patterns of behavior that define an individual. By examining the relationship between personality and emotions, researchers can gain insights into the neural processes underlying distinct emotional experiences. Some common methods used in the study of neural mechanisms of emotions include: 1. Brain imaging: Techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow researchers to monitor brain activity in real-time while participants experience or process different emotions. This helps in identifying the specific regions of the brain involved in emotional processing and regulation. 2. Lesion studies: These involve examining individuals with brain injuries or abnormalities that impact their emotional processing. By comparing their emotional experiences to those of healthy individuals, researchers can better understand the role of specific brain areas in generating and regulating emotions. 3. Genetic studies: Researchers can investigate the role of genetic factors in emotional processing and regulation by examining the relationship between specific genetic variants and individual differences in emotional experiences and personality traits. 4. Behavioral and self-report measures: Through questionnaires, interviews, and laboratory experiments, researchers can gather information on emotional experiences, personality traits, and behavior in response to emotional stimuli. This data can help in understanding how emotions and personality factors interact and influence decision-making, problem-solving, and social interactions. Some of the significant findings in this field include the identification of key brain regions responsible for processing specific emotions, such as the amygdala's involvement in fear and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex's role in reward processing. Moreover, studies have revealed that individual differences in personality traits, such as extraversion and neuroticism, are linked to variations in the neural processing and regulation of emotions. In conclusion, by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, scientists can delve deeper into understanding the neural mechanisms behind diverse emotions and how they influence human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach not only sheds light on the intricacies of the human mind but also opens opportunities for developing novel treatments and interventions for various emotional disorders and promoting overall mental health."},{"instruction":"I love pizza.

Movie: The Disappointing Disaster Rating: 1/5 The Disappointing Disaster, directed by John Doe, was one of the most anticipated releases this year, but it turned out to be exactly what the title suggests, a disaster. Upon entering the theater, I was filled with excitement and high expectations, only to be let down by the lack of creativity and coherence of the plot. The storyline seemed to be an amalgamation of various clich√©d plots that left audiences feeling underwhelmed. With a weak script, one would hope that film's star-studded cast, including popular actors John Smith and Jane Doe, could save the movie. Unfortunately, their talents were wasted in poorly written characters, and it was painful to watch them struggle with their scenes. Moreover, the pacing of the film was poorly executed. Confusing edits and abrupt scene changes made it seem as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to create an epic saga, but they ended up with a chaotic mess. The film could have benefited from a more straightforward presentation and a focus on the narrative. As for the visual effects, they were severely lacking. The CGI was glaringly obvious, and any sense of immersion was lost due to low-quality special effects. In today's age of advanced technology, the creators of The Disappointing Disaster failed to make use of available resources to enhance the movie's visuals. The film's predictable plot, combined with the weak performances, made it challenging to feel any emotional connection with the characters. What could have been an engaging and enthralling cinematic experience turned into a tedious, lackluster event for viewers. To summarize, The Disappointing Disaster lives up to its unfortunate name. With a forgettable plot, sub-par visual effects, and a terrible waste of the talents of its star cast, it failed to deliver on any front.

On Tuesday, the government charged drug distributor Rochester Drug Co-operative Inc and company executives for their role in fueling the epidemic. The company agreed to pay 20 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve charges it turned a blind eye to thousands of suspicious orders for opioid pain killers. ‚ÄúWe are holding big Pharma accountable,‚Äù Trump said at the Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta. Deaths from opioid overdose in the United States jumped 17 percent in 2017 from a year earlier to more than 49,000 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Deaths from potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl surged 45 percent in that time, according to the CDC. Hundreds of lawsuits by state and local governments accuse drugmakers such as Purdue Pharma of deceptively marketing opioids, and distributors such as AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp of ignoring that they were being diverted for improper uses. Trump said he convinced Chinese President Xi Jinping in a December meeting in Argentina to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance. China last month listed all fentanyl-related substances as controlled narcotics after criticism from Trump, though its government blamed U.S. culture for abuse of the drug and said the amount of fentanyl going from China into the United States was ‚Äúextremely limited.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlmost all fentanyl comes from China,‚Äù Trump said on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThey are going to make it a major crime.‚Äù Little has come of Trump‚Äôs earlier calls for executing drug dealers. But the administration has taken some action to address the crisis on other fronts. Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in October 2017. Last week, U.S. health officials said they will spend 350 million in four states to study ways to best deal with the opioid crisis on the local level, with a goal of reducing opioid-related overdose deaths by 40 percent over three years in selected communities in those states. The Democratic National Committee said in a statement before Trump‚Äôs remarks that his proposed Medicaid cuts and efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, could make the opioid problem worse. Trump has used the crisis to support his call for building a wall on the border with Mexico, saying it would help keep out heroin and other illegal drugs and curb the crisis. Claim: Trump says he is holding big Pharma accountable in opioid fight.

This highly unethical and deeply troubling practice violates the rights of the deceased and their families, and casts a dark shadow over the organ transplantation community. This report aims to delve into the details of this alarming issue, explore the factors leading to such practices, and identify potential solutions that can help maintain the sanctity of the organ donation process. Background: In the field of medicine, organ transplantation continues to save countless lives. However, the ever-increasing demand for organs continues to outpace the supply. This shortage prompts a desperate need for finding viable organs that can be transplanted. Unfortunately, it appears that certain unscrupulous medical professionals and organizations might be taking advantage of this situation to remove organs from deceased individuals without proper consent from the family. Legal and Ethical Violations: Organ removal from a deceased individual without family consent constitutes not only a breach of trust and moral principles but also a violation of the law. In most countries, consent from the deceased or their immediate family members is a mandatory requirement for organ donation. Removing organs without consent not only disrespect the autonomy and wishes of the deceased but also robs the family of their right to make an informed decision about organ donation. Moreover, it undermines public trust in the organ transplant system and can potentially deter many prospective organ donors from coming forward. Factors Contributing to Organ Removal without Consent: The government report has highlighted a discernible pattern leading to unauthorized organ removal. Key contributing factors include: 1. Extreme pressure to meet organ demand: The ever-increasing demand for organs pushes transplant centers and medical professionals into procuring organs through illicit means. 2. Lack of proper oversight: Insufficient monitoring and supervision may embolden unscrupulous healthcare providers to engage in unethical organ procurement practices. 3. The complexity of consent procedures: Navigating the consent process can be time-consuming and challenging for both healthcare providers and the bereaved family. This may lead to shortcuts or miscommunication that could result in the organs being removed without consent. 4. Financial incentives: In some horror cases, organs may be removed illegally and sold in the black market, as they are a highly valuable commodity, often fetching exorbitant prices. Addressing the Crisis: Potential Solutions and Recommendations To curb this unethical practice, concerted actions must be taken on multiple fronts. The government and healthcare organizations must adopt the following recommendations: 1. Strengthening regulatory frameworks: Laws should be clarified, and penalties should be imposed on those engaging in unauthorized organ removal. Licensing requirements for transplant centers should be revised and enforced to ensure that they abide by proper protocols. 2. Increasing transparency and oversight: Independent investigation agencies should be appointed to conduct regular assessments and monitoring of organ procurement organizations. Regular reports and stricter penalties should be mandated in cases of violations. 3. Simplifying consent procedures: The process for giving consent to organ donation should be made more accessible and intuitive. Public awareness campaigns should focus on educating people about the importance of discussing their organ donation wishes with their family members. 4. Addressing organ shortage: To reduce the pressure on transplant centers to engage in unethical practices, authorities should promote deceased and living organ donation, and research should be encouraged for developing alternative medical solutions, such as regenerative medicine, xenotransplantation, and bioartificial organs. Conclusion: Unauthorized organ removal gravely affects the lives of the deceased and their grieving families. It is imperative that the government report's findings be taken seriously, and immediate action must be taken to ensure the ethical procurement of organs for transplantation. The organ transplant community must regain the trust of individuals and families by ensuring adherence to robust ethical and legal practices. This requires a coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including medical professionals, transplant centers, organ procurement organizations, and the government, to tackle this urgent crisis and protect the sanctity of organ donation."},{"instruction":"The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares, when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the insurgents, and many innocent victims.

Main Characters: Danny, a high school senior; Arthur, Danny's best friend and classmate; Stacey, Arthur's older sister who is in college. Step 2: Establishing Relationships and Introducing the Love Interest Danny is a charismatic and charming high school senior whose interests lie in art and indie films. Arthur, his best friend, is a smart and ambitious student with a passion for science. They have been friends since childhood, and Danny frequently spends time at Arthur's house. During one such visit, Danny meets Arthur's older sister, Stacey, who has come home from college for the weekend. Danny becomes infatuated with Stacey, who is not only gorgeous but is also witty, talented, and shares Danny's passion for art and indie films. Step 3: Developing the Plot In an attempt to get closer to Stacey, Danny starts going to college art events and indie film showings in the town, often accompanied by Arthur. Arthur is initially clueless about Danny's infatuation with his sister, but eventually begins to suspect there's more to his friend's sudden interest in college events. Danny and Stacey grow closer, and Stacey starts confiding in Danny as they bond over their shared interests. Step 4: The Conflict As Danny's feelings for Stacey intensify, he becomes worried about Arthur's reaction and fears his friendship with Arthur might be damaged if his secret comes to light. Danny struggles to keep his feelings for Stacey under wraps while still trying to pursue a deeper connection with her. When Arthur confronts Danny about his suspicions, Danny denies having feelings for Stacey to save their friendship. Step 5: The Climax As Danny continues to suppress his true feelings, Stacey is offered an opportunity to study art abroad for a year. Danny, realizing he can't let her go without sharing how he feels, decides to express his love for Stacey at her going-away party. As the party unfolds, Danny gathers up the courage and admits his feelings to Stacey in front of Arthur and other friends. This leads to an emotional confrontation between Danny and Arthur, who feels betrayed and hurt that his best friend lied to him. Step 6: The Resolution Facing the consequences of his confession, Danny finally understands how important his friendship with Arthur is to him. Although Stacey reciprocates Danny's feelings, they both agree that it's best to pursue their own dreams for the time being and not let their budding romance jeopardize Danny's relationship with Arthur. Danny and Arthur make amends, and Danny supports Stacey in her decision to study abroad. The movie ends with Danny and Arthur reaffirming their friendship and a promise to always be honest with each other. The movie, a coming-of-age tale, will explore themes of friendship, love, and the importance of making difficult choices for personal growth."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

In the context of a race, this could mean having longer strides or being able to cover a greater distance per step. 3. Evaluate the possible answers: a. Victory: While having a reaching advantage might give a racer an edge, it does not guarantee victory. Many other factors, such as speed, endurance, and strategy, can also determine who wins a race. b. Being ahead: A reaching advantage allows a racer to cover more ground per stride, which could help them stay ahead of others. c. Winning prize: Prizes are often associated with victory, but like victory itself, a reaching advantage does not guarantee winning a prize. d.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who actually does discover that Owen is the killer? Movie plot title: Untraceable Movie plot: Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck).

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Untraceable,\\" it is Special Agent Jennifer Marsh who ultimately discovers that Owen Reilly is the killer. Jennifer is a member of the FBI's cybercrime division and first becomes involved in the case when she receives an anonymous tip about the gruesome website, KillWithMe.com, which shows videos of people being tortured and killed. The violence escalates with each video, the fate of the victims linked directly to the number of visitors the page receives. Given the evidence and the pattern established by the killer, Jennifer starts suspecting that the victims aren't chosen at random. Some victims had participated in filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher, leading Jennifer to believe there may be some connection to this event. This suspicion is confirmed when she learns about Owen Reilly, the unstable son of the teacher who committed suicide. Following his father's death, Owen was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, but after being released, he designed this horrifying scheme of revenge on those who he believed exploited his father's tragedy and death. He aimed to illustrate the public's insatiable interest in the suffering of others. Griffin Dowd, Jennifer's colleague, was killed because he was close to discovering the murderer's identity, thus making the dots connect for Jennifer to suspect Owen. Further on, Jennifer becomes a target after she figures out that Owen is the deranged mind behind the atrocious web murders. Despite being captured by Owen, Jennifer manages to escape, further cementing her understanding of Owen‚Äôs deadly game.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - after excretion - before digestion - after digestion - during digestion A: The answer is:","output":"To determine the correct answer, I will carefully read the paragraph and analyze the context to find a statement related to when nutrients are absorbed into the body. However, there is no paragraph provided. Since I cannot read the paragraph, I cannot provide the answer based on the context. Instead, I will use my general knowledge on the subject of nutrients absorption in the human body to choose the correct answer. Step 1: Analyze the choices based on general knowledge of the process of digestion: - After excretion: Excretion happens after nutrients have been absorbed, so this choice is not correct. - Before digestion: Nutrients need to be broken down from the food for absorption, which happens during digestion. Therefore, this choice is not correct. - After digestion: This choice seems plausible because nutrients are absorbed once the food has been broken down. - During digestion: This choice could also be plausible because absorption might occur simultaneously as the food is being digested. Step 2: Compare the two plausible choices - After digestion: It implies that absorption happens only after the entire process of digestion has been completed. - During digestion: It suggests that absorption occurs as the food is being digested, i.e., nutrients are absorbed simultaneously as the food is broken down. Step 3: Choose the best option Based on my general knowledge of digestion and absorption, nutrients absorption occurs during the digestion process. As the food passes through the small intestine, nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the correct answer is: during digestion."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a sentence in Tagalog language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.

Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers. But I can use this background: Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find. What is an answer for this question: Would companies in Norway find return on investment harder or easier? Answer:","output":"Companies in Norway may find return on investment harder in comparison to Sweden, as they have not broken up their large electric power suppliers into smaller companies to create a more competitive electricity market. With less competition, it may be more difficult for companies to achieve efficiency improvements and to access more investment opportunities in the Norwegian market. Moreover, as mentioned, transmission and distribution are harder problems to tackle with investments due to less apparent returns, which further adds to the difficulty in finding returns on investment for companies in Norway."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Take a cold shower or bath. Make a cold compress. Soak the area in a bicarbonate solution. Take an oatmeal bath or make an oatmeal paste. Use aloe vera on the area. Use fresh mint.","output":"Title: Natural Remedies to Soothe and Relieve Sunburn Introduction: Summertime is all about sunny days, vacations, and enjoying outdoor activities. However, being under the sun for prolonged periods can sometimes lead to painful sunburns. Sunburn is our skin's reaction to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, causing redness, inflammation, and irritation. Although prevention is key by using sunscreen and avoiding long hours under direct sunlight, sunburn can still occur. Before reaching for medicated creams and pain relievers, consider trying these natural remedies to soothe and relieve sunburn. 1. Take a Cold Shower or Bath One of the simplest methods to provide relief from a mild sunburn is taking a cold shower or a bath. Cold water eases the pain by constricting blood vessels and cooling the skin. Gently pat your skin dry with a towel instead of rubbing it, as sensitive sunburned skin can get further irritated. 2. Make a Cold Compress Another effortless way to ease the pain of sunburn is using a cold compress. Soak a washcloth in cold water, wring out any excess water, and apply the compress to the affected area. Repeat the process as needed for instant relief. An alternative is using a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a thin cloth to avoid direct contact with icy surfaces. 3. Soak the Affected Area in a Bicarbonate Solution Baking soda can help alleviate the sting of a sunburn. Fill a tub with cool water and add ¬Ω to 1 cup of baking soda. Stir it well to mix, then submerge the sunburned area in the solution. You can also mix baking soda with water to form a paste and apply it directly to the affected area. Allow it to sit for a few minutes and rinse it off with cold water. 4. Take an Oatmeal Bath and Make an Oatmeal Paste Oatmeal is known for its skin-soothing properties, making it an ideal solution for sunburn relief. Fill a bathtub with cool water, sprinkle in 1 to 2 cups of ground oats, and soak for about 20 minutes. Alternatively, create an oatmeal paste by mixing ground oats with just enough water to form a spreadable consistency. Apply the paste to the sunburned area and leave it on until it dries before rinsing off with cold water. 5. Use Aloe Vera on the Affected Area Aloe vera is a go-to remedy for minor burns, as it provides cooling and soothing effects with its natural anti-inflammatory properties. Apply pure aloe vera gel, either directly from the plant or store-bought, to the sunburned area. The aloe vera gel quickly absorbs into the skin, reducing redness and irritation. Reapply as often as necessary. 6. Use Fresh Mint Leaves Mint is another natural option to soothe sunburn due to its cooling properties. Crush a handful of fresh mint leaves to release their oils and apply them to the sunburned area. Leave it on for several minutes before rinsing with cool water. Alternatively, prepare a mint tea by steeping the leaves in boiling water, then cool the tea and soak a cloth in it. Use the soaked cloth as a compress for additional relief. Conclusion: Natural remedies for sunburn can provide significant relief and help your skin heal faster. When applying these treatments, remember to be gentle and avoid exposing the affected area to further sun exposure. Also, stay hydrated to help your body recover quickly. While sunburns are common during the summer months, protecting your skin from dangerous UV rays should be a priority. Wear protective clothing, apply sunscreen of at least SPF 30, and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours. By embracing preventative measures and using natural remedies when needed, you'll be better equipped to enjoy a sunburn-free summer."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: hi, my name is eastpearl and i am 19 years.","output":"Hi, my name is Eastpearl and I am 19 years old."},{"instruction":"when ordering your sandstones, you select which colour scale you would want. it could be e.g. a 100% from grey/sand mix, or 80% fra beige/yellow mixed with 20% from black/brown.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania.

He is the older brother of Allan Holdsworth and James Taylor bassist Jimmy Johnson . - Paul Winter (born August 31, 1939) is an American saxophonist (alto and soprano saxophone), and is a seven-time Grammy Award winner. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Glen Velez (born 1949) is an American percussionist, vocalist, and composer, specializing in frame drums from around the world. He is largely responsible for the increasing popularity of frame drums in the United States and around the world. - Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945) is an American jazz and classical music pianist. - The violin is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused in the 2010s. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music. They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music; further, the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, particularly in Irish traditional music and bluegrass, but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it. - Peter Ostroushko (born August 12, 1953) is an American violinist and mandolinist. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Russ Landau is an American composer of film and television scores and themes including \\"seaQuest 2032\\", \\"Survivor\\", \\"Fear Factor\\", and \\"Pirate Master\\" for which he won an Emmy in 2008. He is an alumnus of the University of Bridgeport class of 1977 (South End, Bridgeport, Connecticut). - The Paul Winter Consort is an American musical group, led by soprano saxophonist Paul Winter. Founded in 1967, the group mixes elements of jazz, classical music, world music, and the sounds of animals and nature. They are often classified as \\"new age\\" or \\"ecological jazz\\", and their musical style is often called \\"Earth Music\\". The group has had many lineup changes since it was founded. Long-standing members currently in the group include Paul Winter, cellist Eugene Friesen, bassist Eliot Wadiopan, jazz oboist Paul McCandless, and percussionist and frame drum specialist Glen Velez. Past members who were part of the group for a considerable length of time include Paul Halley, Susan Osborn, Oscar Castro-Neves, Russ Landau, David Darling, Jim Scott and Rhonda Larson. - Oscar Castro-Neves (May 15, 1940 - September 27, 2013), was a Brazilian guitarist, arranger, and composer who is considered a founding figure in bossa nova. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Eugene Friesen (born 1952) is an American cellist and composer. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Stanley Newcomb \\"Stan\\" Kenton (December 15, 1911 August 25, 1979) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger who led an innovative, influential, and often controversial progressive jazz orchestra. In later years he was active as an educator. - Paul McCandless, Jr. (born March 24, 1947, Indiana, Pennsylvania) is an American multi-instrumentalist known for his time with the group Oregon. He is one of few expert jazz oboists. He also plays bass clarinet, English horn, and soprano saxophone. - Austin City Limits (ACL) is an American public television music program recorded live in Austin, Texas, by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station KLRU, and broadcast on many PBS stations around the United States. The show helped Austin to become widely known as the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\", and is the only television show to receive the National Medal of Arts, which it was awarded in 2003. It also won a rare institutional Peabody Award in 2011 \\"for its more than three decades of presenting and preserving eclectic American musical genres.\\" For the first 12 seasons (1976-1987), \\"Austin City Limits\\" was produced by the Southwest Texas Public Broadcasting Council. Beginning in Season 13 (1988), \\"Austin City Limits\\" moved to its current production home at Austin's PBS affiliate KLRU, the Capital of Texas Public Telecommunications Council. - Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. He was one of the major innovators of the free jazz movement of the 1960s, a term he invented with the name of . He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1994. His album \\"Sound Grammar\\" received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music. - A sideman is a professional musician who is hired to perform or record with a group of which he or she is not a regular member. They often tour with solo acts as well as bands and jazz ensembles. Sidemen are generally required to be adaptable to many different styles of music, and so able to fit smoothly into the group in which they are currently playing. Often aspiring musicians start out as sidemen, and then move on to develop their own sound, a name, and fans of their own, or go on to form their own groups. Some examples of this are: Some sidemen become famous for their musical specialties, and become highly sought-after by pop, rock, blues, jazz and country music bands. Examples of some of these include multi-instrumentalists. David Lindley is a multi-instrumentalist who has worked with such diverse musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Dolly Parton, Jackson Browne, and Hani Naser. Lindley used his time as a sideman to discover and master new instruments while on tour around the world, becoming proficient on ethnic instruments rarely seen in Western music genres. He has mastered so many that he admits to losing count, and instead placed a photo gallery of them on his website. - Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from \\"quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth\\". - Stacey Kent (born March 27, 1968) is a Grammy-nominated American jazz singer. She is married to British tenor saxophonist Jim Tomlinson - Reno is a city in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is located in Northern Nevada, approximately from Lake Tahoe. Known as \\"The Biggest Little City in the World\\", Reno is famous for its casinos and as the birthplace of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It is the county seat of Washoe County, located in the northwestern part of the state. The city sits in a high desert at the foot of the Sierra Nevada and its downtown area (along with Sparks) occupies a valley informally known as the Truckee Meadows. - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - Lorie Line (born 1958) is a classically trained pianist, composer, and performer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The instrument known today as the flugelhorn was developed from the valved bugle and is a member of the saxhorn family, which was developed by Adolphe Sax, who also created the saxophone family. The modern flugelhorn and Sax's B soprano (contralto) saxhorn are practically the same instrument. - A bandleader is the leader of a music group such as a rock or pop group or jazz quartet. The term is most commonly, though not exclusively, used with a group that plays popular music as a small combo or a big band, such as one which plays jazz, blues, rhythm and blues or rock and roll music. Most bandleaders are also performers with their own band, either as singers or as instrumentalists, playing an instrument such as electric guitar, piano, or other instruments. - Charles Frank \\"Chuck\\" Mangione (born November 29, 1940) is an American flugelhorn player, trumpeter and composer. - Walter Dewey Redman (May 17, 1931 September 2, 2006) was an American jazz saxophonist, known for performing free jazz as a bandleader, and with Ornette Coleman and Keith Jarrett.

Answer:","output":"No answer"},{"instruction":"Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Dr. Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (nee Sweetser) Leadon, devout Roman Catholics. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar. As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, where he met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit, the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player Chris Hillman, with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the Air Force in 1963. His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family once again relocated to Gainesville, Florida, when his father accepted a position as Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida. Leadon attended Gainesville High School, where he met classmate and future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder, whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills. Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend Tom Petty and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician Tom Leadon). A call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967, to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group, Hearts & Flowers, was enticing enough for Leadon to return to California, where he soon became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, their second release Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have siblings?","output":"Yes, Bernie Leadon had siblings.

First, we want to get all the b's (the times when b's mommy is hugging b) on one side of the equation. So, let's add 23*b to both sides to get rid of the -23*b on the left side. This gives us: -61 = 24*b + 107 (because b + 23*b = 24*b, b's mommy hugs b 24 times now.) 3. Now, we want to get rid of the 107 on the right side. So let's subtract 107 from both sides: -61 - 107 = 24*b - 107 + 107. This simplifies to: -168 = 24*b (we took away 107 candies from both sides.) 4. Finally, we want to find out how many times b's mommy hugs b (the value of b) by itself. So, we need to divide both sides by 24: (-168 √∑ 24) = (24*b √∑ 24). That simplifies to: -7 = b.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Pick from: - Cut slowly and carefully around the edges of the block letters you drew on the tape, or use a stencil and cut along the borders of the letters you want. - Cut lines slowly and carefully in the center of the block letters you drew on the tape, or use a stencil and cut along the borders of the letters you want.","output":"To accomplish the goal of writing using duct tape, the method that makes more sense is to cut slowly and carefully around the edges of the block letters you drew on the tape, or use a stencil and cut along the borders of the letters you want. This approach is more effective because it results in clearer, more legible letters and allows for greater precision in the overall process. Here are the steps for using this method: 1. Choose your duct tape: Begin by selecting a duct tape that is easy to work with and comes in a color that you find appealing. Keep in mind that some duct tapes have stronger adhesives or are thicker, which might make cutting and handling more difficult. 2. Create or find a stencil: To ensure accuracy and proper sizing, you may want to create your own stencil of the letters you desire using a stencil-making material like cardstock or plastic. Alternatively, you can find pre-made letter stencils in various fonts and sizes at your local craft store or online. 3. Trace the letters: Carefully apply your duct tape onto the desired surface, smoothing out any air bubbles or wrinkles. If you are using a stencil, position it properly, and then carefully trace your letters onto the tape using a pencil or a fine-tip permanent marker. If you are drawing the letters freehand, try to make sure your lines have an even thickness and consistent shape for a polished look. 4. Cut around the edges of the block letters: Using a sharp craft knife, carefully cut along the traced lines to create the shape of your letter. Be sure to maintain a steady hand to ensure even, clean cuts. For better control, consider using a cutting mat or a piece of thick cardboard as a surface that can protect your table while you work. 5. Peel away excess tape: After cutting out your letters, gently peel away the excess tape outside the shape of the letter. Be cautious not to rip the tape or damage the surrounding area, as this may impact the final appearance of your project. 6. Smooth out the cut letters: Run your finger or a flat, blunt object along the edges of the cut letters to ensure that they are fully adhered to your chosen surface. This will help prevent the edges from lifting and give your project a professional appearance. 7. Keep refining as needed: Depending on your project, you might need to trim any rough edges or cut additional shapes to achieve the desired effect. Practice patience and remain focused on your goal to create a polished piece of duct tape art or messaging. By following these steps and cutting slowly and carefully around the edges of the block letters you drew on the tape, or by using a stencil and cutting along the borders of the letters you want, you will achieve a more legible, precise result that is visually appealing and accomplishes your goal of writing using duct tape."},{"instruction":"You are given a short paragraph, a question and two choices to answer from.

Friendly Gathering: One possibility is that Sasha has organized a friendly get-together at the barn after school for a small group of friends, including Quinn. This could be a surprise party, a study group, or just a casual hangout for everyone to unwind after a long day at school. In this situation, Quinn would likely enjoy their time with friends and appreciate Sasha's initiative. 2. One-on-One Meeting: Sasha might want to discuss a personal or private matter with Quinn and has chosen the barn as a discrete location. This scenario could involve anything from sharing a secret or expressing personal feelings to seeking support or advice on a specific issue. Quinn's experience here would depend on the nature of the conversation and their relationship with Sasha. 3. Conflict Resolution: If Sasha and Quinn have recently been involved in a disagreement, the barn meeting might serve as an opportunity to clear the air and resolve their conflict. This encounter could be challenging and emotional for the both of them, but ultimately may lead to a better understanding and resolution of the disagreement. 4. Unexpected Adventure: Perhaps the barn holds secrets, or Sasha has found something interesting there that she wants to share with Quinn.

They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They increase an organism‚Äôs changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two: Paragraph: Organisms are constantly exposed to different kinds of radiations. Keith was studying the effect of radiations on a organism in two different locations, place A and place B. He noticed that in place A the the organism had beneficial mutation due to the radiation. On the other hand, in place B, the organism didn't have beneficial mutation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place the organism would less likely develop proteins to adapt in their habitat, place A or place B? The answer is:","output":"In place B, the organism would be less likely to develop proteins to adapt in their habitat. This is because, according to the paragraph, the organism in place A had beneficial mutations due to the radiation, which leads to new versions of proteins that help them adapt to their environment.

The city has a population of 1.26 million, while 1.68 million people live in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country, within less than drive from the Serbian border. Its location in the centre of the Balkan peninsula means that it is the midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, whereas the Aegean Sea is the closest to it. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Vitosha, the ancient \\"Scomius\\" or \\"Scombrus\\", is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as \\"Cherni Vrah\\" (\\"\\"Black Peak\\"\\"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium‚Äîthere is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant‚Äîthe changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. I am facing a new situation today: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would side B see less or more deformed Earth than side A? A:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation described, side B would see a less deformed Earth than side A. The reason for this difference lies in the way the Moon's gravitational field interacts with the Earth. As stated in the article, the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, which means it exerts a slightly stronger force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon (side A) and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side (side B). This difference in gravitational force results in the \\"stretching\\" of the Earth along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit due to this stretching, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, primarily horizontally. As a consequence, the constantly changing tidal force generated by the Moon's gravitational field causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height across the Earth. When comparing side A and side B, we can expect to see a greater deformation on side A, because the Moon's gravitational force is stronger on the side facing the Moon. As the Earth rotates, side A experiences a stronger tidal force, leading to more significant changes in sea surface height and overall deformation of Earth's surface. In contrast, side B experiences a weaker tidal force due to its position on the opposite side of the Earth, resulting in less deformation as compared to side A. To summarize, the difference in the Moon's gravitational field strength between side A and side B directly affects the extent of Earth's deformation. Side A, which faces the Moon and experiences a stronger gravitational force, will see a more deformed Earth than side B, which is positioned on the opposite side and experiences a weaker gravitational force."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: The designer of the Apple Computer, Steve Jobs, was not quite successful in his early years.

When the left ventricle fails to pump blood effectively, it leads to increased pressure in specific areas of the circulatory system. Step 1: Identify the affected areas The left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the aorta. Step 2: Understand the impact When the left ventricle fails, it fails to pump blood effectively, leading to an accumulation of blood in and around the left ventricle. Step 3: Trace back the increased pressure Increased pressure resulting from the failure of the left ventricle will first be observed in the left atrium since the left ventricle cannot properly handle the blood being sent to it by the left atrium. Step 4: Further pressure increase As the left atrium experiences increased pressure, it will cause a backup of blood in the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. Step 5: Observe the final impact Eventually, the increased pressure in the pulmonary veins causes fluid to accumulate in the lungs, leading to pulmonary congestion and edema (fluid buildup in the lung tissue). This increased pressure in the lungs can make it difficult to breathe and could cause shortness of breath and other respiratory issues. To summarize, the failure of the left ventricle will cause increased pressure in the left atrium, pulmonary veins, and the lungs. This can lead to pulmonary congestion and edema, making it difficult for the individual to breathe."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).

How can you make it work? Does long distance relationships actually work? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options are: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[2]. Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing. They are both inquiring about the efficacy of long-distance relationships and how to make them successful. Long-distance relationships, like any type of relationship, can work if both partners are committed, communicative, and share the same values and goals for the future. However, they may require more effort and patience than a typical relationship due to the challenges that come with the geographic distance between partners. Here are some strategies and tips for making a long-distance relationship work: 1. Communication: Communication is vital to any relationship but is especially critical in a long-distance one. Developing and maintaining open and honest communication with your partner can help to create a strong emotional connection, even if you're geographically distant from each other. 2. Plan regular visits: While the frequency of visits depends on individual circumstances (such as financial and time constraints), planning regular visits to see each other can help to maintain the physical aspect of the relationship and give you both something to look forward to. 3. Set mutual goals: Establish shared objectives for the future, such as discussing eventual plans for closing the distance (if possible), career goals, and potentially starting a family, can help both partners feel more secure and committed to the relationship. 4. Trust each other: Trust is essential for any successful relationship, and this can be a challenge in long-distance relationships. Both partners must trust and support each other in their decisions and understand that they may face unique challenges or temptations as a result of the distance. 5. Be flexible: Long-distance relationships can often require flexibility regarding expectations and how plans might change. It's essential to be open to adapting and adjusting in response to external factors. 6. Establish a routine: Creating a routine for daily or weekly communication helps maintain a sense of normalcy in the relationship. Establishing regular habits like a morning text, a goodnight call, or a weekly video chat can provide stability and predictability. 7. Utilize technology: Advances in technology have made long-distance relationships more manageable. Make use of video chat platforms like Skype, FaceTime, or Zoom to not only communicate but also to share experiences like watching movies or cooking dinner together. 8. Keep the romance alive: The lack of physical intimacy can be challenging for long-distance couples. Make efforts to keep the romance alive through surprise gestures like sending a care package, handwritten letters, or even planning an elaborate virtual date night. 9. Cultivate other interests: Being in a long-distance relationship may sometimes lead to feelings of isolation. Channel this energy into developing hobbies, making new friends, and working on personal goals to avoid feeling overly dependent on the relationship for happiness. 10. Stay positive: It's important to maintain a positive mindset and focus on the goal of eventually closing the distance or maintaining a strong emotional connection despite the physical distance between you. Ultimately, the success of a long-distance relationship lies within the commitment and effort of both partners. Employing strategies such as these may improve the relationship's chances of thriving despite geographical limitations."},{"instruction":"Read the given query and classify it as a 'Good' or 'Bad' query depending on how well the query is formed, 'Bad' being the expected output for a not so well formed query and 'Good' being the expected output for a well formed query.

Set in 2044, in a dystopia with Turner Classic Movies flavor, it puts a spin on the familiar figure of the existentially troubled gun for hire while leaving a layer of dust on many of the other genre fundamentals it plays with. Some of it you‚Äôve seen and heard before, intentionally so, though it adds a weird wrinkle: an attempt to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt , his nose prosthetically bobbed and a smirk surfing his thinned upper lip, into the wisecracking Bruce Willis of the ‚ÄúMoonlighting‚Äù years. The ostensible reason for Mr. Gordon-Levitt‚Äôs extreme makeover is that he and Mr. Willis are playing the same contract killer, Joe, at different ages. A looper, the young Joe works for an outfit that exists 30 years beyond 2044, where time travel exists but is illegal. Whenever the outfit wants to dispose of a ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù it sends the problem with a hood over his head into the past where a looper is waiting with a gun to blow him to smithereens. The hook ‚Äî you can almost hear the original movie pitch it‚Äôs so tidy ‚Äî is that every so often the outfit sends back an older looper, who‚Äôs unknowingly killed by his younger self, which is how the 2044 Joe stares down his middle-aged counterpart. It isn‚Äôt a happy meeting, but the writer and director Rian Johnson makes it a largely diverting one, filled with wit, smashing edits and showy, at times distracting allusions that reflect his cleverness like little mirrors. Slamming genre cheap thrills together with high-art aspirations, Mr. Johnson spins a fast-moving entertainment out of a setup that could have been cooked up by the science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and was undoubtedly influenced by Chris Marker‚Äôs cinematic touchstone from 1962, ‚ÄúLa Jet√©e,‚Äù in which scientists in a postapocalyptic world send, as the film puts it, ‚Äúemissaries into time to call past and future to the rescue of the present.‚Äù The middle-aged Joe sets off on a similar mission, trying to persuade his younger self to go along. It‚Äôs a juicy premise, ripe for the squeezing, though it takes a while to get over Joe‚Äôs looking less like a young Mr. Willis and more like Keanu Reeves with a dash of Marlon Brando doing Japanese minstrel for ‚ÄúThe Teahouse of the August Moon.‚Äù Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen, blasted corpses included, yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitt‚Äôs mug. The makeover is a distracting miscalculation and a curious one given that, for his last movie, ‚ÄúThe Brothers Bloom,‚Äù Mr. Johnson cast the non look-alikes Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo in the title roles. Even so, after the bodies and plot twists pile up, and after you‚Äôve scoped out the Bruce-ified downward curve of Mr. Gordon-Levitt‚Äôs nose and laughed when he worriedly touches his receding hairline, the movie starts getting its groove on. There‚Äôs a lot to get past, including an antediluvian divide between hard-charging men and decorative dames, including a stripper, Suzie (Piper Perabo), who works at a club called La Belle Aurore, the name of the Paris joint where Humphrey Bogart once met Ingrid Bergman. As time goes by, indeed, or as Mr. Johnson prefers, loops the loop. (Using some metaphysical shorthand he also alludes to the cosmic cup of coffee brewed by Jean-Luc Godard in ‚ÄúTwo or Three Things I Know About Her.‚Äù) Things, or rather the gender politics, improve once Joe, fleeing the outfit ‚Äî with his older self nearby ‚Äî takes refuge at a farmhouse belonging to Sara (an appealing Emily Blunt), a single mom with a strange little boy, Cid (an excellent Pierce Gagnon). There, Mr. Johnson settles into something deeper, swaps the banter for real feelings and wins you over. ‚ÄúLooper‚Äù is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Lots of gun deaths. Looper Opens on Friday nationwide.

After you've seen Looper, come back and listen to our Spoiler Special podcast with Dana Stevens and Dan Kois. You can also download the podcast. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slate‚Äôs movie critic. Looper is the third film from Rian Johnson, whose debut feature Brick (2005) somehow pulled off the brazen gimmick of setting a noir murder mystery in a suburban American high school. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (then known to most audiences as the alien kid on the family sitcom Third Rock from the Sun) played the lead role‚Äîa teenage Sam Spade investigating his girlfriend‚Äôs murder‚Äîwith an alchemically perfect combination of hip detachment and wary melancholy. Gordon-Levitt was already a rising actor, having been singled out by critics in less-mainstream roles, like the gay drifter he played in Gregg Araki‚Äôs moody, unforgettable Mysterious Skin. But it was only after Brick that he began his steady rise toward household-name status, playing a lovelorn greeting-card designer in (500) Days of Summer, a brain-cancer patient in 50/50, and a credible action sidekick in both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. I‚Äôm an avowed JGL fan, so the prospect of Gordon-Levitt and Johnson working together again was enticing. So was Looper‚Äôs high-concept sci-fi premise: Gordon-Levitt plays a hired assassin whose targets are sent back in time from the future. It‚Äôs 2044, and time travel hasn‚Äôt yet been invented, but‚Äîto employ the future-perfect tense useful mainly for time-travel movies‚Äîit will have been invented in 30 years. By that point, a fearful, vaguely post-apocalyptic government will have forbidden any use of the technology ... so, to paraphrase the NRA bumper sticker, when time machines are outlawed, only outlaws will have time machines. Soon the contraptions (which look, pleasingly, like Jules Verne-era bathyspheres) are used solely on the black market, transporting the human garbage of the future back in time for the past to clean up. At least, that's how Joe (Gordon-Levitt) justifies to himself the fact that he makes his living waiting in deserted fields for hooded, cuffed men to appear out of nowhere so he can shoot them with a blunderbuss. Advertisement Underground assassins like Joe‚Äîmembers of an organized force led by menacing boss-from-the-future Abe (Jeff Daniels)‚Äîare known as ‚Äúloopers,‚Äù for the chilling reason that, after being paid handsomely and given an early retirement that lasts exactly 30 years, they themselves will be captured, sent back in time and killed, thus closing the ‚Äúloop‚Äù of their lives. As the film begins, a new crime lord, a fearsome gangster known as the Rainmaker, has taken over in the future and is issuing new orders about the existing loopers: He wants all their future selves sent back in time and killed immediately, preferably by the younger versions of themselves. (Why exactly this setup would be desirable was one plot point among many that eluded me. Given that the victims from the future are being sent back with their heads covered, why would it matter which looper killed whom?) Get Slate in your inbox. Joe‚Äôs featherbrained fellow looper Seth (Paul Dano), encountering his own later-self, isn‚Äôt able to bring himself to pull the trigger, and the man gets away, resulting in a very bad outcome for both present and future Seths (and the first of several extended bursts of stomach-churning violence). Joe resolves that, when and if his own future self appears in cuffs before him, he won‚Äôt hesitate to blow him away‚Äîbut when that day comes and Joe‚Äôs future self turns out to be Bruce Willis, all bets are off. Future Joe manages to knock Past Joe out cold, take his gun, and head out into the world to find and kill the child destined one day to grow into the Rainmaker. Based on a tip about the super-criminal‚Äôs date and place of birth, old Joe has narrowed the candidates down to three small children, one of whom (Pierce Gagnon) is the son of a lonely sugarcane farmer (Emily Blunt) in whose barn young Joe has taken shelter while on the run from Abe‚Äôs men, who are now hunting down both Joes with extreme prejudice. You see where this is going: At some point, Young Joe and Old Joe are going to have to meet up and debrief about the 30 years that separate them, then decide whether they‚Äôre going to continue as allies or enemies. The moment this finally happens, in an Edward Hopper-esque diner in the middle of nowhere, was for me the movie‚Äôs high point. As they stare at each other in profile over two identical plates of steak and eggs, Willis and Gordon-Levitt, such different types both physically and temperamentally, make a strange sense as each others‚Äô time-traveling avatars, especially since we‚Äôre meant to imagine that Joe‚Äôs years of hard living to come will make him a coarser, tougher man in middle age. (Levitt was also fitted with facial prosthetics to make his fine-boned face more closely resemble Willis‚Äô craggier features. The nose works; the eyebrows are pushing it.) The diner scene also snaps with smart dialogue that playfully bats around sci-fi clich√©s; asked by his 2044 self to explicate one of the paradoxes of time travel, 2074 Joe impatiently dismisses the question, insisting they have no time to ‚Äústart making diagrams with straws.‚Äù Too bad, because a well-thought-out straw diagram might have been able to get me through the movie‚Äôs last half-hour, in which timeless philosophical questions of free will vs. destiny, nature vs. nurture, and utilitarian ethics (would you consider killing a child if you knew it meant saving countless future lives from the monster he might grow up to be?) get raised, then chucked aside as the story hurtles to a rushed, gory conclusion that leaves nearly as many plot holes as bullet holes. Saddest of all, after their juicy mid-movie encounter at the diner, Old and Young Joe hardly ever share the screen again, and when they do, it‚Äôs mostly to exchange terse remarks and gunfire. ||||| \\"Looper\\" is way inventive but it wears its creativity lightly, like it's no big deal. This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride. Written and directed by Rian Johnson and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, \\"Looper\\" demonstrates what a sharp and focused imagination can do when no one fences it in. Johnson gave us a taste of his ability in \\"Brick,\\" the 2005 Sundance film also starring Gordon-Levitt, but this is that promise fulfilled. Because its futuristic framework is so specific and so carefully worked out, \\"Looper's\\" world takes a while to outline in words. And it can be a challenge to follow the film's head-spinning narrative twists, such as having Gordon-Levitt and Willis sitting opposite each other in a riveting scene as the same man separated by 30 years of time. PHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments Keeping us involved are convincing work by actors who make us buy the unbelievable and Johnson's gift for smart, exhilarating filmmaking. He's a director with a natural flair for visual style (Steve Yedlin is the excellent cinematographer) and an ear for the kind of wised-up dialogue that almost allows Jeff Daniels, irresistible as an exasperated bad guy, to walk away with the picture. Perhaps the best thing about \\"Looper\\" is the feeling of uncertainty it conveys, the delicious sense that we are in only partially charted territory, that things can and will happen that are deeply unexpected. Despite the plot's unmistakable genre underpinnings, there's a surprising ruthlessness to what takes place here, the sense of a story that has the nerve to play by its own rules. \\"Looper\\" opens, typically as it turns out, with an arresting, unnerving scene. Gordon-Levitt's Joe is alone in an empty Kansas field, a large tarp carefully laid out in front of him, an imposing weapon known as a blunderbuss in his hands. Joe checks his watch and, right on schedule, a bound and hooded man materializes on the tarp. Joe kills him at once, removes the handful of silver ingots taped to the body that is his pay, disposes of the corpse and goes out to party, another day's work safely behind him. The year is 2044 and Joe is employed as a looper, a profession that takes some explaining. As Joe's voice-over reveals, time travel will be invented in 2074, then promptly banned. The only people who continue to use it, albeit clandestinely, are big-time organized criminals who, finding body disposal difficult in the future, hit on the idea of sending targets back in time 30 years and having specialized assassins kill them: \\"Taking out the future's garbage\\" is how the stoic Joe thinks about it, when he thinks about it at all. One of the quirks of the looping profession (likely named to reference time-travel theories involving causal loops) is that it is mandated that, at some point, you will end up unknowingly shooting the future version of yourself, an act called \\"closing your loop.\\" You will get a big payoff in gold ingots and go off to enjoy the last 30 years of your life. Joe's carefully segmented world ‚Äî which involves hanging with best friend and fellow looper Seth (an effective Paul Dano) and a dalliance with party girl Suzie (Piper Perabo), as well as constant use of a potent narcotic administered via eye drops ‚Äî is not fated to last. One afternoon Joe has the tarp ready for his next intended victim but everything goes wrong. Not only is the man not tied up, he's not hooded, and Joe immediately recognizes him as the older version of himself. Though Joe knows the dangers involved in not pulling the trigger, in doing what's called \\"letting your loop run,\\" circumstances conspire to enable old Joe (Willis) to escape. It's at this point that \\"Looper's\\" plot goes into overdrive. Though they are technically the same man, the difference in age means that Joe (Gordon-Levitt underwent extensive makeup changes to bolster the resemblance to Willis) and his older self have different dreams, different goals for their lives. What it says in the film's ad line ‚Äî \\"Hunted by your future, haunted by your past\\" ‚Äî turns out to be the truth. \\"Looper's\\" plot is way more complicated than you can imagine, and it couldn't hope to succeed without strong acting by all concerned, starting with Gordon-Levitt and a very committed Willis. Also doing potent work are Blunt as the inevitable woman of mystery and compelling child actor Pierce Gagnon as her self-possessed 10-year-old son, Cid. Best of all is Daniels, who gives an electric, eclectic performance as a man from the future fed up with living in the past. Because \\"Looper's\\" plot is hard to get your head around, the film also counts on its involving future world to keep us in the story. Working with production designer Ed Verreaux and cinematographer Yedlin, Johnson has created an interesting riff on the usual dystopian future by emphasizing elements, such as pervasive homeless encampments, that convincingly play like today's problems run amok. One of the memorable lines in Johnson's script has Daniels' gangster-from-the-future Abe casting a disparaging eye on Joe's style of dress and telling him, \\"The movies you are dressing like are just copying other movies.\\" The best thing about \\"Looper\\" is that it doesn't feel like it's copying anything at all. kenneth.turan@latimes.com 'Looper' MPAA rating: R, for strong violence, language, some sexuality/nudity and drug content Running time: 1 hour, 58 minutes Playing: In general release ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"\\"Looper\\" is a science-fiction film set in 2044 that puts a spin on the familiar figure of a troubled gun-for-hire while adding a fresh approach to genre material. The plot revolves around a contract killer, Joe, who works for an outfit that exists 30 years beyond 2044. Time travel exists and is illegal in this universe, and when the organization wants to dispose of a problem, they send the problem with a hood over their head into the past where a looper, like Joe, kills the victim. The twist emerges when the outfit sends back an older version of a looper, unknowingly killed by their younger self, which is how Joe ends up facing his middle-aged self, played by Bruce Willis. The film is filled with wit, smashing edits, and showy allusions, seamlessly spinning a fast-moving entertainment from its plot. The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt.

Stern; and the plot is written and directed by Rian Johnson."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning? Why isn't the Moon spinning? Why doesn't the Moon spin?","output":"While both questions convey a similar inquiry related to the motion of the Moon, they have slightly different meanings and nuances when examined more closely. The question \\"Why isn't the Moon spinning?\\" implies that the Moon is not spinning at all, which is not entirely accurate. The Moon does, in fact, spin on its axis. However, its rotation period (the time it takes for the Moon to complete one full rotation) is equal to its orbital period (the time it takes for the Moon to orbit Earth), which is approximately 27.3 days. As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, a phenomenon known as tidal locking or synchronous rotation. This question might be asking about why the Moon appears to not be spinning when observed from Earth or why it is tidal locked. On the other hand, \\"Why doesn't the Moon spin?\\" could be interpreted as a more general question about the rotational motion of the Moon. To clarify, the Moon does spin, as mentioned earlier. Asking why the Moon doesn't spin might imply that the person asking the question might not be aware that it spins and is instead looking for a more general explanation for the Moon's behavior and the circumstances that led to its current rotational state. To provide a comprehensive answer to both questions, it is important to discuss tidal locking and how it affects the Moon's rotation. The Moon's synchronous rotation is a result of the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. Over billions of years, gravitational forces have acted upon the Moon, eventually causing its rotation to slow down and become synchronous with its orbit around Earth. This process is known as tidal locking. Tidal locking occurs when the gravitational forces acting on a celestial body, like the Moon, create a slight bulge along the line connecting the center of the two interacting bodies ‚Äì in this case, the Moon and Earth. As the Moon rotates, this bulge attempts to align itself with Earth, creating a torque that slows down the Moon's rotation. Over time, the torque has caused the Moon's spin to gradually slow down, eventually leading to a state of equilibrium, when the duration of the Moon's rotation matches its orbital period. In summary, the Moon does spin and is tidal locked with Earth, meaning that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. While both questions inquire about the Moon's rotation, the first question (\\"Why isn't the Moon spinning?\\") can be understood as addressing the misconception regarding the Moon's lack of rotation, while the second question (\\"Why doesn't the Moon spin?\\") may be asking for a more general explanation about the Moon's motion. In both cases, answering the questions requires discussing the process of tidal locking and its impact on the Moon's rotation relative to Earth."},{"instruction":"What type of details about shamil khan can be gathered from the following bio?

The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC, which places them into five groups. Group 1 carcinogens definitely cause cancer in humans. Group 2A is probably carcinogenic to humans, Group 2B is possibly carcinogenic, the carcinogenicity of Group 3 in humans is unclassifiable, and Group 4 is probably not carcinogenic to humans. Only a little more than 100 are classified as Group 1 cancer-causing substances, including ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke. \\"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\\" the lARC's Dana Loomis said in a statement. \\"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\\" In 2010, lung cancer resulting from air pollution killed 223,000 people worldwide, and there was also convincing evidence that it increases the risk of bladder cancer, according to the IARC. Air pollution is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses, including respiratory and heart diseases. Air pollution is global, although the levels of it vary over space and time. Loomis said people in Asia, eastern North America, some places in Central America and Mexico, as well as North Africa have relatively high exposure. Developing countries with large populations and booming manufacturing sectors, such as China, are particularly at risk. Many cities in China, such as Beijing, frequently see smog.

To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read would be a bold understatement. Yet I never told him this. Why? Because in a world where films like \\"While She Was Out\\" can be green-lighted and attract an Oscar- winning star like Kim Basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell. As so many other reviewers have pointed out, \\"While She Was Out\\" is a dreadfully under-written Woman-in-Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a couple of things that struck me: 1) I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house IS a mess with toys. Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves? 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen. 3) Sure the film is stupid. But so are the countless \\"thrillers\\" I've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors. 4) I LOVED the ending! 5) Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase, I really DO think this film should be retitled \\"The Red Toolbox of Doom.\\" What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"This review has mixed feelings about the movie \\"While She Was Out.\\" The person who wrote the review thinks the movie has some problems, like weak dialogue, bad acting, and parts that don't make sense.

Plot title: Outbreak Movie plot: A virus called Motaba causing a deadly fever, is discovered in the African jungle in 1967. To keep the virus a secret, U.S. Army officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the army camp where soldiers were infected. In 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire. Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate. He and his crew√¢¬Ä¬îLieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt√¢¬Ä¬îgather information and return to the United States. Daniels asks his superior, (now) Brigadier General William Ford, to issue an alert but Ford tells Daniels the virus is unlikely to spread. Betsy, a white-headed capuchin monkey (a host species for the virus), is smuggled into the United States. When James \\"Jimbo\\" Scott√¢¬Ä¬îan employee of the Biotest animal-holding facility√¢¬Ä¬îsteals Betsy and brings her to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market, he is infected. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store owner who wanted a male for a customer. Rudy is also infected, and \\"Jimbo\\" releases the female monkey in the woods. He develops symptoms on a flight to Boston and infects his girlfriend, Alice. They are hospitalized, and Dr. Roberta Keough√¢¬Ä¬îa CDC scientist and Daniels' ex-wife√¢¬Ä¬îinvestigates their illness. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected. Technicians at a Cedar Creek hospital, including Henry, run tests on Rudy's blood; Henry is infected when he accidentally breaks a vial of Rudy's blood. It is later found that the virus mutated into a strain capable of spreading like influenza, and a number of people are exposed in a movie theater. Daniels learns about the infection and flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the host animal, the U.S. Army quarantines the town and imposes martial law. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle. Ford provides an experimental serum to treat the sick... My question: How does Salt create an antiserum? The answer to this question is:","output":"Major Salt creates an antiserum by using the antibodies found in Betsy, the white-headed capuchin monkey who is the host of the mutated Motaba virus. When the team identifies Betsy as the host animal, they manage to capture her and notice that she is not showing any symptoms of infection. They realize this is because the monkey has developed antibodies against the virus, making her immune. Salt extracts blood from Betsy and isolates the antibodies from her blood serum. By doing so, he formulates an antiserum to treat the infected people in Cedar Creek. This antiserum is then mass-produced and administered to the affected population, ultimately saving the town from the outbreak and preventing a nationwide epidemic of the deadly virus."},{"instruction":"The Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation began on 9 August 1945, with the Soviet invasion of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and was the last campaign of the Second World War and the largest of the 1945 Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War which resumed hostilities between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan after almost six years of peace.

Solve 236*x - 1583*x - 55876 = -9921 + 7925 for x.","output":"To solve the equation 236*x - 1583*x - 55876 = -9921 + 7925 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. We have two x terms on the left side: 236*x and -1583*x. Add these terms together: (236*-1) * x + (-1583 * x) = -1347*x On the right side of the equation, we have two constants: -9921 and 7925. Add these terms together: -9921 + 7925 = -1996 So the simplified equation is as follows: -1347*x - 55876 = -1996 Step 2: Isolate the x term. To isolate the x term, we want to move the constant -55876 from the left side of the equation to the right side. We can do that by adding 55876 to both sides of the equation: -1347*x - 55876 + 55876 = -1996 + 55876 -1347*x = 53880 Step 3: Solve for x. Now, we want to get x by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by -1347: x = 53880 / -1347 x ‚âà -40.00964 So the solution to the equation is x ‚âà -40.00964."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = The Plough, eatType = pub, food = Italian, priceRange = high, familyFriendly = yes, near = Caf√© Rouge.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Sati Context: The young Brahmin girl (Shabana Azmi) in this story has a disastrous horoscope. In an Indian village in 1828, this can be a real handicap. The fact that she is mute only compounds her difficulties. Her horoscope predicts that she will become a widow at an early age. If this turns out as predicted, in addition to being bad luck for her prospective husbands, it is bad luck for her, as she will, according to the customs of the time, have to commit suttee, sati. That means she will have to be burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. To avoid this fate, her family has hit upon the appealing strategem of having her marry a banyan tree. Answer:","output":"The movie \\"Sati\\" is set in an Indian village in the year 1828. This period is significant due to the cultural and traditional customs practiced in India during that time. The story revolves around a young Brahmin girl who faces considerable challenges due to her unfavorable horoscope and muteness. The fear of her becoming a widow early in life and the threat of her having to commit suttee, or sati, further adds to the struggles she experiences. Sati, a traditional Hindu practice, was the act of a widow immolating herself on her deceased husband's funeral pyre. This was believed to be an act of devotion and loyalty to one's husband, often resulting in the widow's glorification. However, sati was a controversial and inhumane practice that has been abolished and criminalized in modern India. The movie's setting in a rural Indian village highlights the traditional beliefs and superstitions that governed the lives of people in that era. The plot explores how the protagonist's family goes to great lengths to ensure her safety by attempting to marry her to a banyan tree. This unusual solution is a reflection of the extent to which people were willing to conform to societal norms to save their loved ones. In conclusion, the movie \\"Sati\\" is set in a remote Indian village in 1828. The story portrays the challenges faced by a young Brahmin girl due to her horoscope and muteness, and her family's desperate attempts to save her from a horrendous fate. The harsh realities of the Hindu tradition of sati are also depicted, providing a vivid illustration of the customs and beliefs prevalent in early 19th century India."},{"instruction":"What makes food from co and h 2?

Anton Grigorevich Rubinshteyn; November 28 [O.S. November 16] 1829 - November 20 [O.S. November 8] 1894) was a Russian pianist, composer and conductor who became a pivotal figure in Russian culture when he founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He was the elder brother of Nikolai Rubinstein who founded the Moscow Conservatory. As a pianist, Rubinstein ranks among the great 19th-century keyboard virtuosos. Rubinstein was born to Jewish parents in the village of Vikhvatinets in the Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire (now known as Ofatinti in Transnistria, Republic of Moldova), on the Dniestr River, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) northwest of Odessa. Before he was 5 years old, his paternal grandfather ordered all members of the Rubinstein family to convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy. Although he was raised as a Christian, Rubinstein would later return to being atheist. Rubinstein's father opened a pencil factory in Moscow. His mother, a competent musician, began giving him piano lessons at five, until the teacher Alexander Villoing heard and accepted Rubinstein as a non-paying student. Rubinstein made his first public appearance at a charity benefit concert at the age of nine. Later that year Rubinstein's mother sent him, accompanied by Villoing, to Paris where he sought unsuccessfully to enroll at the Paris Conservatoire. Rubinstein and Villoing remained in Paris for a year. In December 1840, Rubinstein played in the Salle Erard for an audience that included Frederic Chopin and Franz Liszt. Chopin invited Rubinstein to his studio and played for him. Liszt advised Villoing to take him to Germany to study composition; however, Villoing took Rubinstein on an extended concert tour of Europe and Western Russia. They finally returned to Moscow in June 1843. Determined to raise money to further the musical careers of both Anton and his younger brother Nikolai, their mother sent Rubinstein and Villoing on a tour of Russia, following which the brothers were dispatched to Saint Petersburg to play for Tsar Nicholas I and the Imperial family at the Winter Palace. Anton was 14 years old; Nikolai was eight. By 1867, ongoing tensions with the Balakirev camp, along with related matters, led to intense dissension within the Conservatory's faculty. Rubinstein resigned and returned to touring throughout Europe. Unlike his previous tours, he began increasingly featuring the works of other composers. In previous tours, Rubinstein had played primarily his own works. At the behest of the Steinway & Sons piano company, Rubinstein toured the United States during the 1872-3 season. Steinway's contract with Rubinstein called on him to give 200 concerts at the then unheard-of rate of 200 dollars per concert (payable in gold--Rubinstein distrusted both United States banks and United States paper money), plus all expenses paid. Rubinstein stayed in America 239 days, giving 215 concerts--sometimes two and three a day in as many cities. Rubinstein wrote of his American experience, May Heaven preserve us from such slavery! Under these conditions there is no chance for art--one simply grows into an automaton, performing mechanical work; no dignity remains to the artist; he is lost.... The receipts and the success were invariably gratifying, but it was all so tedious that I began to despise myself and my art. So profound was my dissatisfaction that when several years later I was asked to repeat my American tour, I refused pointblank... Despite his misery, Rubinstein made enough money from his American tour to give him financial security for the rest of his life. Upon his return to Russia, he \\"hastened to invest in real estate\\", purchasing a dacha in Peterhof, not far from Saint Petersburg, for himself and his family. Villoing had worked with Rubinstein on hand position and finger dexterity. From watching Liszt, Rubinstein had learned about freedom of arm movement. Theodor Leschetizky, who taught piano at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory when it opened, likened muscular relaxation at the piano to a singer's deep breathing. He would remark to his students about \\"what deep breaths Rubinstein used to take at the beginning of long phrases, and also what repose he had and what dramatic pauses.\\" In his book The Great Pianists, former New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg describes Rubinstein's playing as that \\"of extraordinary breadth, virility and vitality, immense sonority and technical grandeur in which all too often technical sloppiness asserted itself.\\" When caught up in the moment of performance, Rubinstein did not seem to care how many wrong notes he played as long as his conception of the piece he was playing came through. Rubinstein himself admitted, after a concert in Berlin in 1875, \\"If I could gather up all the notes that I let fall under the piano, I could give a second concert with them.\\" Part of the problem might have been the sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many observers commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger \\"was as thick as my thumb--think of it! Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. It was a wonderful hand.\\" Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as \\"fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once.\\" The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: \\"Nothing cramped about him! He spreads his hands as if he were going to take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!\\" Because of the slap-dash moments in Rubinstein's playing, some more academic, polished players, especially German-trained ones, seriously questioned Rubinstein's greatness. Those who valued interpretation as much or more than pure technique found much to praise. Pianist and conductor Hans von Bulow called Rubinstein \\"the Michelangelo of music.\\" The German critic Ludwig Rellstab called him \\"the Hercules of the piano; the Jupiter Tonans of the instrument.\\" Did he enroll somewhere else?","output":"Yes, Anton Rubinstein did enroll somewhere else after not being able to join the Paris Conservatoire. He continued to learn piano from his teacher, Alexander Villoing. Villoing took him for an extended concert tour across Europe and Western Russia before they returned to Moscow in June 1843. Then, Rubinstein and his brother Nikolai were sent to Saint Petersburg to play for Tsar Nicholas I and the Imperial family at the Winter Palace. Over time, Rubinstein gained more knowledge, experience, and recognition, eventually becoming a pivotal figure in Russian culture when he founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Laura can leave at 2.

Despite the financial turmoil, this ancient city has evolved into a haven for the creative, adventurous, and sophisticated crowd, providing a breath of fresh air in an otherwise grim situation. In this article, we explore how Athens has risen above the challenges and emerged as a destination for the modern, urban lifestyle. The Economic Crisis and Athens When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Greece, already tangled in high levels of debt, found itself at the epicenter of the European economic turmoil. From sky-high unemployment rates to relentless austerity measures, Greek citizens faced challenging times, with the capital city of Athens becoming the symbol of this suffering. The economic collapse that ensued resulted in widespread hardship and social disillusionment. Coming of Age: A New Movement Emerges In the face of adversity, the Athenian spirit of resilience coupled with the enterprising mindset of its people birthed a cultural renaissance. Athens' young entrepreneurs, designers, and artists turned a dire economic situation into an opportunity to forge a dynamic and creative path. Out of the ashes of the economic disaster rose a lifestyle district that rivaled those of other global cities such as New York, London, and Paris. Athens' Revitalized Cityscape The transformation of Athens can be witnessed in its bustling cityscape, characterized by fashionable cafes, eclectic bars, contemporary art galleries, and vibrant street art. These trendy hotspots, frequented by fashion-conscious Athenians and tourists alike, have breathed new life into the city's once-drab streets. The city's thriving culinary scene is another testament to Athens' rejuvenation. Local chefs meld traditional Greek cuisine with innovative twists, resulting in a gastronomic boom that tantalizes both taste buds and helps set the city apart as an emerging food lover‚Äôs destination. Cocktail Bars and Nightlife Athens' nightlife has flourished in lockstep with the city's rejuvenation, with an eclectic mix of bars and clubs catering to all tastes. From intimate rooftop bars that promise patrons a taste of unparalleled romanticism, to underground speakeasies oozing mystery and allure, the city's late-night scene continues to leave visitors dazzled. And though Athens‚Äô nightlife may be steeped in a relaxed Mediterranean ambience, its rich offerings promise to outdo those of many international metropolitan cities. The Effects of the Transformation The metamorphosis of Athens from a city ravaged by the economic crisis to a vibrant and trendy metropolis has had profound socio-economic implications. As more people flock to the city's fashionable establishments, a sense of solidarity emerges among the afflicted, allowing Athenians to rebuild their lives and their city in style and elegance. Moreover, the renewed interest in the city has propelled tourism, infusing much-needed funds into the beleaguered economy. As a result, new jobs have been created, providing opportunities for the unemployed young Athenians ‚Äì the early architects behind the reimagined city. In Conclusion In the face of an economic catastrophe, Athens has risen, phoenix-like, from the financial wreckage of its recent past. The creative transformations in the city's culinary, nightlife, and art scenes have propelled this ancient urban center into the modern age, positioning it as a vibrant destination for young and stylish patrons. With its intoxicating mixture of history, culture, and cutting-edge creativity, Athens now stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, offering a rich and satisfying experience for locals and tourists alike to savor."},{"instruction":"1.

Article: Many children would start school hungry without breakfast clubs, teachers have claimed. A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: \\"Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. \\"Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time.

If the coffee shop is open 5 hours a day every single day, how many coffee cups are brewed in 1 week?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Sure, let's break it down step by step. 1. First, let's calculate the number of coffee cups brewed on weekdays: The coffee shop brews 10 coffee cups per hour on a weekday and is open for 5 hours a day.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of coffee cups brewed on weekdays is: 50 coffee cups/day * 5 days = 250 coffee cups. 3. Next, let's look at the weekend: The coffee shop brews 120 coffee cups in total over the weekend. 4. Finally, let's calculate the total number of coffee cups brewed in a week: Total coffee cups on weekdays + Total coffee cups on weekends = Total coffee cups in a week. 250 coffee cups (weekdays) + 120 coffee cups (weekend) = 370 coffee cups in 1 week.

It is crucial to understanding how the war impacted civilian life in the Confederate states, which experienced large-scale invasion and military occupation by the Union forces. Notably, though, not all Confederate towns fell prey to Union advances. This article examines the question: How many Confederate towns were not occupied by Union forces at any point during the American Civil War? Defining Occupation Assessing how many Confederate towns were not occupied requires a proper understanding of occupation. In the context of the Civil War, it is generally defined as a town‚Äôs military seizure under enemy control for an extended period. This process allowed the Union to suppress the Confederacy‚Äôs resources and infrastructure. It's important to note that the occasional presence of Union raiders or scouts on the outskirts of a settlement wouldn't have constituted as an occupation. Gauging the Number of Unoccupied Confederate Towns Estimating the precise number of Confederate towns untouched by Union forces is a daunting challenge. The documentation from the time is imperfect, and factors like a town's size and strategic significance played critical roles in whether an area witnessed Union occupation. Furthermore, the dynamic and complex nature of the war makes it difficult to pinpoint every settlement that entirely escaped Union control. Nonetheless, some historical records illuminate and analyze prominent Confederate towns that evaded occupation. Examining these sources provides a deeper understanding of regional differences in occupation and their bearing on the overall conflict. Notable Unoccupied Confederate Settlements While Union forces succeeded in capturing major Confederate cities like Atlanta, Richmond, and New Orleans, a few towns managed to escape the clutches of war. These settlements were typically small, isolated, and strategically negligible, allowing them to shelter from Union advances. Remarkably, several towns that eluded Union forces throughout the war include: 1. Sardis, Tennessee: Situated in a secluded area of southwestern Tennessee, Sardis remained largely undisturbed due to its relatively unsophisticated transportation networks and absence of military targets. 2. Anderson, South Carolina: Although South Carolina saw substantial military activity, Anderson's unassuming position toward the western part of the state spared it from direct Union involvement. 3. Union Springs, Alabama: Despite its central location in Alabama, Union Springs emerged from the war unscathed due to nearby swamps that discouraged Union forces from establishing control. 4. Tallulah, Louisiana: Owing to its remote location in northeast Louisiana, Tallulah evaded the Union's grasp while significant cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge succumbed to military occupation. 5. Kosse, Texas: Far from the primary battlefronts in the eastern Confederate states, the seclusion of Texas towns such as Kosse contributed to their overall safety. The towns listed above represent just a fraction of Confederate settlements that successfully avoided Union occupation, illustrating the complex wartime experiences on a regional and local scale. Conclusion In answering the question, \\"How many Confederate towns were not occupied by Union forces at any point?\\" the explanation is perhaps best approached as an historical exploration rather than a definitive count. It is crucial to consider how factors such as population size, geographic location, and infrastructure influenced the likelihood of occupation. Through examining notable settlements that managed to escape Union control, it becomes clear that the experiences of individual Confederate towns varied greatly during the American Civil War. Although it may be impossible to present an exact number, the reality of those towns that averted occupation offers a distinct perspective on the era's complexities and the resilience of its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: yellow bathtub adds a hint of freshness to the tropical bathroom","output":"In the given sentence, \\"yellow bathtub adds a hint of freshness to the tropical bathroom,\\" the most important words are: 1.

He writes: \\"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of \\"proof\\" according the Quran being \\"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \\"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\\" which inhibit a \\"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\\" of the Quran's message.

Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature ‚Äì the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. Paragraph: Scientists are observing two of the same gases at different temperatures. They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gas is at a lower temperature?","output":"Based on the kinetic-molecular theory and the given paragraph, Gas B is at a lower temperature. The theory states that the higher the temperature, the faster the gas molecules move.

Lamar. In 1839, during Lamar's presidency, a committee composed of Thomas W. Ward, John W. Moore, A.C. Horton, and Alexander H. Phillips was tasked with scouting and recommending potential sites for the new capital. At that time, the capital had been temporarily located in various places, including Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco, and Columbia. The Texas Congress had decided to establish a more permanent capital, centrally located in the territory to serve the citizens better and provide a stronger sense of unity. The committee, under Lamar's instructions, eventually arrived at the small settlement known as Waterloo, located along the Colorado River's northern bank. Waterloo was inhabited by a small number of pioneers, who had built their community on the riverbanks in a territory teeming with natural resources like timber, fertile soil, and abundant water supply. The location's relative safety from Mexican military incursions, river access, and strategic importance also made Waterloo an ideal choice. The Waterloo recommendation was based on the location's potential to support a growing population, serve as a regional economic hub, and provide a solid foundation for the Republic of Texas's ongoing political development. The selection process included the consideration of factors such as geography, transportation links, availability of resources, and ease of defense. Once the committee decided on Waterloo, they presented their recommendation to the Texas Congress. After approving the selection, the Congress planned the new capital's layout and construction. The capital was named Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, an important figure in Texas history and known as the \\"Father of Texas.\\" On August 1, 1839, the Congress passed the act to purchase the Waterloo site and declared it to be Austin, the new capital of Texas. President Lamar played a significant role in the decision to establish the capital in Austin and saw it as a way to consolidate Texas' territories and promote growth and stability. In conclusion, the suggestion to make Waterloo the permanent capital of Texas came from a commission appointed by Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar, with Thomas W. Ward, John W. Moore, A.C. Horton, and Alexander H. Phillips as the leading representatives in scouting and recommending potential sites. The selection of Waterloo, later named Austin, became a turning point in Texas's history and laid the groundwork for a prosperous and thriving city that has continued to evolve through the years."},{"instruction":"Which former lawyer and entrepreneur who was convicted for conspiracy and drug dealing was involved in a civil suit against Bill and Hillary Clinton? Answer:","output":"The former lawyer and entrepreneur who was convicted for conspiracy and drug dealing and was involved in a civil suit against Bill and Hillary Clinton is Dan Lasater. Dan Lasater, born February 13, 1944, in Indianapolis, Indiana, was an American businessman and bond broker who became embroiled in a number of legal issues during the 1980s and 1990s. Dan Lasater's early career saw him practicing law as an attorney, but he later transitioned into the business world. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lasater founded Ponderosa Steakhouse, a popular restaurant chain, and Lasater & Company, a bond brokerage firm. With his extensive knowledge in finance, he quickly became successful in these enterprises. However, during the mid-1980s, his fortunes took a turn for the worse. In 1986, Lasater was indicted for conspiracy involving the distribution of narcotics. The main charge against him was providing cocaine to various individuals, including key political figures in Arkansas. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison for his crimes. One of the most notable aspects of Dan Lasater's legal troubles was his association with Bill Clinton, who was the Governor of Arkansas at the time. It is believed that Lasater had connections to the Clinton family, as Bill had appointed Lasater's half-brother, Phillip Loyd Dockery, to the Arkansas Medical Services Commission in 1983. Additionally, Lasater had made generous campaign contributions to Clinton and provided the usage of his private jet to Bill and Hillary Clinton for personal and political trips. In the years that followed, Lasater would be involved in a civil suit against Bill and Hillary Clinton, largely due to his alleged connections to them. The suit claimed that the Clintons had engaged in criminal misconduct, which included drug smuggling and money laundering. However, no direct evidence was found, and ultimately, the civil suit was dismissed by a federal judge. The allegations tarnished the Clintons' reputation and contributed to conspiracy theories involving their supposed corruption and illegal activities. Dan Lasater's story exemplifies the intertwining of politics, business, and criminal activities during the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. It remains a cautionary tale of the consequences of such involvement for all parties concerned."},{"instruction":"Question: It was a popular and common gift this year, so he headed to the what where it would be easy to find?

Cage claimed the commission should not have sought to block its funding. The High Court case judge called for proper discussions in future to avoid wasting taxpayer and charity money. The case was brought by Cage and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. Cage's research director Asim Qureshi claimed in February that former London student Emwazi - identified as the man in a number of Islamic State beheading videos - had been driven to extremism after UK security services harassed him. Cage later said it had made \\"mistakes\\" in its comments about Emwazi, a former client.

If you're feeling down, try smiling for at least 30 seconds to see if it helps boost your mood a little. You might even try smiling in the mirror and making silly faces ‚Äî you might even get yourself laughing. Redecorating can help you feel as though you're making a fresh start. You can do this even if you don't have any money, simply by rearranging your room, or giving it a thorough clean and getting rid of things you no longer need. Cover your walls with things that inspire you ‚Äî for example, pictures of places you'd like to visit, or people who inspire you or make you feel happy. Find your favourite photo of you and someone (or some people) you love. If it's not already printed out, print it and frame it, and put it in a prominent place in your home. Take some alone time once in a while and treat yourself. Buy yourself that book you've been wanting to read. Take a few hours to sit in a comfy chair and read it while sipping your favourite tea. Have a bath in epsom salts and put on a nice moisturizer on afterward. Have a spa day. If you feel uncomfortable in your body, you'll likely have trouble enjoying yourself. Try doing daily exercises like looking in the mirror and naming 5 things you love about yourself ‚Äî not 5 things you hate. If you can't name 5, name as many as you can.

Allow yourself a few moments of distracted enjoyment as often as you can ‚Äî no matter how bad you feel or how much you feel you may not deserve it.","output":"This article highlights the importance of emotional well-being and provides several strategies for enhancing mood and overall happiness. It is suggested that facial expressions, such as smiling and frowning, can impact one's emotions. To boost mood, try smiling for 30 seconds or making funny faces in the mirror to induce laughter. Redecorating or rearranging one's living space can give a sense of fresh start and improve mood. Displaying inspiring images, such as pictures of dream destinations or people who bring happiness, can further elevate emotions. Framing a cherished photograph of loved ones and placing it in a prominent location serves as a reminder of positive relationships. Practicing self-care by scheduling alone time to indulging in activities like reading a desired book, sipping favorite tea, or taking a relaxing bath can also benefit emotional health. Engaging in daily self-love exercises, such as listing personal qualities one appreciates and gradually increasing the number of positive attributes identified, helps build self-esteem and counteract negative thoughts. Generosity has been shown to activate the same brain regions as gift-receiving. Performing good deeds, such as volunteering or assisting others, can improve mood and overall well-being. Examples include helping a friend or neighbor with household tasks or volunteering for a meaningful cause. Finally, allowing oneself to participate in enjoyable, distracting activities ‚Äì like dancing, singing, or cleaning ‚Äì can provide temporary relief from negative emotions. Incorporating these strategies into daily life can contribute to a more positive outlook and enhanced emotional well-being, recognizing that everyone is beautiful and unique in their own way."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere - Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere is a 1960 Hindi movie.

Fact 2: Bromeliads and cacti are xerophytes. Given the two facts above, what type of environment is a cacti adapted to? Possible answers: --cool; --Wet; --Dry; --arid; --Dark; --H20; --soil; --Cold; The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Dry and arid environments. Given Fact 1, we know that xerophytes are plants adapted to very dry environments. Fact 2 informs us that both bromeliads and cacti are considered xerophytes. From these facts, we can conclude that cacti are adapted to environments that are dry and arid. Cacti have various adaptations that allow them to survive in such conditions. For instance, they possess thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling them to endure long periods without rainfall. Additionally, their shallow root systems spread out in a wide radius to efficiently absorb any available moisture. Furthermore, many cacti have spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration. These spines also provide shade to the plant's surface, helping to moderate its temperature in the intense desert heat. It is important to note that while cacti are well-suited to dry and arid environments, they can also be found in a variety of other habitats, such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and forests. However, their most iconic association is with the desert, where their unique adaptations provide them with a competitive advantage over other plants that struggle to survive in such challenging conditions. To recap, based on the facts provided‚Äîxerophytes being plants adapted to dry environments, and cacti being xerophytes‚Äîit is evident that cacti are adapted to dry and arid environments."},{"instruction":"If your evening meal isn't served on a dish, at what kind of eatery are you eating?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that if fewer satellites are needed, it would lead to more or faster erosion of rocks, is not directly related to the primary processes of rock erosion. The processes you have mentioned, such as water freezing and expansion, clay expansion, and plant roots penetrating rocks, are all natural processes that occur on Earth and contribute to rock erosion. These processes depend on environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, and the presence of certain organisms, rather than the number of satellites in orbit. However, we can consider if there is any potential indirect effect of fewer satellites on the erosion of rocks. Satellites are used for a variety of purposes, including studying Earth's environment, monitoring climate change, and observing natural phenomena. If fewer satellites are needed, it might be due to advancements in technology, allowing for more efficient and effective data collection, or it could be due to a decline in interest or funding for satellite-based research. If the reduction in the number of satellites leads to a decrease in the availability or quality of environmental data, it might have an unintended indirect effect on our understanding and monitoring of the processes that drive rock erosion. For example, satellites can monitor changes in ice coverage and the impact of climate change, which might have implications for how water freezing and expanding contributes to rock erosion. Similarly, satellites can help monitor vegetation and how it interacts with rocks, providing insights into the role of plants in the erosion process. In a scenario where less satellite data is available, it could become more challenging to study and understand the processes leading to rock erosion, which could hinder our ability to predict and manage the effects of erosion on infrastructure, ecosystems, and Earth's landscape. Although the direct effect of fewer satellites on the speed or extent of rock erosion is minimal, the indirect impact on research and understanding of erosion processes could be significant. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests fewer satellites could lead to more or faster erosion of rocks does not have a direct effect on the natural processes contributing to rock erosion. However, there could be indirect effects on our ability to monitor, study, and understand these natural processes, which might impact our ability to manage and predict the consequences of rock erosion. These indirect effects would be highly dependent on the reasons for needing fewer satellites, as well as the advancements in technology or research efforts supporting our understanding of erosion processes."},{"instruction":"\\" Harry 's eyes are nice . \\" \\" I 'm so glad Seamus asked me right away , \\" Lavender sighed . \\" I think I might have a crush on him . \\" As Parvati and Lavender collapsed into giggles , Hermione once again thought how annoying the pair of them could be at times .

Premise: \\"Two men touch their heads together and smile.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Men press their heads against one another.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements in the premise and hypothesis. - In the premise, the key elements are \\"two men\\", \\"touch their heads together\\" and \\"smile\\". - In the hypothesis, the key elements are \\"men\\" and \\"press their heads against one another\\". Step 2: Compare the key elements between the premise and hypothesis. - Both the premise and hypothesis mention \\"men\\" which is a common element. - The action of touching heads together in the premise and pressing heads against one another in the hypothesis are similar, but could potentially have different interpretations. \\"Touching\\" can imply a gentle and brief contact, while \\"pressing\\" might suggest applying force or maintaining contact for a longer duration. Step 3: Evaluate if the key elements in the hypothesis are entailed by the key elements in the premise. - The premise states that two men touch their heads together and smile, which is a specific event. This suggests there is positive contact between the men involving their heads. - The hypothesis describes a potential interpretation of the head contact. While pressing heads against one another could be a reinterpretation of touching heads together, there might be slight variations in the intensity and duration of the contact. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. - The hypothesis, which claims that men press their heads against one another, is partially entailed by the premise. The premise supports the idea that the men are in contact with their heads, but it does not clearly specify that they are pressing their heads with force or for a longer duration. Conclusion: The hypothesis is partially entailed by the premise, as the premise does describe an event where men are touching their heads together. However, due to the potential difference in the intensity and duration of the contact between \\"touching\\" and \\"pressing,\\" it cannot be definitively concluded that the hypothesis is completely entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

As a composer Holst was frequently inspired by literature. He set poetry by Thomas Hardy and Robert Bridges and, a particular influence, Walt Whitman, whose words he set in \\"Dirge for Two Veterans\\" and The Mystic Trumpeter (1904). He wrote an orchestral Walt Whitman Overture in 1899. While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had read some of Max M√ºller's books, which inspired in him a keen interest in Sanskrit texts, particularly the Rig Veda hymns. He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing, and decided to make his own translations, despite his lack of skills as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at University College, London, to study the language.Imogen commented on his translations: \\"He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem na√Øve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be 'clear and dignified' and that would 'lead the listener into another world'\\". His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included Sita (1899‚Äì1906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the Ramayana (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher Tito Ricordi); Savitri (1908), a chamber opera based on a tale from the Mahabharata; four groups of Hymns from the Rig Veda (1908‚Äì14); and two texts originally by KƒÅlidƒÅsa: Two Eastern Pictures (1909‚Äì10) and The Cloud Messenger (1913).Towards the end of the nineteenth century, British musical circles had experienced a new interest in national folk music. Some composers, such as Sullivan and Elgar, remained indifferent, but Parry, Stanford, Stainer and Alexander Mackenzie were founding members of the Folk-Song Society. Parry considered that by recovering English folk song, English composers would find an authentic national voice; he commented, \\"in true folk-songs there is no sham, no got-up glitter, and no vulgarity\\". Vaughan Williams was an early and enthusiastic convert to this cause, going round the English countryside collecting...

Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows ‚Äì \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy ‚Äì but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions.
