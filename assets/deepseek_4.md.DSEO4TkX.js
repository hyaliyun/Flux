The teenagers were shot dead by police outside the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray where they had killed Father Jacques Hamel, 86, and taken hostages. So-called Islamic State (IS) released a video of what it said were the two men pledging allegiance to the group. \\"Following DNA tests, it emerged that the terrorist has been identified as Abdel Malik Nabil Petitjean,\\" a source in the Paris prosecutor's office said. Petitjean, from a town in eastern France, had been on a watch list as a potential security threat since June after trying to enter Syria from Turkey. He had been harder than Kermiche to identify because his body was badly disfigured in the police shooting, but officers found an ID card belonging to him in Kermiche's home and confirmed his identity in a DNA match with his mother. After Petitjean was named, his mother, Yamina, denied he could have been the killer. \\"I know my kid, he is kind. I did not produce a devil. He never talked about IS,\\" she told BFM television.

Amaq news agency, the media arm of IS, later released a second video of Petitjean, this time speaking alone and threatening France. French media have reported sources close to the investigation as saying anti-terrorism police had been searching for a man in the days before the attack who \\"strongly resembled\\" Petitjean, after receiving a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency about an imminent attack. A photograph of the man said to be planning the attack had been supplied but not his name. Kermiche, also 19, was being monitored by police and was wearing a surveillance tag at the time of the attack. He was arrested twice last year trying to reach Syria and was awaiting trial for alleged membership of a terrorist organisation. It is being reported that Kermiche sent out audio messages on social media proclaiming his intention of carrying out an attack, days before the pair struck. Sent to about 200 followers on the messaging service Telegram, the messages were encrypted and never reached the eyes or ears of French intelligence, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports. The French government has faced strong criticism from political opponents over perceived security failings since the Bastille Day lorry attack in Nice two weeks ago in which more than 80 people died. President Francois Hollande has said France will form a National Guard from reserve forces, in an attempt to prevent further attacks. He has urged \\"patriots\\" to sign up to become reservists and has said parliamentary consultations on forming the Guard will take place in September \\"so this force can be created as fast as possible to protect the French\\". The comments came two days after Kermiche and Petitjean stormed the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, a suburb of Rouen, during morning Mass. They slit the throat of the elderly priest before being killed by police. One of four people taken hostage - said to be an elderly parishioner - suffered severe knife wounds. Prosecutor Francois Molins said the attackers had been carrying a \\"fake explosive device covered in aluminium foil\\" along with hand-held weapons when they entered the Catholic church. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the identification of Abdel Malik Nabil Petitjean, one of the attackers involved in the killing of Father Jacques Hamel and taking hostages at the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, France. It provides details about Petitjean's background, including his appearance on a watch list as a potential security threat due to his attempt to enter Syria from Turkey. The article also mentions the Islamic State (IS) claiming responsibility for the attack and releasing a video of the two attackers pledging allegiance to the group.

Birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be molted. The timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation. How do birds store energy?","output":"Birds store energy primarily through the accumulation of fat in their bodies, which serves as a critical energy reserve during migration. This enables them to have enough energy to sustain them during their long and often strenuous journeys. Fat deposits are built up by consuming a surplus of food and nutrients in the weeks or even months leading up to migration. These fat stores are then tapped into and metabolized as the bird requires extra energy to fuel its flight. In addition to fat accumulation, some physiological adaptations can help birds regulate their energy use more efficiently during migration, such as controlling sleep patterns in nocturnal migrants. Behavioral changes, like flying in flocks, can also help to reduce the energy expenditure required for migration by taking advantage of aerodynamic benefits and minimizing the individual bird's exertion. Overall, the combination of accumulating fat reserves, physiological adaptations, and behavioral changes allows birds to effectively store and manage energy for successful migration."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. But I can use this background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. What is an answer for this question: In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? A:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's analyze the background information provided and apply it to the different cases of the African Buffalo herd sizes. The dilution effect suggests that group living evolves because of the benefits to individual animals, rather than the group as a whole. As the group size increases, each individual's risk of being attacked decreases. This is illustrated in the examples provided, such as fish shoaling, Camargue horses, and water striders. Now, let's consider the African Buffalo cases: - Case A: Buffaloes living in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds - Case B: Buffaloes living in a small herd In case A, the individual buffaloes are part of a large herd, which would dilute their individual risk of attack. The overall benefit for the group in terms of reducing the risk of predation for each individual would be higher in this case. In case B, the individual buffaloes are part of a smaller herd. This would result in a higher individual risk of attack compared to case A since the dilution effect is less pronounced in smaller groups. As the question asks which scenario would result in less benefit for the group as a whole, it would be more appropriate to consider case B. In this situation, the smaller group size provides less benefit from the dilution effect compared to case A, where the larger group size would provide more significant benefits to individual buffaloes in terms of reduced risk of predation."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: basket, bread, isolate","output":"Step 1: Identify the main concepts - basket, bread, and isolate.

By Victoria Woollaston PUBLISHED: 09:02 EST, 30 October 2013 | UPDATED: 12:25 EST, 30 October 2013 Popular building game Minecraft already lets users create their own worlds, but a new 3D gaming map now lets them explore the whole of the UK and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens. Minecraft Britain was built using Ordnance Survey maps of the UK as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game. It covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland Great Britain and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres. To help players navigate the interactive world, Ordnance Survey has published a list of coordinates to various OPTIONS: - 3D location, available inside the game - Great Britain location, available inside the game - Minecraft location, available inside the game - Minecraft Britain location, available inside the game - Ordnance Survey location, available inside the game - UK location, available inside the game - Victoria Woollaston location, available inside the game","output":"Ending Option: Great Britain location, available inside the game In this ending, players from all across the Great Britain band together to create a virtual build-a-thon in an effort to showcase the country's historical and cultural landmarks. The Minecraft Britain map becomes a hub for enthusiasts to celebrate their favorite places and share their creations with the world. To give the project a sense of continuity and purpose, the builders come together to form a Minecraft Britain Council. The council consists of representatives from each region, who are responsible for overseeing the design, construction, and maintenance of their respective areas. This ensures that all builds accurately reflect the unique characteristics, history, and culture of each locale. As more and more people become involved in the project, Minecraft Britain rapidly evolves into an immersive and educational experience. Schools begin to incorporate the game into their curriculum as a valuable learning tool, encouraging students to actively participate in rebuilding iconic landmarks and experimenting with architectural styles from different periods of British history. Furthermore, a weekly \\"Spotlight on Britain\\" series is introduced, highlighting impressive new builds and the stories behind the builders. These talented individuals and their creations soon become a point of pride for their local communities, inspiring others to explore and learn more about their shared history. Tourism boards take notice of Minecraft Britain's popularity and the renewed interest in local culture that it has ignited. They work with the Minecraft Britain Council to create a new initiative aimed at boosting tourism by developing digital and physical experiences centered around the game's virtual landscape. In collaboration with Ordnance Survey, a program is launched that rewards players with real-world souvenirs and discounts to local attractions when they explore and create within the Minecraft Britain map. The ongoing success of the project sparks interest from other countries, who explore creating maps of their own national heritage in Minecraft. By the time the project reaches its final and most ambitious milestone, the entire UK has come together to create a living, constantly evolving, and interactive representation of their homeland, with each block telling a story of the people, places, and history that make up Great Britain. Minecraft Britain is recognized as a global phenomenon and becomes a symbol of unity, creativity, and the shared spirit of innovation. In this story's ending, the Minecraft Britain map has a profound impact on both the virtual and real worlds. By bridging the gap between the digital and physical spaces, the citizens of Great Britain come together to create connections, forge relationships, and learn from one another – all within a virtual landscape that represents their shared heritage."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and your task is to generate the name of the category of the product based on the review given by the user.

The street acquired its name from Sir George Downing, who was a statesman and diplomat during the reigns of King Charles II and King James II. He constructed the street in the 1680s, and it has since become synonymous with the Prime Minister and the government of the United Kingdom. 10 Downing Street has been the official residence for British Prime Ministers since 1735 when King George II gave it to Sir Robert Walpole, who was the First Lord of the Treasury and regarded as the first effective Prime Minister of Britain. Since then, it has been home to some of the most influential leaders in British history, including Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and more recently, Boris Johnson. The building is made of yellow brick and includes both living quarters for the Prime Minister and their family as well as numerous offices and meeting rooms for the staff. At the heart of 10 Downing Street is the Cabinet Room, where high-level government meetings and decisions take place. In addition to its significance as the residence of the Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street has also played a crucial role in British history. Important policy decisions, pivotal meetings, and historic speeches have all taken place within its walls. Despite its high-profile status and public prominence, 10 Downing Street is well-protected, with extensive security measures in place due to potential terrorist threats and other risks. Access to the street is restricted to authorized personnel, and members of the public are generally only able to view the iconic black door from behind a gated barrier.

Article: Opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first longspan bridge to carry motor traffic, and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century. Spanning New York's East River, it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer--1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time.

There are various reasons that could have contributed to their different life choices, and we will discuss them below. Firstly, Lindsey might have grown up in a larger family herself, where she experienced the joys and warmth of having numerous siblings to laugh, play, and grow up with. This could have played a major role in her decision to have a lot more babies than Amy. On the other hand, Amy might have felt that a smaller family would be easier to manage and more within her means, both financially and emotionally. Secondly, financial stability can be a huge factor that dictates the family size one can afford. Lindsey might be in a better financial situation, with a steady and high income, allowing her to provide adequately for a larger family. Meanwhile, Amy might be more financially cautious, considering the rising expenses that come with raising children in today's world, and therefore decided on a smaller family. Thirdly, personal beliefs, values, or cultural backgrounds may also come into play. Lindsey might hold traditional beliefs that involve having numerous children, or her cultural background might emphasize the importance of large families. Amy, alternatively, could place greater importance on other aspects of life, like career advancement, personal growth, or leisure, thus settling for a smaller family to maintain a balance in her life. Lastly, health factors can also impact a couple's choice in how many children they want to have. Lindsey may be blessed with good health and minimal complications during pregnancies, making it easier for her to have more children. On the contrary, Amy might face certain health challenges or potential complications that could discourage her from having a large family. In conclusion, there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer for why Lindsey has a lot more babies than Amy. The difference in their family sizes is likely the result of various factors, including their childhood experiences, financial situations, personal beliefs, and health circumstances. While family dynamics and preferences differ, what is most important is that these decisions are made with love, understanding, and consideration for the well-being of all members involved."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: With its walls left to crumble, and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases, it's easy to imagine how Overstone Hall might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep. However, the Northamptonshire stately home's troubles run far deeper than that. Right from its first owner - Lord Overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and, since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago, it has been up for sale for a mere £1million but without any interest. Scroll down for video. Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire was hated by Lord Overstone whose wife commissioned the vast property in 1860 and has never been wanted by any of its owners. The stately home boasts 114 rooms, occupying 20,000sq ft and sits on 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. The 19th century stately home boasts 114 rooms in 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. Lady Overstone commissioned the Elizabethan and Renaissance style building in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. Unfortunately her husband Lord Overstone hated the design, built by architect William Milford Teulon, and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends. 'The new house, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation,' wrote Lord Overstone. 'It is an utter failure, although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste, comfort nor convenience. I am utterly ashamed of it.' Lord Overstone despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883. The lounge inside Overstone Hall in the 1920s when it was owned by Sir Philip Stott who used it as a training base for Conservative party members. Sir Philip Stott who wanted to turn it into a training base for the Conservative Party disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928, before it was sold to the Charlotte Mason Schools Company. Lord Overstone (left) declared that he did not like the mansion his wife had designed and gave it to his daughter Lady Wantage (right) on his death in 1883. Lady Overstone commissioned the Victorian hodgepodge of Elizabethan and Renaissance architectural style in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. The mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house. A fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in April 2001, including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties, so it was sold in 1920. In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties. After she died in 1920, the property was sold to Sir Philip Stott who intended to use it as a training base for Conservative party members. However he condemned the scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928. It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls' boarding school. Lord Overstone hated the house so much that he refused to live there, saying: 'It is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation' The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God, which is asking for the same price. Lord Overstone's daughter, Harriet, inherited the house after his death. Overstone Park was acquired by Lewis Loyd, father of Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone, for £117,500 in 1832. On the death of Lewis Loyd in 1858, the house and 10,000 acres of land became Lord Overstone’s property. The banker and politician had married Harriet, daughter of Conservative politician Ichabod Wright, in 1829. Together they had one son, who died as an infant, and a daughter The Honourable Harriet Sarah Jones Loyd in 1829. In 1860 Lady Overstone decided to engage the architect William Milford Teulon to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste. She was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale. But she commissioned a design with a mixture of Elizabethan and Renaissance features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the Victorian era. Lady Overstone died before the house was completed in November 1864 and left her husband a widower. He hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend: 'The New House, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation. It is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension, it has neither taste, comfort, nor convenience.' He refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter Harriet on his death in 1883,. One of the most revered heiresses of her time, she was a noted philanthropist, and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work. In November 1858 she married Robert James Lindsay, who assumed the name of Loyd-Lindsay by deed poll. Early on, they became the owners of two fine country places - Overstone Park, Northampton, and Lockinge House, Wantage, where the couple chiefly resided. She only used the Overstone estate occasionally for winter hunting parties, as her main home was in Oxfordshire. With her husband, a former distinguished soldier and Victoria Cross hero, she was instrumental in establishing the National Aid Society, which was really the forerunner of the British Red Cross Society. Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting, saying it has been reclaimed by nature.

Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. But I can use this background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... What is an answer for this question: Which person didn't observe any loss in genetic diversity? Answer:","output":"Will is the person who did not observe any loss in genetic diversity. This is because he studied a large, healthy population of the same species, which is less prone to reductions in genetic diversity due to having a larger gene pool. On the other hand, Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals, which is more susceptible to loss of genetic diversity and the associated negative effects."},{"instruction":"Read the text and answer the questions.

A brief sentence is a fundamental component in communication, encompassing a complete thought or idea in a short, simple, and direct manner. These short statements serve various purposes, such as capturing the essence of a topic, relaying quick information, or providing a general overview of a message. When crafting a brief sentence, several factors come into play to ensure effectiveness and clarity. 1. Simplicity: Ensuring that the language used in the sentence is clear and easy to understand is crucial for effective communication. This requires choosing precise words, avoiding complex jargon, and refraining from using multiple clauses within the sentence. 2. Brevity: A brief sentence should be concise, with an emphasis on using as few words as possible to convey the desired information or message. This involves eliminating unnecessary words or phrases that do not contribute to the overall meaning. 3. Focus: The sentence should center on a single idea or concept, maintaining a narrow scope. This ensures that the reader can easily comprehend the intended point without becoming overwhelmed by additional details or tangential information. 4. Punctuation: When forming a brief sentence, it is essential to mind punctuation use. A correctly punctuated sentence contributes to the clarity of the statement and allows readers to parse the meaning with ease. 5. Rhythm: Although not always necessary, incorporating rhythm into a brief sentence can make it more enjoyable to read and easier to remember. This involves intentionally adjusting the structure and word choice to achieve a particular flow within the sentence. Taking into consideration these pivotal aspects, one can craft a brief sentence that successfully conveys a complete thought or idea with both efficiency and clarity. In practice, a succinct statement such as, \\"The sun set, casting a golden glow across the horizon,\\" demonstrates a fusion of these key elements, producing an evocative image in the reader's mind while maintaining simplicity, brevity, and focus."},{"instruction":"I went to Taqueria Canonita with a large group. In our party was a 50-year-old, white southerner who, we later find out, eats nothing but meat and potatoes. And has truly never had Mexican food. It was hilarious watching this extremely polite man's reactions as we tried to explain what a burrito is or why anyone would slow-roast pork on a banana leaf. He eventually settled on three soft tacos with rice but was perplexed with the color of the restaurant's cilantro rice. \\"Now, I hope you don't mind me asking but is green a normal color for rice?\\" I really liked Taqueria Canonita. I tried the Pepita Crab Cakes and the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla as appetizers. Both were very flavorful. I was actually surprised with the crab cakes because I usually compare them against those found in New England. They were solid, especially given that we were sitting in the middle of the desert. The chips were just okay but the salsa was good. And the guacamole was excellent and they give you a ton of it. For my entree, I ordered the Mexico City Chicken Enchiladas. It was good but nothing spectacular. I had a couple margaritas and they were okay. Nothing to write home about either but it did its job. The inside of the restaurant had a really fresh, hip vibe. We sat on the patio, under the Venetian's stars and next to the canal. After the second drink, I almost forgot that I was inside of a mall. For a place that serves green rice, this place was definitely able to please the crowd. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having a mostly positive sentiment. The reviewer enjoyed their experience at Taqueria Canonita, appreciated the flavorful appetizers, liked the guacamole, and found the restaurant's atmosphere fresh and hip.

Erin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines. There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of 90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?","output":"Step 1: Convert quarters and dimes into their monetary value. A quarter is worth 0.25 and a dime is worth 0.10. Step 2: Find out the total amount of money held by one machine. To do this, multiply the number of coins by their value for both quarters and dimes separately and then add the separate amounts together. - Total value of quarters from one machine: 80 quarters × 0.25/quarter = 20 - Total value of dimes from one machine: 100 dimes × 0.10/dime = 10 Step 3: Combine the total value from quarters and dimes to find the value of one machine. - Total value from one machine: 20 (quarters) + 10 (dimes) = 30 Step 4: Find the number of machines in the launderette by dividing the total amount of money she cashed in (90) by the amount of money held by each machine (30). - Number of machines: 90 / 30 = 3 machines Final answer: There are 3 machines in the launderette."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'architect'. A:","output":"Based on the given information, there is no mention of a specific architect or architectural project, so it is not possible to determine the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'architect'."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family. - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms. - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there. - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF. - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s. - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name . - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere. - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language. It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation. What entity does 'strauss' has the relation 'is a list of' with?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"?

When the light turns green, which accelerates more slowly? (A) cement mixer (B) motorcycle. What is the most sensical answer between \\"cement mixer\\" and \\"motorcycle\\"? The answer is:","output":"A) cement mixer The most sensical answer between \\"cement mixer\\" and \\"motorcycle\\" is the cement mixer (A), as it accelerates more slowly than the motorcycle. To understand why this is the more logical answer, let's delve deeper into the physics involved in this situation. The acceleration of an object depends upon two factors: force and mass. In more precise terms, Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object (a) is directly proportional to the net force acting on it (F) and inversely proportional to its mass (m). This can be formally expressed as: a = F/m In the context of our cement mixer and motorcycle scenario, the force acting on each vehicle comes primarily from their engines. While the cement mixer undoubtedly has a more powerful engine than the motorcycle, its substantially greater mass means that this force is distributed over a larger amount of matter. As a result, its acceleration will be slower. On the other hand, the motorcycle is a much lighter vehicle. Its engine, though relatively weaker in comparison to the cement mixer's, doesn't have to work against nearly as much mass. As a result, the force generated by the motorcycle's engine relative to its mass is higher. Therefore, its acceleration will be greater than that of the cement mixer when the light turns green. Another factor to consider is the distribution of power to each vehicle's wheels. The cement mixer will typically have multiple wheels connected to its drivetrain, while a motorcycle will only have two. Consequently, the cement mixer's power will be more widely distributed, making it more difficult to convert raw engine force into acceleration. In contrast, the motorcycle's relatively lightweight drivetrain allows it to convert more force into acceleration, which contributes to its faster acceleration. In summary, the cement mixer accelerates more slowly than the motorcycle due to the former's larger mass and more distributed power, necessitating a stronger force from its engine to achieve the same acceleration as the motorcycle. As a result, when the light turns green, the cement mixer (A) is the sensical answer to the question."},{"instruction":"- Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is exhaling the carbon dioxide and other waste gases. After the carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and collected in the lungs, it is then expelled from the body when we exhale. This process, known as respiration, is crucial for maintaining a proper balance of gases within our body and ensuring adequate oxygen supply to sustain life. In summary, the steps include: 1. Inhaling air through the mouth or nose 2. Air passes through the windpipe (trachea) and goes to the lungs 3. Inside the lungs, air is divided into smaller bronchi and then even smaller bronchioles 4. The bronchioles lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli where gas exchange occurs 5. In the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the blood while carbon dioxide (waste gas) diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli 6.

Which group studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation? Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Hindu philosophy is a vast and complex system of beliefs that has evolved over thousands of years. At its core, it seeks to understand the nature of reality and the purpose of human existence. One of the fundamental concepts in Hindu philosophy is the idea of Atman and Brahman, which form the basis of the Hindu understanding of the relationship between the ultimate reality and the individual self. Atman is the individual self or soul, and it represents the true essence of a person. It is the eternal and immutable aspect of an individual, which remains constant despite the ever-changing circumstances of life. According to Hindu philosophy, the Atman is not limited to just the physical body or the mind but transcends these limitations to form a deeper and more profound identity that is connected to the ultimate reality. Brahman, on the other hand, is the ultimate reality that encompasses everything. It is the infinite, eternal, and unchanging principle that is the foundation of all existence. It is both transcendent, as it exists beyond the limitations of space and time, and immanent, as it pervades and supports the entire universe. The Brahman is often described as Sat (truth), Chit (consciousness), and Ananda (bliss), highlighting its role as the ultimate source of truth, consciousness, and joy. The relationship between Atman and Brahman forms a crucial aspect of Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Vedantic tradition. According to the Vedanta, the true nature of the Atman is identical to that of the Brahman. This idea is encapsulated in the famous Mahavakya (great statements) of the Upanishads: \\"Tat Tvam Asi\\" (Thou Art That), \\"Aham Brahmasmi\\" (I am Brahman), \\"Prajñānam Brahma\\" (Consciousness is Brahman), and \\"Ayam Atma Brahma\\" (This Atman is Brahman). These statements suggest that the individual self (Atman) is not separate from the ultimate reality (Brahman) but is one and the same. The realization of the unity of Atman and Brahman is seen as the ultimate goal of human life in Hindu philosophy. This state, known as Moksha or liberation, is achieved when one recognizes that the true nature of the self is not distinct from the ultimate reality. Moksha is characterized by the dissolution of the illusion of separateness, resulting in a state of eternal bliss, peace, and freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (Samsara). Various paths and practices have been prescribed in Hindu philosophy to help individuals realize the unity of Atman and Brahman. These paths include Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action), and Raja Yoga (the path of meditation and self-control). To gain a complete understanding of the oneness of Atman and Brahman, one must utilize a combination of these paths, as they all contribute to the development of the intellectual, emotional, and moral aspects of an individual. In conclusion, the concepts of Atman and Brahman form the cornerstone of Hindu philosophy, representing the relationship between the individual self and the ultimate reality. The recognition of their unity is the ultimate goal of human existence in the Hindu tradition, and various paths and practices have been prescribed to help individuals on their journey toward this realization. The pursuit of this understanding provides a framework for personal growth and spiritual development, leading to the attainment of Moksha and a state of eternal bliss and harmony."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: Who is he? Here is a hypothesis: I know who that man is. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is essential to analyze the given premise and hypothesis thoroughly before determining whether the truth of the premise implies the truth of the hypothesis. Let's break down the provided statements: Premise: \\"Who is he?\\" This is a question, not a statement, so it cannot be true or false. A premise should be a statement with a truth value (true or false) that can help determine the validity of a hypothesis. Hypothesis: \\"I know who that man is.\\" This statement suggests that someone claims to know the identity of the man specified in the discussion. This hypothesis can be either true or false, depending on whether the person making the claim actually knows the man's identity. Now, let's address the main question: \\"Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\" Since the given \\"premise\\" is not an assertion but a question, it cannot be evaluated as true or false. Therefore, it cannot serve as a valid premise upon which to base a conclusion concerning the hypothesis. To determine the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, both must be statements bearing truth values. To create a proper logical structure, consider reframing the premise as a statement. For example: New Premise: \\"He is John, the person we met yesterday.\\" Hypothesis: \\"I know who that man is.\\" In this case, it is possible to examine whether the truth of the premise leads to the truth of the hypothesis. If the premise is true and the man is indeed John who we met yesterday, it follows that the person making the claim knows the man's identity, making the hypothesis true. However, in the original formulation of the premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true because the premise is a question rather than a statement."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: V _ , an artist of tremendous energy and prodigious output. He killed himself when he was only 37, but he left behind him more than 2,000 paintings and drawings, which established his reputation in a way he would never have considered possible. Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 at Groot Zundert Province of Noord Nrabant in Dutch. He was the son of a clergyman. His first artist impressions were formed as a boy, from his uncle who was an art dealer. The motivation bore early fruit and from the age of 12 the young Vincent was drawing. The interest led to an apprenticeship in an art dealer's firm, Groupil's, in the Hague. When he was only 20, he was transferred to the firm's London office. In London Van Gogh faced his first major crisis, when he was rejected in love. After that, he turned to religion, expressed disapproval with art-dealing and neglected his work. Groupil transferred him from London to Paris but, when his work was still unsatisfactory, dismissed him in 1876. The young Van Gogh made religion a consuming interest and during the next few years travelled in Britain, Belgium and Holland, trying to establish himself as a preacher, but without success. In 1880, at the age of 27, he found himself drawn back to art. He had a job as an assistant evangelist in the mining village of Borinage in Belgium but realized an artist drive which was to motivate him unceasingly until his death 10 years later. Late in 1881, he moved to the Hague and established a relationship with a woman, Christine Hoornik, with whom he lived for a time. He broke with her in 1883, however, and never again established a significant intimate relationship with a woman. In 1886 Van Gogh left Holland forever and travelled via Antwerp to Paris, and to major changes in artistic style. Van Gogh's work became more youthful in Paris. He lived with his brother, Theo, who managed the modern department of an art dealer's. A new, more animated, painting style emerged and the impressionist tendencies of earlier work weakened somewhat.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began to return to a hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.

Here's the chain of thought and solution for this question: 1. Identify the subject: Nicolae Ceaușescu is the subject of the statement, a key person in the history of Romania. He was a prominent politician and the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party. 2. Contextualize the statement: We need to understand the context of the statement, which is about Nicolae Ceaușescu interacting with children in foster homes, presumably during his time in power. 3. Research Nicolae Ceaușescu: In order to verify the statement, we need to gather information on Nicolae Ceaușescu and his actions and behaviors during his time in power. 4. Search for information related to Ceaușescu and foster homes: We can look for any records, reports, or statements that discuss Nicolae Ceaușescu's visits to foster homes and his interactions with children during those visits. 5. Analyze the gathered information: After collecting relevant information, we need to evaluate its credibility and cross-check with multiple sources if possible. Based on preliminary research, Nicolae Ceaușescu's regime is known for its policies that impacted the lives of Romanian citizens, including the construction of large institutions to house abandoned children. However, there are no substantial reports or records that suggest Nicolae Ceaușescu personally visited foster homes frequently and played games with children in those homes. In conclusion, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that the statement \\"Nicolae Ceaușescu played games with children in foster homes\\" is entirely accurate. While Ceaușescu's regime is known for its impact on children's lives, there lacks concrete evidence showing his direct involvement in playing games with foster children."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Ovovivipary refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother’s body until it hatches.

These men came all the way from Iceland, a faraway snowy country. They were very excited to go skydiving on that sunny Saturday, but something went very wrong. You see, when they jumped out of the airplane, they were wearing parachutes to help them float gently from the sky. But, both of their main parachutes didn't open! No one knows why it happened. Maybe something distracted them while they were falling through the sky. Now, the people who are in charge of finding out what happened, called authorities, are trying to solve this mystery. They think that a special camera, which one of the men wore on his helmet, might have some clues about the accident. Even though their main parachutes didn't open, they had extra reserve parachutes. These opened automatically, on their own. But, it was too late. The reserve parachutes didn't have enough time to slow them down, and sadly, both men passed away. This was their third jump of the day, and they were having so much fun before the accident happened. Skydiving is a fun sport where you can feel like you're flying. Over time, it has become safer, but sometimes accidents still happen. Last year, out of 3.1 million jumps in the United States, 19 people died while skydiving.

The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \\"Popish Plot\\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne.

Serbia international Milan Jovanovic headed in a 19th-minute cross from Dutch winger Ryan Babel, but Spanish goalkeeper Jose Reina allowed the home side to level with half an hour to play as he failed to keep out a header by Eder Bonfim. That kept Roy Hodgson's team three points clear ahead of the final Group K match at home to Utrecht on December 15. The Dutch club are five points behind their upcoming opponents following a 3-3 draw at home to Napoli -- who have also drawn four of their five matches. Balotelli double helps Manchester City qualify. Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick to help the Italian club come from 3-1 down and end their hosts' hopes of progressing, while the Serie A outfit can through to the last 32 by winning at home to the Romanians next month. Paris St. Germain qualified with a 4-2 victory over Sevilla that lifted the French side two points clear of the second-placed Spaniards in Group J. Mathieu Bodmer and Guillaume Hoarau scored from two early corners by Nene before the Brazilian midfielder made it 3-0, then Mali striker Fredi Kanoute netted a double for the visitors. Hoarau's second goal just after halftime left Sevilla needing a point from their final game at home to Borussia Dortmund to progress. The Germans kept their hopes alive with a 3-0 win at home to pointless Ukrainian side Karpaty Lviv. In Group L, Turkish side Besiktas went through with a 2-1 win at Bulgaria's CSKA Sofia.

As highlighted, a woman who eats an average amount of rice would get 49 percent of the maximum recommended arsenic \\"dose\\" from that one source. ||||| A new University of Washington study that tested 65 wines from America's top four wine-producing states -- California, Washington, New York and Oregon -- found all but one have arsenic levels that exceed what's allowed in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows drinking water to contain no more than 10 parts per billion of arsenic. The wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. But a companion study concluded that the likely health risks from that naturally-occurring toxic element depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. The highest risks from arsenic exposure stem from certain types of infant formulas, the study estimated. The two studies from UW electrical engineering professor Denise Wilson appear on the cover of the October 2015 issue of the Journal of Environmental Health. \\"Unless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there's little health threat if that's the only source of arsenic in your diet,\\" said Wilson. \\"But consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice -- all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning -- you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly.\\" Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is toxic to humans in some forms, and can cause skin, lung and bladder cancers, and other diseases. As rain, rivers or wind erode rocks that contain arsenic, it leaches into water and soil. From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. The UW study is the first peer-reviewed research in decades to look at the arsenic content of American wines. As a group, they had higher arsenic levels than their European counterparts, likely due to the underlying geology of U.S. wine growing regions. The study looked at red wines, except from two areas in Washington where only white wines were produced, because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. Wilson also tested for lead, which is a common co-contaminant. The study found lead in 58 percent of the samples, but only 5 percent -- all from New York -- exceeded drinking water standards. Washington wines had the highest arsenic concentrations, averaging 28 parts per billion, while Oregon's had the lowest, averaging 13 parts per billion. \\"There were no statistical differences among Washington, New York and California,\\" she said. \\"The only star in the story is Oregon, where arsenic concentrations were particularly low.\\" Where possible, the study also compared wines grown in \\"new\\" vineyards and those that had been converted from other agricultural uses like orchards, where farmers likely used arsenic-based pesticides that were popular in the early 20th century. It found some evidence that higher levels of arsenic in Washington red wines could be a result of pesticide residue. Because the average adult drinks far more water (between 1.7 and 3.2 cups per day) than even core or frequent wine drinkers (roughly a half cup per day on average), it's an imperfect comparison to gauge health risks based on the EPA drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion. That's why Wilson also evaluated how much arsenic individuals can safely consume from all the sources in their diet. In a companion study, she compiled consumption data for foods that have been shown to contain arsenic -- juice, milk, bottled water, wine, cereal bars, infant formula, rice, salmon and tuna. From that, she was able to determine how much of an arsenic \\"dose\\" an average child or adult would get from each food source and how close it would come to risk thresholds set by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry for total arsenic consumption across a person's diet. For the core or frequent adult wine drinker, the arsenic consumed from that single source would only make up 10 to 12 percent of the total maximum recommended daily arsenic intake. But if that person also eats large quantities of contaminated rice, tuna or energy bars, for instance, that could push that individual's arsenic consumption beyond levels that are considered safe. A person who eats an average or large amount of contaminated rice would get between 41 and 101 percent of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that one source alone, the study found. A child who drinks apple juice could get a quarter of the maximum daily arsenic dose from that single source. The food that posed the largest risk of arsenic poisoning was infant formula made with organic brown rice syrup, an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Wilson estimated that some infants eating large amounts of certain formulas may be getting more than 10 times the daily maximum dose of arsenic. Based on recent studies that have found arsenic in numerous foods and beverages, Wilson recommends that U.S. wineries test for arsenic and lead in irrigation and processing water and take steps to remove those contaminants if levels are found to be high. But rather than litigate against vineyards - as some have done - she would encourage consumers to evaluate their diets more holistically and speak with a doctor if they have concerns. Tests are available that can detect high arsenic levels and tend to capture arsenic exposure over longer histories than other toxic chemicals. \\"The whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard,\\" Wilson said. \\"My goal is to get people away from asking the question 'who do we blame?' and instead offer consumers a better understanding of what they're ingesting and how they can minimize health risks that emerge from their diets.\\" # For more information, contact Wilson at denisew@uw.edu or 360-969-5959.

The very nature of standing by a pond and engaging in a leisurely activity like fishing solidifies the fact that they are indeed outdoors. Furthermore, the subsequent action of the son wandering off with the fishing net adds to the idea that they are outside, as children exploring and wandering are typical activities for them when in an outdoor environment. The mention of a fishing net also supports this conclusion, as it is an item commonly used in outdoor settings for fishing. The hypothesis, which states that \\"the father is outside,\\" can be derived from the given premise. It aligns with the information provided within the premise, and it is safe to deduce that the hypothesis is true. The father, who is fishing by the pond accompanied by his son, is indeed outside, as per the premise's description."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

The suggestion, Bell said, is \\"because we're Hispanics we're inept to get an ID.\\" The debate over the wave of voter identification laws cropping up in more than 30 states is playing out against the backdrop of the 2012 general election's high-profile fight for Latino voters.

The idea that these laws disproportionately affect Hispanic voters is based on stereotypes and assumptions rather than empirical evidence. Ultimately, voter identification laws help ensure the integrity of elections by preventing voter fraud while respecting the capabilities of all citizens, including Hispanics, to obtain the necessary documentation. Furthermore, efforts should be made to raise awareness and provide assistance to anyone struggling to secure proper identification, rather than assuming any community's inability to do so.

In 2007 Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv, told Israel's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

Many creatures lived in the desert. Some learned to survive within her harsh burning grip. Some even learned to thrive in her, building stone monuments to themselves and living their lives surrounded in the lavish luxuries of Gods. How puny their monuments were compared to the desert herself. Where they had castles surrounded by dry moats, the desert had mountains surrounded by thousand year sandstorms. Where they had silks and the most beautiful slaves serving their every greatest desire, she had dunes that stretched for a thousand leagues and a sun that burned huge and deep crimson in the violet sky. Where desert kings, the Danken, dined on the finest food and drank the finest wine, the desert drank every drop of water from the air itself and feasted on men. Kadin knew the desert. He knew her voice whispering in the dark of night like a dangerous lover. The sound he heard now was not her voice but a cry from one trapped within the desert's teeth. It was the cry of a woman. Kadin rose from his makeshift bed in the dip of two dunes. He stood quickly, tying the leather straps of his knife belt around his waist. He pulled on his boots and silently mounted White Ash. THe mare felt his soft touch and made no sound. Kadin listened and heard the cry again. He studied the dunes in the darkness of night. THe blood moon painted the desert a deep red.

He guessed four riders from the sound of their horses and confirmed it when he rose above them. Three men, now on foot, chased a woman in black across the dune. Their horses stood back, panting from a hard ride. The woman's own stallion lay dead, a black arrow buried in its flank. Kadin must make a decision about: - Whether to build a castle in the desert. - Whether or not to sell his horse White Ash. - Whether or not to help the woman. - not enough information A:","output":"Given the situation, it is best for Kadin to prioritize the woman's safety. Building a castle or selling White Ash is not immediately relevant to the urgent situation at hand. Therefore, Kadin should decide on whether or not to help the woman.

The new “Driving Under the Influence of Electronics” law puts stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in cars, reports the Seattle Times. Even when stopped at a red light or in standstill traffic, drivers can be ticketed for simply holding their phones. The law allows phone usage strictly in emergency situations or with apps that are voice-activated, controlled through dashboards, or mounted for map navigation that requires “minimal use” of fingers. Per USA Today, offenders will be slapped with a 136 fine for first offenses; the penalty increases to 234 for additional offenses within five years. Police will report offenses to insurance companies and they’ll also appear on driving records. Non-electronic distractions like applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap are also restricted as a secondary offense and run a 99 fine. “If I see you speeding and as you speed by me, I see that you're eating a big old cheeseburger, that's a secondary,” Washington State Patrol trooper Will Finn explained to Fox 12 during a ride along, during which he pulled over a driver (who was “shocked” to find out about the law) for speeding while eating an ice cream cone. Finn added that educating drivers is key in the first stages of the law to get to Washington’s Traffic Safety Commission’s \\"Target Zero\\" goal of no deaths on the road by 2030. Per the Times, distracted driving causes a third of road deaths. A spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association says Washington, the first state to ban texting while driving 10 years ago, \\"has the potential to be a game changer and serve as a model for other states.\\"","output":"Title: Washington State Enforces \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" Law to Combat Distracted Driving As of Sunday, Washington state has implemented stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices while driving with the introduction of the new \\"Driving Under the Influence of Electronics\\" law.

Drivers caught using electronic devices in non-emergency situations or without voice-activated apps, dashboard controls, or mounted map navigation systems could face significant fines. The penalties for breaking the new law are severe. According to USA Today, first-time offenders will be charged a 136 fine, with the penalty increasing to 234 for further offenses within five years.

The dictionary and its style guide would make Mrs. Grundy proud. Sentence 2: Mrs. Grundy would hate the dictionary and its style guide. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand why, we first need to clarify what entailment means in the context of logic and linguistic semantics. Entailment is a relationship between two statements where if the first statement is true, the second statement must also necessarily be true. However, the reverse is not always the case. In the given pair of sentences, the first statement says that the Microsoft product, the new Encarta Dictionary, and its style guide are of a quality or characteristic that would make Mrs. Grundy proud. It establishes a positive connection between Mrs. Grundy and the referenced dictionary. However, the second sentence directly contradicts the sentiment expressed in the first one, stating that Mrs. Grundy would hate the dictionary and its style guide. This is a complete reversal of the positive association made in the first sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is not following logically from the first one, or '\\"entailed\\" by the first sentence. If the first sentence proposes that Mrs. Grundy would be proud of the dictionary, it cannot also be true that she would hate it, especially given no changes or new information has been introduced between the two sentences. Consequently, in context of these two statements, they present opposing views and the second is not a logical consequence or entailment of the first. To have an entailment, the second sentence should be something like \\"Mrs. Grundy would appreciate the dictionary and its style guide,\\" which maintains the positive sentiment of the first sentence and logically follows from it."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Deep breathing is a great exercise to make use of when you’re feeling rage. It allows you to slow down and regain control of your thoughts and emotions as well as the situation itself. Do several cycles of deep breathing until you feel calmer. Try pulling in deep breaths from your diaphragm. Inhale and watch your belly expand. Exhale and watch it deflate. With each inhale, imagine yourself being filled with calm energy. With each exhale, envision the rage being expelled from your body. Rage can cause extreme physical tension in your body, which can actually lead to injury. Progressive muscle relaxation is a useful exercise for easing this tension. Take deep, calming breaths. Start at your toes and work your way up through your body, gradually contracting and relaxing each muscle group. For instance, you might tense your toes up and notice what that feels like for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and notice what that feels like before moving to a new muscle group. This technique also helps you become more aware of the experience of holding tension in your body. In the future, when you feel that tension, you’ll know how to relax your muscles. Aggressive actions like punching, throwing something, or yelling don’t always lead to catharsis. Why? Because you haven’t actually addressed the thing that’s making you feel enraged. Writing in a journal is one of the best ways to do this. Start a rage journal in which you regularly jot down all the people or situations that rub you the wrong way. Describe everything in as much detail as you can. Once you’ve let off some steam, go back and re-read what you wrote. You might decide to go ahead and rip the paper to pieces. You might also decide to brainstorm some ways to actively problem-solve the situations that make you so angry.","output":"Deep breathing is an effective exercise to manage rage, helping you regain control of thoughts and emotions.

In this case, the possessive form \\"kiitollisuuteni\\" is used to demonstrate possession. 3. to all the Members = kaikille jäsenille - \\"to all\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"kaikille,\\" which is the allative plural form of the adjective \\"kaikki\\" (all) to indicate the direction of the action (expressing gratitude) towards all recipients. - \\"the Members\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"jäsenet.\\" In this case, the plural allative form \\"jäsenille\\" is used to agree with \\"kaikille\\" (to all). 4. of this House = tämän talon - \\"of this\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"tämän,\\" which is the genitive form of the demonstrative pronoun \\"tämä\\" (this) to show possession. - \\"House\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"talo.\\" In this case, the genitive form \\"talon\\" is used to agree with \\"tämän\\" (of this). 5. who were with us there = jotka olivat kanssamme siellä - \\"who\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"jotka,\\" which is the plural form of the relative pronoun 'joka' (which, who) used to refer to the members of the House. - \\"were\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"olivat,\\" which is the past tense of the verb 'olla' (to be) in the 3rd person plural. - \\"with us\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"kanssamme.\\" This is formed by combining the preposition 'kanssa' (with) and the first person plural pronoun 'me' (us) in the comitative case (to indicate the company). - \\"there\\" is translated to Finnish as \\"siellä,\\" which is an adverb indicating the location."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the...

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists.

Though intended as a theatrical feature , it was ultimately released directly to television . - Phil Tucker (May 22, 1927 November 30, 1985) was an American film director, writer, producer, and film editor. While Tucker directed his first six feature films in the span of two years (while still in his mid-20s), he is best known for his first film, the science fiction B movie \\"Robot Monster\\", often considered an example of \\"so bad it's good\\" film-making in the Ed Wood vein, and for the Lenny Bruce movie \\"Dance Hall Racket\\". - A B movie is a low-budget commercial movie that is not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a double feature. Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term \\"B movie\\" continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today. In its postGolden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity. - Dance Hall Racket is a 1953 American film directed by Phil Tucker starring Lenny Bruce (who also wrote the script) and his wife Honey Harlow. - Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925 August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and screenwriter. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor George Pataki in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken counterculture-era comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States. - Robot Monster (a.k.a. Monster from Mars) is a 1953 independently made American black-and-white 3D science fiction film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, written by Wyott Ordung, that stars George Nader, Claudia Barrett, and George Barrows.

Ajmol Alom, 16, had been playing football with some friends in a park in Poplar, east London, last August 12 and were on their way home when the gang wearing hoodies and bandanas attacked them near some shops in Spey Street. Without saying a word, they knifed Ajmol’s friend, in the face then turned on Ajmol when he intervened. Tragic: Ajmol Alom, 16 who was stabbed to death near his home in Poplar, east London, last August, just days before his GCSE results. The attackers used kitchen knives and a machete-like blade to carry out the assaults. Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Mashudur Rahman, 22, and Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20, were told by Judge Martyn Zeidman, QC at Snaresbrook Crown Court that they will serve a minimum of 23 years. Ajmol, described as one of the brightest pupils at nearby Langdon Park School, was just days away from receiving his GCSE results and it later emerged that he had achieved top marks including eight A and three B grades. Judge Zeidman said the gang’s actions had ‘imposed upon the Alom family a life sentence of sadness and mourning’ adding that the attack on Ajmol and his friend, who was stabbed in the face with a 10in knife but has since made a good recovery, were ‘totally unprovoked’.

There has to be a change. But cold figures can never sufficiently reflect the tragic sorrow caused by knife crime. ‘In our case there were two totally unprovoked attacks upon 16-year-old boys. ‘The first stabbing was to [Ajmol friend]'s face but that did not quench your joint thirst for violence. ‘Within a minute or so you were each a party to the second attack, this time upon Ajmol Alom. You each played a part in bringing his life to an end.’ Scene of the crime: Spey Street in Poplar, east London, where Ajmol Alom was murdered last summer. Judge Zeidman said that he could not say for sure which defendant stabbed each victim but it was clear it was a ‘joint enterprise’ between them. ‘I am sure that this was a planned premeditated group attack, carried out in revenge upon a random selection of targets who were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing and who had not in any way provoked the attack,’ he said.

Rahman received a three-year sentence in a young offenders’ institution for stabbing someone in the face with a seven-inch knife, while Choudhary did not have any knife crime on his record but has 15 previous convictions, including an unprovoked group attack on a man in a street. Khan, who was taken into care at the age of 15, has four offences of assault or battery on his record, including a robbery in which he threatened a man on a bus with a knife, the court was told. After the men were led down from the dock, Judge Zeidman offered his condolences to Ajmol’s family in the public gallery and said it was clear the teenager was an ‘exceptional person’. ‘Some have emphasised his intellectual qualities.

One evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a naiad-like character (called a \\"Narf\\") from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\", a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf. Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To recover from her wounds and return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer.

Figures show that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food. Scroll down for video. Christmas wastage: Britons will throw away an incredible £64m in excess food on 25 December. The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, while leftover carrots could reach from London to Munich, end-to-end. And unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 17.2m Brussels sprouts. 11.9m carrots. 11.3m roast potatoes. 10.9m parsnips. 9.8m cups of gravy. 7.9m slices of turkey. 7.9m cups of stuffing. 7.5m mince pies. 7.4m slices of Christmas pudding. 7.1m pigs in blankets. The poll by Unilever showed that whoever hosts Christmas lunch spends on average £112 on food alone. Typically, there are six of us around the Christmas dinner table and we're each expected to eat £18.60 worth of food. But it would take the average family nearly four days to eat everything bought just for Christmas Day. The study also found a third of British diners admit to serving themselves an excessive Christmas dinner that they can't finish. More than a third (36 per cent) of adults cite 'getting caught up in the Christmas spirit' as their excuse for buying too much food for the day. Under-35s are the worst culprits: 15 per cent spend up to £200 on food but confess to discarding £27 worth each. One in five of us admit to buying traditional Christmas food we don't even like, the study revealed. The research was carried out as part of Unilever's Project Sunlight #ClearAPlate campaign, to show that food poverty is closer to home than many people think. Half a million meals will be provided to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam. Jon Goldstone, Unilever Foods Director, said: 'We were shocked to hear just how much food goes to waste at Christmas. 'The festive season is naturally a time when we indulge with our family and friends but throwing away 4.2 million perfectly good Christmas dinners is a staggering waste. 'Having seen these figures, this year I know I will be putting a little more thought into my Christmas shopping and through our #ClearAPlate campaign we're encouraging others to do the same.' The #ClearAPlate campaign pledges to provide an additional half a million meals to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam and calls on people to do their bit to address food waste in order to help fight hunger.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Input: Passage: Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number. In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree. In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956, started with 1 as its first prime. Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.

Amphitryon worships Zeus, and mocks his prisoner for worshiping Hera by scarring his arm with a lightning bolt symbol. Antaeus breaks free and jumps overboard. Alcmene, Amphitryon's wife, is High Priestess of the Harvest Festival, a yearly ritual devoted to Hera, which involves the human sacrifice of a male. After it is discovered that the intended victim, Tiresias, is a hermaphrodite, the priestesses decide to release him, but gouge out his eyes. On her way home, Alcmene is assaulted and raped by a large man, his face not visible in the darkness. The crime is witnessed by a lyre player, Linus, who declares the culprit to be Zeus, due to the lightning symbol on his arm. Amphitryon arrives home, comforts his wife, and makes love to her. Alcmene becomes pregnant. Alcmene gives birth to fraternal twin sons. She believes this will make her heir to the House of Perseus in Thebes, but is informed that her uncle already had a son, Eurystheus, who will be the heir. She visits the Harpies, to determine which child belongs to Amphitryon and which belongs to Zeus. One harpie attempts to nurse one baby, who bites her. The Harpies declare him Son of Zeus, name him \\"Hercules --glory to Hera\\", and order Alcmene to kill him, departing afterward. Alcmene names the other son, Iphicles, and begs Amphitryon to kill Hercules. Her husband cannot bring himself to do it, so Alcmene sends two snakes into Hercules' crib. The baby picks them up and squeezes them to death. As a teenager, Hercules is very headstrong, foolish, and prideful. He is constantly ridiculed and disdained by his mother, brother, and King Eurystheus. He develops an unrequited crush on Alcmene's protÃ©gÃ©, Megara, who refuses to associate with him because she worships Hera. While being tutored by Linus, Hercules loses his temper and strikes Linus in the head, knocking him out. Everyone mistakenly believes he is dead, so they exile Hercules to the mountains.

In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 20 m/s (4,000 ft/min), A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering).

The EcoDisc motor is compact, energy-efficient, and directly attached to the drive sheave, making it suitable for low- to mid-rise applications. The KONE MonoSpace was first introduced in the 1990s as a revolutionary solution for space-saving and cost-effective design. Its innovative approach eliminates the need for a machine room, allowing architects and building owners to maximize their valuable building space for other purposes. This system is widely used in residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings with modest elevator speed and travel distance requirements. Despite not being designed for high-speed, high-rise, and large-capacity applications, the KONE MonoSpace system offers considerable benefits in terms of energy efficiency, space utilization, and overall performance. The slim and lightweight EcoDisc motor, with its disc brake system, ensures safety, smooth operation, and reduced maintenance needs compared to traditional elevator systems.

A hair pick is a hair grooming tool typically used to create volume or separate curls. The aim of this question is to assess the non-conventional usage of this item. However, the appropriateness of the alternatives depends on various aspects. Let's examine each of the propositions: 1. Hair pick as a rake: To evaluate this option, we should note the structural similarity between a rake and a hair pick. Both have a long handle and tines protruding from one side usable to displace material. However, the size difference is apparent. A normal hair pick would be impractical for raking a yard for example due to its small size. Yet in a smaller context, like for a miniature garden or a sandbox, it could function just fine. Its tight tines would be suitable to rake small pebbles and objects. 2. Hair pick as a fork: A hair pick does resemble a fork to some extent in that they both have prongs. However, hair picks aren't typically designed for carrying weight, and so may not be greatly efficient in stabbing and lifting food which is essential for a fork. Additionally, there are hygienic considerations in this option. Hair picks, used in the hair, might gather oil or dirt and it's not safe or healthy to put such item directly into food or into a mouth. In conclusion, both options have their own validity depending on its intended use in specific contexts. If we are specifically talking about miniature gardening or toy play where small scaled raking would be required, then using the hair pick as a rake would be a viable and creative option. However, aside from a dire situation, using a hair pick as a fork would be generally unsuitable due to potential sanitary issues and the physical design of the pick not being optimized for handling food. Thus between these two choices, using a hair pick as a rake would be a more broadly applicable and safer option."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question In the 14th installment of the Brady-Manning Rivalry, the Patriots and Broncos battled in one of the most exciting editions of NBC Sunday Night Football in recent memory. The expected shootout between two potent offenses did not occur at the start of the game, as three New England turnovers on their first three drives of the game gave the Broncos a 17-0 lead in the 1st quarter. It was looking to be one of the most embarrassing performances in Patriot history as an additional touchdown gave Manning and the Broncos a 24-0 at the half. However, Brady and the Patriots were not going to let the Broncos run away with a blowout victory at Gillette. They regrouped in the locker room and came out to score 31 unanswered points, scoring on five straight drives out of the half, helped by three Denver turnovers of their own. The two halves were complete polar opposites, each displaying offensive domination on one side and defensive struggles on the other, flipping 180&#730; at the half. However, the Broncos managed to tie the game at 31 late in the 4th, eventually sending the game to overtime. The Patriots won the coin toss, but surprisingly elected to defend first, hoping to stop the Broncos from scoring and to take advantage of the wind for a potential game-winning field goal. This was exactly what happened, as the two teams traded punts twice, but on New England's second punt, Broncos cornerback Tony Carter ran into the punt, and Patriots' Nate Ebner recovered the ball on the Broncos' 20 yard line, setting up Gostkowski's game winning 31 yard field goal. The 24 point deficit was the largest comeback in Brady's and the Patriots' history, and gave Brady his 10th win in 14 meetings over Manning-led teams. Brady threw for 344 yard and 3 TD's in the contest, and WR Julian Edelman had a career day with 110 receiving yards for two scores. The win from down 24 points was the largest comeback win in Patriots history, surpassing 1984's comeback from down 23-0 against the Seahawks. The Patriots would break this comeback record three years later in Super Bowl LI.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range... - Lawrence Weiskrantz (born 28 March 1926) is a British psychologist, who discovered the phenomenon of blindsight, which is the voluntary visually evoked response to a stimulus presented within a scotoma. - The European Brain and Behaviour Society (EBBS) is a scientific society founded in 1968 whose stated purpose is the exchange of information between European scientists interested in the relationships between brain mechanisms and behaviour. It is the oldest neuroscience society in the world. Notable past presidents include Lawrence Weiskrantz, Giacomo Rizzolatti, Marc Jeannerod, and Barry Everitt.

Question: suppose thee is no baby bird happens, how will it affect baby bird is cared for until it is an adult bird. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In the hypothetical scenario where there is no baby bird hatching from the egg, the entire process of the bird's growth and development would be significantly affected as there would be no bird to nurture, feed, or provide care for. Essentially, the absence of the baby bird would disrupt the entire course of events required for it to become an adult bird. Without the baby bird hatching from the egg, the nurturing provided by its parents would be rendered nonexistent. The parents would have no offspring to care for, and the time and energy invested in rearing their young would be drastically reduced. Consequently, the roles of the bird parents would be less defined without the presence of a baby bird to feed, protect, and teach essential survival skills to. This lack of nurturing would undoubtedly have a significant effect on the absence of the baby bird, as it moves from being nonexistent to non-applicable in this scenario. Furthermore, the supposed perturbation of a nonexistent baby bird would have a huge impact on its growth. With no bird to feed, there would be no need for the parents to gather food, and the entire process of the baby bird's growth would be eliminated. This absence of growth would also prevent the bird from learning how to fly, which is a crucial milestone in its journey toward independence. As the nonexistent bird would never mature, it would not experience the phenomenon of leaving the nest nor would it make its own nest. The consequent effects of establishing territories, finding a mate, and eventually procreating would also be nonexistent, as there would not be a resulting offspring to continue the cycle of life. This would lead to a diminishing population of that particular bird species and potentially affect the balance of the ecosystem in which they reside. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of a nonexistent baby bird hatching from an egg would have a significant and widespread effect on the entire process of the bird's growth and development, from nurturing by its parents to the eventual stage of adulthood. Without a baby bird to undergo these essential experiences, the second effect (being nurtured by its parents) would be much less affected and, ultimately, completely nonexistent. The repercussions of such a change would be far-reaching, impacting not only the individual bird and its family unit but also the broader ecosystem and the long-term survival of the species."},{"instruction":"two people who lost children in the oklahoma city bombing and one who lost a sibling will be among those who will watch in person as timothy mcveigh is executed .

It may be the so-called \\"generation gap\\".A generation gap appears when we begin to feel our parents are ignoring us, don't understand us, and we feel we can no longer share our feelings with them. The key reason is our desire for independence.In senior high school, we start to want to take responsibility for our own lives and make our own decisions.But parents resist this.They still want to control us and try to force us to do things they think we should do.Debate and discussion often come to nothing.Gradually, we talk with them less, and keep our feelings locked up inside.

The practice of spreading fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the dustbin--with young men the worst group--was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million, two million more than the human population.

Now imagine you have -6 apples and then you get 1 more apple. How many apples do you have? That's right! You'll have -5 apples! So left side becomes: -5*a = 4*a Now, to find the value of \\"a\\", we have to move all the \\"a\\" terms to one side of the equation. Let's move -5*a to the right side by adding 5*a to both sides.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"The data provided offers a glimpse into the American Civil War, which was a monumental conflict that took place between 1861 and 1865 in the United States. This war was primarily fought between the Northern states, known as the Union, and the Southern states, referred to as the Confederacy, mainly over the issues of states' rights, slavery, and westward expansion. Jefferson Davis, mentioned in the data, served as the President of the Confederate States of America throughout the duration of the war. He was a key political figure, responsible for the governance and strategic decisions of the Confederacy. Before becoming the President of the Confederate States, he had a long history in American politics and military, having served as the United States Secretary of War as well as a senator from Mississippi. Alfred Moore Scales, another notable figure in the data, was a distinguished Confederate commander who served in numerous battles during the American Civil War. Scales, hailing from North Carolina, showcased exceptional leadership and valor in various capacities. He initially entered the conflict as a captain and rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming a brigadier general in the Confederate army. The data also highlights the Battle of the Siege of Petersburg, which was a crucial military engagement that took place from June 1864 to March 1865. Often referred to as the \\"Trench Warfare\\" of the civil war, the Siege was a strategic campaign waged by Union forces, under the leadership of General Ulysses S. Grant, against the Confederate forces commanded by General Robert E. Lee. The battle aimed to destitute and ultimately capture the city of Petersburg, Virginia, which served as a key supply center for the Confederate capital, Richmond. Throughout this drawn-out battle, both Union and Confederate forces fought tenaciously in a series of battles aimed at weakening the enemy's hold on vital supply routes. The Siege of Petersburg was instrumental in determining the conflict's outcome, serving as a turning point in the American Civil War in favor of the Union. As the data also indicates, the Siege of Petersburg was undeniably a significant part of the larger military conflict of the American Civil War. Its relentless and grueling nature severely impacted both the Confederate and Union soldiers. Ultimately, the Union forces succeeded in breaking the Confederate defense in April 1865, leading to the eventual fall of Richmond and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, which symbolized the end of the American Civil War."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Be yourself. Be confident and laidback. Be mature. Learn healthy relationship skills.","output":"Title: Embracing Confidence and Maturity: The Path to Healthy Relationships Introduction Personal growth, self-awareness, and healthy relationship skills are essential components of a fulfilling life. Strong and long-lasting connections depend on our ability to be our true selves, exude confidence, and possess a level of maturity that promotes personal and emotional development. This article will discuss these qualities, which are crucial for forming deep, meaningful relationships, and offer concrete strategies to foster them. Be Yourself Our individuality is what makes each of us unique and, ultimately, irreplaceable. In any relationship, it's important to remain authentic, express our thoughts and feelings, and resist the urge to wear a metaphorical mask. When we embrace our true selves, it becomes easier for others to connect with and appreciate us for who we truly are. To nurture our authenticity: 1. Reflect on personal values and beliefs to better understand ourselves. 2. Cultivate genuine interests and hobbies to develop our character. 3. Practice open and honest communication with others. 4. Build self-awareness to recognize areas where we can improve. Be Confident and Laidback Being confident and laidback allows us to be comfortable in our own skin, reducing uncertainty and anxiety in relationships. Confidence frees us from the constant need for reassurance, while being laidback aids in maintaining balance in our connections. Enhancing our self-assurance and easygoingness involves: 1. Positively affirming our skills, abilities, and unique qualities every day. 2. Accepting compliments graciously and, when faced with criticism, reflecting on how it can help us grow. 3. Setting healthy boundaries and asserting our needs. 4. Prioritizing self-care and maintaining a strong sense of self, even within our closest relationships. Be Mature Maturity is required for healthy relationships and is exhibited through understanding, empathy, and accountability. A mature individual can embrace challenges and face difficult conversations with grace, even when emotions run high. Ways to embrace maturity include: 1. Practicing active listening to better understand the perspectives of others. 2. Cultivating empathy by placing ourselves in another's shoes. 3. Managing emotions effectively; not allowing every emotional reaction to dictate our actions. 4. Owning our mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and demonstrating a commitment to improvement. Learn Healthy Relationship Skills By developing healthy relationship skills, we prepare ourselves to navigate the complexities and hurdles that will inevitably arise. Some key skills to practice include: 1. Communicating openly, honestly, and respectfully. 2. Establishing trust by keeping promises and being dependable. 3. Balancing our own needs with the needs of our partners. 4. Showing appreciation and gratitude toward them regularly. Conclusion Becoming confident, mature, and true to ourselves is an essential yet rewarding journey. By refining these qualities, we not only set the foundation for our well-being but also lay the groundwork for healthy, thriving relationships. Ultimately, this journey will enable us to form deeper and more fulfilling connections with others, promoting happiness and contentment in all aspects of our lives."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Wings are part of the exoskeleton and attached to the thorax.

Bush groped her during a photo op. Megan Elizabeth Lewis, 38, tells NJ Advance Media that Bush forcibly touched her after he asked her to take a photo with him at a performance of \\"Legally Blonde: The Musical\\" in Houston in 2009. Her claim follows directly on the heels of a Time magazine story in which Roslyn Corrigan claimed Bush groped her in 2003, when she was 16, during a visit the former president made to a Texas CIA office where her father worked as an intelligence officer. As with the alleged Corrigan episode, Lewis said Bush was not in a wheelchair at the time her incident happened. Lewis, who lives in Brooklyn, said she hadn't asked for a photo with the former president, who was then 84, when he came to the show at Houston's Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in February of 2009. But she said he asked her to take one with him, so she approached him. The actress prepared herself for the photo by making a funny face, as she often does when posing. Bush, she said, made a comment about Barbara Bush -- who was also in attendance -- being \\"his silver fox,\\" before allegedly groping Lewis as she mugged for the camera. \\"He grabbed my butt and I was like 'wow,'\\" she said. \\"I remember being really grossed out.\\" \\"I was just disappointed,\\" Lewis added pointing to Bush's alleged comment about Barbara Bush just moments before. \\"You just implied to me that you love your wife very much.\\" Lewis said she also decided to speak out because she was upset to read that a spokesman for Bush seemed to partially attribute his behavior to the fact that he uses a wheelchair. (The former president has vascular parkinsonism, a syndrome that mimics Parkinson's disease and causes problems with walking and balance.) In a statement issued on Oct. 25 in answer to an allegation that the former president had groped a woman in 2014, Jim McGrath, the spokesman, did not deny the claim, but said that because Bush uses a wheelchair, his \\"arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures.\\" Yet Lewis said when Bush, who's now 93, grabbed her, he was not using a wheelchair. \\"He was standing tall, well-dressed, and had the wherewithal to make small talk with a room full of actors,\\" she said. The cast had been told the Bushes would be in attendance that night, but Lewis hadn't planned to ask for a photo. \\"The way that he engaged me (when) I have no intention of being part of it, it seems like that was the way he got his jollies,\\" she said. Bush's spokesperson McGrath did not respond on Tuesday to a request from NJ Advance Media for comment on Lewis' claim. Lewis said she told friends about the encounter at the time. Josh Campbell, a fellow cast member who worked for six months on the show, confirmed the details of the incident, including that it happened in February at the Houston venue. He said Lewis told the cast \\"right afterwards\\" that Bush had groped her during the photo session at intermission. He also remembered the \\"silver fox\\" comment Bush made about the former first lady. \\"At the time, we all just kind of laughed about it,\\" he said, adding that he had heard \\"through the grapevine\\" that Bush had a habit of exhibiting this kind of behavior. Lewis, who has also appeared in the Broadway productions \\"Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark,\\" \\"If/Then\\" and \\"Grey Gardens,\\" said she was moved to go public after reading best-selling Montclair novelist Christina Baker Kline's essay for Slate in which she alleged similar behavior from Bush in 2014. She said she wanted to come forward with her story to support women who have shared their Bush experiences in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and other claims about alleged sexual assault and harassment in entertainment, media, sports and politics. Baker Kline had told NJ Advance Media that several women had contacted her after her essay was published, including one who said she witnessed similar behavior as a former employee of the Bushes. \\"This has been happening for decades,\\" Baker Kline said. Before Baker Kline came forward with her story on Oct. 26, and the Time story about Corrigan's claim was published on Nov. 13, four other women had made similar allegations against Bush. The first woman to speak out, actress Heather Lind, posted on Instagram Oct. 24 that Bush had grabbed her rear during a 2014 photo-op at a screening of her AMC show, \\"Turn: Washington's Spies.\\" \\"He didn't shake my hand,\\" she said. \\"He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke.\\" The second woman to make a claim, actress Jordana Grolnick, said that in summer of 2016, during a group photo op at a theater in Maine, where the Bushes summer, the former president made a joke as he allegedly grabbed her rear end. He said his favorite magician was \\"David Cop-a-feel,\\" in a nearly identical manner to the experience described in Baker Kline's essay (Bush allegedly asked if the author wanted to know his favorite book, but the \\"Cop-a-feel\\" answer was the same). Like Baker Kline and Corrigan, both Lind and Grolnick shared the photos they took with Bush. Each photo appears to show his hand reaching behind them in the area they describe. Two other women say Bush groped them before he used a wheelchair. Liz Allen, a former editor at the Erie Times-News in Erie, Pennsylvania, who recently won a city council seat there, said Bush touched her rear end in 2004, at a local business event. And Amanda Staples, a former Republican candidate for state Senate in Maine, said Bush groped her in 2006, when she was 29. She shared her own photo with the former president on Instagram. She says Bush delivered a different quip when he squeezed her rear end: \\"I'm not that president.\\" \\"I can only imagine how many women have had their butt grabbed in a photo op,\\" Staples said.

(AP) — A Broadway actress says she was groped by former President George H.W. Bush in 2009, before he started using the wheelchair that a spokesman has cited in previous apologies. Megan Elizabeth Lewis tells NJ.com that Bush was standing when he grabbed her buttocks at the performance of a musical in Houston. She says she was upset by a spokesman's statement that Bush's arm sometimes \\"falls on the lower waist of people\\" when he is in his wheelchair. The spokesman, Jim McGrath, did not respond to a request for additional comment Tuesday. Six other women have said Bush grabbed their buttocks as they stood next to him for photos. The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual assault without consent, but is using the names of women who have spoken publicly. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Megan Elizabeth Lewis, a Broadway actress, has become the seventh woman to say that former President George H.W.

The NIV translation project began in the early 1960s, and it underwent multiple stages, revisions, and updates over the years. The process started in 1965 with the founding of the New York Bible Society International (now known as Biblica), which initiated the idea of creating a contemporary English translation of the Scripture. In order to achieve this goal, a group of Bible scholars and translators called the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT) was formed. The CBT consisted of more than 100 scholars from various denominations and backgrounds, including experts in biblical languages, theology, and communication. Early translation work began in the late 1960s, with the New Testament being completed first. The full Bible, including both the Old and New Testaments, was published in 1978. The translation process utilized the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts to produce an accurate and readable translation. The NIV Bible has gone through several updates over the years to incorporate the latest findings of biblical scholarship and to keep its language current. In 1984, the first major update was released, offering minor revisions to the initial translation. Following this, the NIV underwent a significant revision in 2005, resulting in the publication of the Today's New International Version (TNIV). The TNIV sought to provide a more accurate and gender-inclusive language, but it faced controversy and criticism due to some of its choices in translation. In response to these concerns, the CBT worked on another update that balanced the primary goals of the NIV - accuracy, clarity, and literary quality - while also addressing the feedback received from readers and scholars. This update, known as the NIV 2011, has become the standard edition in use today. In summary, the New International Version Bible's translation process started in the early 1960s, with the full Bible being published in 1978. Since then, it has undergone multiple revisions and updates, with the current edition (NIV 2011) standing as the most widely accepted version."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Douglas Adams wrote popular novels that combined science fiction, humor, and social commentary\\" is a verifiable fact. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Identify the main claim: Douglas Adams wrote popular novels. - Verification: Douglas Adams (1952-2001) was a British author who wrote several popular novels. 2. Identify the genre of the novels: Science fiction - Verification: Douglas Adams is best known for his science fiction series, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This series, which began as a radio drama, was later adapted into novels, comic books, video games, and television series. The story is set in a fictional universe, featuring various extraterrestrial races and advanced technologies, making it fitting to the science fiction genre. 3. Identify the elements of humor: - Verification: Douglas Adams' writing is widely recognized for its comedic and satirical style. His use of wordplay, irony, and absurd situations is known for eliciting laughter and making light of serious subjects. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, in particular, is known for its humorous take on topics such as the meaning of life and the nature of the universe. 4. Identify the presence of social commentary: - Verification: Throughout his works, Douglas Adams infused social commentary and critiques on various subjects, including politics, bureaucracy, religion, and the human condition. For example, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the two-headed three-armed ex-President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, satirizes political corruption and incompetence while the Vogons, an alien race, represent the bureaucratic mindset and soul-crushing conformity.

So, let's proceed: Google Maps gets its satellite images from a variety of sources including government satellites and commercial satellites, and these come from both domestic and international sources. Google buys and licenses this data from these providers. Now, let's break it down: 1. Government imagery: Google sources some of its imagery data from government satellites. For example, in the United States, it gets data from US Geological Survey, NASA, and NOAA. 2. Commercial sources: Google additionally sources its imagery from commercial satellite providers like Maxar Technologies (previously DigitalGlobe), Planet Labs, and more. These companies have their own private imaging satellites that capture and sell high-resolution images of the earth. 3. International providers: Google also obtains imagery from international providers such as CNES/Airbus. Google stitches this data together, and process it to make it useful for users of Google Earth and Google Maps. So it's not a direct \\"live feed\\" from the satellites; instead, it's a patchwork of images taken at different times, compiled and color-corrected so that the whole thing looks relatively seamless.

The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Please answer step by step:","output":"Yes, Rosalind Franklin's work significantly contributed to the field of molecular biology, which in turn paved the way for whole genome sequencing. Here's a step-by-step explanation of her contributions and how they led to whole genome sequencing: Step 1: Rosalind Franklin's key contribution Rosalind Franklin's most notable contribution was discovering the structure of DNA, specifically the famous \\"Photo 51\\" - an X-ray diffraction image of the DNA double helix. This work was crucial to understanding the structure and function of DNA. Step 2: Understanding DNA structure The discovery of the DNA double helix structure by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, which was heavily influenced by Franklin's work, provided researchers with insights into the fundamental building blocks of life. This understanding of DNA's structure allowed scientists to begin studying how genes encoded genetic information. Step 3: Developing DNA sequencing techniques With the knowledge of the DNA double helix structure, several scientists started developing techniques for sequencing DNA in the 1970s. The most well-known methods include the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing and the Sanger sequencing, with the latter (developed by Frederick Sanger) becoming the most widely used approach. Step 4: The Human Genome Project Building on these early sequencing techniques, scientists began a massive effort in 1990 called the Human Genome Project - an international collaboration with the goal of sequencing the entire human genome. This project was completed in 2003, providing us with the first complete reference human genome. Step 5: Whole genome sequencing Following the completion of the Human Genome Project, researchers continued refining sequencing technologies, enabling the development of whole genome sequencing. This method efficiently sequences entire genomes, and with modern advancements such as the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, it has become faster and more cost-effective. In conclusion, Rosalind Franklin's essential work on DNA structure laid the foundation for subsequent discoveries and advancements in molecular biology and DNA sequencing, ultimately leading to the development of whole genome sequencing."},{"instruction":"Ruzilya Khusnutdinova, 24, claiming 16m damages from former boyfriend and company hosting profile.

Ruzilya was very angry and sad because her pictures and some words about her were not nice and very personal. They said things like she had \\"very touchy breasts\\" and showed her wearing not-so-modest clothes. These private pictures showed her on a bed in a thong and bra, which made her feel very upset and embarrassed. Now, Ruzilya wants the people who made her feel bad to fix what they did wrong. She is asking for 16 million because of the damages they caused her.

Choose your answer from: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","output":"Yes, as women rise at work and assume managerial positions, they will have more opportunities to influence decision-making processes and advocate for equal rights. This is important not just for the women in these roles but also for the broader organization and society. When women climb the corporate ladder and enter the ranks of management, they gain a certain level of authority and influence within the company. This newfound power offers them the chance to push for reforms and policies that promote gender equality and support the needs of all employees, regardless of their gender. This may include advocating for fair pay practices, flexible work arrangements, or other initiatives that lead to a more inclusive and equitable workplace. Having women in leadership roles can also change organizational culture by challenging gender stereotypes and biases that may have been ingrained in the company's policies and practices. This has the potential to create a work environment where employees of different genders, backgrounds, and experiences can thrive, allowing for a more diverse and innovative workforce. Moreover, when organizations strive for gender equality and support women in managerial roles, they demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity and equality - values that are becoming increasingly important to customers, partners, and shareholders. This commitment to equal rights can have a positive impact on the organization's bottom line: studies have shown that companies with diverse leadership teams perform better financially and are more innovative than their homogenous counterparts. In addition to the benefits that women can bring to the workplace, empowering women to make managerial decisions can influence broader societal change. When women break through the glass ceiling, they can serve as role models for younger generations, inspiring them to pursue careers and opportunities that might have been previously considered out of reach. This can help to change societal expectations and challenge the notion that gender should limit one's potential or goals. Overall, as women rise at work and become involved in managerial decision-making, they can push for equal rights where it is needed to make things better. By encouraging gender equality, fostering an inclusive organizational culture, and challenging traditional stereotypes, women in leadership positions can contribute to the creation of a fairer, more equitable, and more successful workplace."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

A:","output":"A: The seminal figure from the Romantic Age who inspired the name for Robert Bolt's play is Sir Thomas More. The play, titled \\"A Man for All Seasons,\\" premiered in London in 1960. In using the phrase \\"a man for all seasons,\\" Bolt was referring to the versatility, integrity, and moral uprightness that More demonstrated throughout his life. Sir Thomas More (1478-1535) was an English lawyer, statesman, scholar, and humanist, who remains best known for his devotion to Catholicism and steadfast opposition to King Henry VIII's desire to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. This opposition led to More's execution and, in time, his designation as a saint and martyr in the Catholic Church. Robert Bolt's play is a dramatic portrayal of More's life, courage, and unwavering conscience. It is a powerful exploration of the themes of integrity, power, and the relationship between individual morality and the state. Set during one of the most turbulent periods in English history, \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" delves into More's deep convictions and the fierce opposition he faced from the King and other high-ranking officials. The play underscores the relevance of Sir Thomas More's struggle for conscience and personal liberty, even in today's world. By naming his play after More, Robert Bolt emphasizes the idea that Sir Thomas More is a timeless figure, who serves as an inspiring example of moral principles and virtues for individuals in any age or era.

Despite the ongoing conflict, President Obama maintained that he had made the right decision in pulling out U.S. forces in 2011, but noted that future involvement in Iraq would be continually assessed and adjusted based on the evolving situation. As ISIS grew stronger and more violent, the U.S. and other coalition partners eventually decided to intervene more actively in the region, providing air support to the Iraqi government, training local forces, and deploying Special Operations teams to assist in targeted operations. This multinational response helped the Iraqi military regain control, but the fight against ISIS continued to rage on for years. Throughout the conflict, Sen. John McCain remained a vocal advocate for a more sustained and comprehensive strategy in Iraq and the broader Middle East. In 2017, McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer, causing him to step back from the public eye. However, he continued to work behind the scenes, using his influence to push for a more assertive stance against ISIS and maintain focus on the threats they posed. On August 25, 2018, John McCain passed away, but he left behind a legacy of fighting for what he believed in. McCain's early warnings about the consequences of the withdrawal from Iraq were not forgotten. Though he never received a formal apology from those who once criticized him, many acknowledged that he was right to express concern about the potential dangers of leaving Iraq too quickly. In the years that followed, the situation in Iraq gradually improved as the government, supported by the international community, continued to push back against ISIS. Iraq declared victory over the terrorist group in late 2017, but sporadic violence and skirmishes persisted. As the dust settled, the story of Sen. John McCain's foresight and strong principles endured as an important lesson for future policymakers – sometimes good intentions can have unforeseen and severe consequences, and it is crucial to keep a watchful eye on the global security landscape and maintain a clear, pragmatic, and responsible strategy."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a story, answer the question about the story. The question is the last sentence in the input. The story has one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. Problem:Ella entered the garden. Phone rang. Jack entered the garden. Phone rang. The spinach is in the blue_crate. Jack exited the garden. Ella moved the spinach to the green_treasure_chest. Where will Jack look for the spinach? Solution:","output":"Step 1: Identify the different scenarios in the story: Scenario 1: Individual's belief matches reality. Scenario 2: Individual's belief does not match reality. Scenario 3: An individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. Step 2: Identify the relevant pieces of information in the story. Ella entered the garden. Jack entered the garden. The spinach is in the blue_crate. Jack exited the garden. Ella moved the spinach to the green_treasure_chest. Step 3: Analyze the story with respect to the scenarios. When Jack entered the garden, the spinach was in the blue_crate, and he saw it there. Therefore, his belief matches reality (Scenario 1). However, after he exited the garden, Ella moved the spinach to the green_treasure_chest, which means that Jack's current belief (that the spinach is in the blue_crate) no longer matches reality (Scenario 2). Step 4: Answer the question. Since Jack's last known information about the spinach's location is that it was in the blue_crate, he will look for the spinach in the blue_crate."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among \\"crate diggers\\" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One.

However, it can be confusing since there is another musician named Gene Simmons who is a member of the band KISS. The name \\"Haunted House\\" might refer to a different song by another artist. Given the timeframe 1990, we will assume you are referring to the year of the musician's early releases in the realm of house music. Based on the information in the given article, it's not explicitly mentioning the man who recorded \\"Haunted House\\" or his style during his first releases in 1990. However, by examining the article's details, we can identify some possibilities: 1. Terrence Parker: A Detroit DJ who blended hip-hop music DJing styles like rhythmic scratching into his house mixes. He focused on precision and advanced turntablism. 2. Todd Terry: A pioneer of house music, building on the legacy of underground disco, Terry's sound integrated newer hip-hop influences such as quicker sampling and more rugged basslines. 3. Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell (Burrell): They created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house with 30+ releases on the Nu Groove Record label. Since the man you are referring to is not mentioned in the provided article, we can't determine the exact style he used during his first releases in 1990. However, based on the artists and styles mentioned in the article, these house music styles were popular at the time: 1. Terrence Parker's blending of precise turntablism with hip-hop DJing styles incorporating rhythmic scratching. 2. Todd Terry's hip-hop-influenced sound with quicker sampling and rugged basslines. 3. Burrell's New York Underground sound that enjoyed cult status and high demand in the 2010s. It's worth noting that the artists mentioned in the article were mainly working in the late 1980s, and their styles might not align directly with the \\"Haunted House\\" artist's style in 1990. Further research is needed to identify the man who recorded \\"Haunted House\\" and pinpoint his specific style during his early releases in 1990."},{"instruction":"Tweet: Still too hot to go to sleep.

First, it is important to remember that individual experiences are not universal. Just because one person has not encountered a particular challenge, that does not mean it does not exist for others. In this specific case, the individual's experience of never being denied an opportunity due to their gender is a valuable perspective, but it cannot be exclusively used to draw conclusions about the experiences and opportunities of others on a larger scale. Second, we should consider the role of privilege and the various intersecting factors that might contribute to the individual not experiencing gender-based discrimination, such as race, socio-economic status, location, age, and educational background. These factors can influence the presence or absence of discrimination in an individual's life and consequently shape their experiences and opportunities differently. Third, the broader societal and institutional structures must be taken into account when discussing gender-based discrimination and opportunities. For example, the gender pay gap persists across multiple industries, whereby women consistently earn less than men for the same work. Additionally, women continue to be underrepresented in leadership positions and certain fields, such as technology and engineering. These structural inequalities can negatively impact opportunities for certain individuals based on their gender. When we analyze the available evidence and the complexities of contemporary society, it becomes clear that the conclusion that \\"opportunities are never denied due to gender for anyone\\" is not an accurate representation of the reality faced by many individuals across the globe. Although the person in question has not experienced gender-based discrimination directly, this unfortunately does not negate the fact that it exists for a significant number of others. To conclude, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of drawing upon solely personal experiences for understanding broader social issues. While one individual's experience can be an important perspective, it should not be generalized to represent the realities and challenges faced by others. In order to accurately assess the role of gender in determining opportunities, we must continue to examine systemic inequalities, privileges, and intersecting factors that come into play across different contexts and populations."},{"instruction":"On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

A:","output":"Ivo Andrić was born first compared to Peter Ackroyd. In order to better understand the context surrounding the lives of these two prominent writers, let's take a closer look at their biographical information. Ivo Andrić was born on October 9, 1892, in Dolac, a village in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now located within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He was a Yugoslav writer and a key figure in the literary movement of the South Slavic regions, known for his novels, short stories, essays, and poetry. He gained international recognition when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961 for his novel \\"The Bridge on the Drina.\\" Andrić's work often revolves around the culture, history, and identity of the South Slavic peoples and captures the essence of life in the Balkans. On the other hand, Peter Ackroyd was born on October 5, 1949, in London, England. He is a distinguished English biographer, historian, and novelist known for his detailed literary style and vivid exploration of history, particularly that of England and particularly focusing on the city of London. Some of his most notable works include \\"Hawksmoor\\", \\"London: The Biography\\", and \\"The Life of Thomas More.\\" Of note is the fact that Ackroyd has not just been limited to the written word, but has also been involved in television productions that delve into the history and character of his home country. There is a significant difference in their birth years, with Andrić being born 57 years before Ackroyd. Consequently, it is quite clear that Ivo Andrić was born first, well before Peter Ackroyd entered the world and began making his own mark in literary history."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The alien influence on ancient civilizations Throughout history, there have been numerous reports, folklore, and theories suggesting that extraterrestrial beings may have had an influence on ancient civilizations. Ancient structures, such as the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, Stonehenge in England, and the Nazca Lines in Peru, have long been marveled at for their intricate and precise construction. The origin and purpose of these structures have mystified archaeologists and historians, prompting theories that ancient cultures may have been guided or inspired by extraterrestrials. There are also many ancient texts and artifacts that seem to reference otherworldly beings interacting with human civilizations. The idea that aliens may have visited, influenced, or even lived amongst ancient societies is an interesting concept to explore, and the possibility of uncovering further evidence in support of this idea continues to captivate researchers, historians, and enthusiasts alike. Hypothesis: Ancient civilizations had technological and cultural advancements due to extraterrestrial interactions and guidance. The hypothesis proposes that extraterrestrial beings had a direct impact on the advancements of ancient civilizations, leading to an acceleration in the development of technology, architecture, and cultural achievements. This hypothesis seeks to explore and interpret the archaeological and historical evidence surrounding ancient structures, artifacts, and texts, as well as the potential connection between such advancements and the possibility of extraterrestrial contact. Key aspects to investigate under this hypothesis include the following: 1. Architectural advancements: The precise construction and alignment of many ancient structures, including the placement of large megaliths, would require knowledge of advanced engineering and astronomical phenomena. Exploring the potential role of extraterrestrial intervention can help explain how these architectural achievements were made possible. 2. Technological advancements: Some ancient civilizations demonstrated advanced knowledge of metallurgy, agriculture, and other technologies that do not align with the chronological development timeline. Uncovering potential extraterrestrial influence on these advancements can provide clarity surrounding their sudden emergence. 3. Art and artifacts: Numerous ancient artifacts and artworks portray beings that resemble extraterrestrial life forms or convey detailed knowledge of astronomical events not yet known to humankind. Investigating these depictions can provide insight into potential extraterrestrial contact and influence on human culture. 4. Ancient texts and myths: Many ancient legends and stories reference otherworldly beings or gods descending from the skies. Examining these myths in the context of extraterrestrial interactions can shed light on potential alien influences within ancient oral and written traditions. By exploring the validity of the hypothesis that ancient civilizations advanced technologically and culturally due to extraterrestrial interactions and guidance, researchers and historians can gain a deeper understanding of our own history and the potential existence of life beyond Earth."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Despite the order, Mr Giggs was widely identified. The High Court heard that he had now consented to being named. It is considering whether he can sue the Sun for alleged breach of privacy. Mr Giggs had been granted an injunction on the basis that TV presenter Ms Thomas appeared to have been trying to blackmail him. However, the 2003 Miss Wales and former Big Brother contestant took legal action against him and, in December 2011, Mr Giggs accepted that she had not been blackmailing him. In court on Tuesday, Mr Giggs's lawyer - Hugh Tomlinson QC - said the injunction that had been supposed to stop his client being identified as the subject of the Sun's story had been breached by thousands of people on the internet. Mr Tomlinson said there had been \\"large scale and continued breaches of the order by a number of malign individuals\\" who had put his client's name in the public domain. Mr Giggs, a former Welsh international who has played for Manchester United for 20 years, was widely identified on social networking sites and in a Scottish newspaper. In May, Lib Dem MP John Hemming also named Mr Giggs during an urgent Commons question on privacy orders. Using parliamentary privilege to break the court order, he said it would not be practical to imprison the 75,000 Twitter users who had named the player. Mr Tomlinson said his client was claiming damages from the Sun for the subsequent re-publication of information in other newspapers and on the internet. \\"He has suffered damage and distress by the chain of events that has been set off by the publication of the article in the Sun,\\" he said. \\"We say the printing of information on the front page of a national newspaper can give rise to an action for misuse of private information.\\" Mr Tomlinson said the Sun article had \\"generated a large media storm\\" and that the damages claim was about \\"providing effective protection\\" for Mr Giggs's right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights.

He was the President of Rwanda, and he wanted to make his country even better and happier. One day, President Kagame discovered the magical world of social media. Social media is like a playground where people from all over the world can share their ideas and pictures, just like in school where kids talk and play together during recess time. President Kagame thought that social media could be a great way to champion democracy and development. Democracy is when people in a country can choose who they want as their leaders and decide the rules they want to follow. Development is when a place gets better, like when they build new parks to play in or give everyone a chance to go to school. The soft-spoken President started using social media, and guess what? He quickly became very popular! He talked to people in Rwanda and even people from faraway places. He shared exciting stories and pictures, and he listened to what other people had to say. Everyone loved how President Kagame was using social media to bring people together and to help make Rwanda better. They could see that he was trying to create a democracy where everyone's voice mattered. He believed that by talking and listening on social media, they could all make Rwanda a place filled with happiness and opportunities. So, as President Kagame continued to explore social media, he showed everyone around the world that a leader could be both kind-hearted and modern. And just like all of the great kings and queens in fairy tales, he worked hard every day to build a better future for the people of Rwanda. And together, they all lived happily ever after in the beautiful land of Rwanda. The end!"},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\"?

Born into slavery in Maryland in 1818, he managed to escape and eventually became a leading figure in the fight against slavery and for equal rights for African Americans and women. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Escaped slavery: In 1838, at the age of 20, Douglass escaped from his life of bondage disguised as a free Black sailor with borrowed identification papers. This was a daring and risky undertaking that would pave the way for his future activism and leadership. 2. Abolitionist leader: Douglass became an influential leader in the abolitionist movement, which sought to end the institution of slavery in the United States. He actively spoke out against slavery at various public meetings and was renowned for his eloquent speeches. 3. Writer and publisher: Douglass published numerous works advocating for the abolition of slavery and equal rights for African Americans. His autobiography, \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\\" published in 1845, is considered a seminal work in African American literature. This account of his life became a bestseller and helped to generate support for the abolitionist cause. Douglass also established the influential newspapers \\"The North Star\\" (1847), \\"Frederick Douglass' Paper\\" (1851), and \\"Douglass' Monthly\\" (1858) to spread the message of abolition and equal rights. 4. Women's rights advocate: Douglass supported the women's suffrage movement and was one of the few men to attend the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention. He co-authored the convention's \\"Declaration of Sentiments\\" and supported the right of women to vote throughout his life. 5. Underground Railroad: Douglass provided assistance and shelter to many escaped slaves as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. He also helped to raise funds for the movement, enabling the escape and relocation of countless individuals seeking freedom from bondage. 6. Civil War recruiter: During the Civil War, Douglass recruited African American soldiers to fight for the Union, including his own sons. He met with President Abraham Lincoln to advise him on issues related to the treatment of African American soldiers and post-war policies aimed at achieving equality for freed slaves. 7. Government appointments: After the Civil War, Douglass held several important government positions, such as president of the Freedman's Savings Bank, which aimed to assist emancipated African Americans with economic stability, and the charge d'affaires for the Dominican Republic. In 1877, he was appointed a U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia. Furthermore, he became the U.S. ambassador to Haiti in 1889, where he served until 1891. 8. Civil rights activism: Throughout his life, Douglass continued to fight for civil rights for African Americans, working tirelessly to promote social justice and equality. One example is his fervent support of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted citizenship to former slaves and African American men's right to vote. In conclusion, Frederick Douglass was a remarkable individual whose achievements spanned numerous domains, including abolition, civil rights, suffrage, and diplomacy. His life and work remain a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the ongoing struggle for justice and equality."},{"instruction":"Q: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Question: Why was there still a possibility of a shutdown? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"There was still a possibility of a government shutdown because after the U.S. House passed the 1.3 trillion spending plan, the bill moved to the Senate, which had a deadline of midnight Friday to approve it. Under Senate rules, a single senator could delay the vote, although they couldn't stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul objected to the short time given to members to read the nearly 2,200-page legislation. As a result, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, and this uncertainty raised the prospect of another brief government shutdown. The situation was further complicated by the fact that lawmakers had just hours to read the lengthy bill, and the budgetary negotiations between Republicans and Democrats were extensive, involving matters such as military funding, immigration agenda, and the U.S.-Mexico border wall. With midterm elections also looming in November, the bill likely marked the final time major legislation would be considered this year.

Police constable Answer:","output":"Title: Bullabbai: The Unlikely Constable Step 1: Establish the protagonist To create a movie plot, first, we need to establish the protagonist. In this case, our protagonist is Bullabbai, a police constable who works in a small town in India. Bullabbai is a kind-hearted and honest man but is often underestimated due to his humble profession and low social status. Step 2: Identify the central theme The central theme of our movie will be the idea of one's profession and social status not defining their worth. The movie will showcase how Bullabbai, despite being a constable, can make a significant impact on his community and beyond. Step 3: Create the setup Bullabbai struggles to get respect from his peers and community due to his profession. One day, he stumbles upon a high-profile kidnapping case, which the local police are unable to solve. Bullabbai sees this as an opportunity to prove his worth and takes on the case, even though it's considered beyond his jurisdiction and expertise. Step 4: Introduce the antagonist An influential and corrupt politician, Ranganath, is behind the kidnapping. He wants to use the hostage as a bargaining chip to get certain policies passed in his favor. Ranganath does everything in his power to thwart Bullabbai's efforts and maintain his facades of respectability. Step 5: Develop conflict As Bullabbai gets closer to solving the case, Ranganath becomes more desperate and resorts to increasingly violent methods to stop him. The local police are also threatened by Bullabbai's progress and reluctant to support him, fearing their incompetence will be revealed. Bullabbai is now caught in a race against time to save the hostage and expose Ranganath's evil deeds. Step 6: Escalate the stakes Ranganath kidnaps Bullabbai's sister to blackmail him into giving up the case. Now, Bullabbai isn't just fighting for the hostage and his community but also for his family's safety. Step 7: Climax In the final showdown, Ranganath and Bullabbai face off. Using his intelligence and resourcefulness, Bullabbai outsmarts Ranganath and rescues both the hostage and his sister. In the process, he also gathers enough evidence to expose Ranganath's crimes and put an end to his reign of corruption. Step 8: Resolution With Ranganath's crimes exposed and the hostages safe, Bullabbai is finally recognized for his courage and integrity. The community, the police, and even the media celebrate him as a hero. Bullabbai is offered a promotion for his exceptional work, proving that one's profession isn't what defines his abilities or worth but rather his actions and character. By following these steps, we have built a movie plot around the question \\"What is Bullabbai's profession?\\" Bullabbai: The Unlikely Constable is a story of an underdog who rises above societal expectations to make a difference and ultimately earns the respect he deserves."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Kai took a fishing trip with a few buddies to get a way.

As the president's motorcade passes, de Gaulle's unarmoured CitroÃ«n DS car is raked with machine-gun fire, but the entire entourage escapes without injury. Within six months, OAS leader Jean Bastien-Thiry and several other members of the plot are captured, and Bastien-Thiry is executed.

Yes The statement \\"Compensation structures in legal services programs anticipate long-term tenure and include pension plans, flexible schedules and benefits that reward longevity\\" directly implies that there are comprehensive payment schemes for legal services that provide pension plans and incentives to stay in the job. These payment schemes aim to attract and retain professionals in the legal services industry by offering them a secure and stable compensation system that considers their long-term commitment to the organization. The compensation structures anticipate an extended tenure, which means employees are expected to work for the firm for a longer period, and in expectation, they provide them with various incentives and rewards. Some of these incentives and rewards include: 1. Pension plans: These are retirement benefit plans that provide employees with a steady income stream after their retirement. By including pension plans in their compensation structure, legal services programs aim to ensure financial security for their workforce upon retirement. 2. Flexible schedules: Flexibility in working hours or schedules accommodates employees' work-life balance needs, leading to higher job satisfaction and reduced attrition rates. By offering this flexibility, legal services programs recognize the importance of maintaining a balance between personal and professional life, which ultimately leads to higher employee retention. 3. Longevity benefits: These benefits reward employees for their long-term commitment to the organization. Longevity benefits can take various forms, including bonuses, promotions, or increased vacation time, provided when employees reach specific milestones in their tenure with the organization.

This setting suits the bandit leader Calvera (Eli Wallach) and provides ample opportunities for action, adventure, and drama. The story will unfold in and around a small, struggling mining town. Step 2: Introduce characters and their relationships - Calvera (Eli Wallach): The ruthless and cunning leader of the bandits, who is feared by everyone, even his own gang members. He is a charming but cruel man, with a sense of humor that borders on sadistic. - Sheriff Johnson: The town's new sheriff, who has recently moved from the East Coast with his family. He is a man of strong morals and values, who wants to bring law and order to this lawless area. - Maria: The daughter of a local mine owner, she is strong-willed, independent, and a skilled horse rider. She has a personal vendetta against Calvera because her father was brutally murdered by Calvera's gang. - The Bandits: A crew of rough and dangerous men who follow Calvera loyally. Step 3: Create the central conflict The central conflict is Sheriff Johnson's struggle to protect the town from Calvera and his bandits. Upon realizing that the bandits are planning to raid the town and take all of its gold, the Sheriff must devise a plan to defend the town and its citizens. Step 4: Introduce subplots and character development - Maria and Sheriff Johnson develop a mutual respect for each other, despite their differing opinions on how to deal with Calvera. Their relationship grows and becomes romantic as they work together to overcome their shared enemy. - Calvera's backstory is gradually revealed, showing that he was once a member of an affluent family who fell into crime after losing everything in a fire that also took the lives of his loved ones. This tragedy has turned him into the cold-hearted, revenge-driven man he is now. Step 5: Build tension and suspense As the day of the anticipated raid approaches, tensions rise in the town. Sheriff Johnson must rally the townspeople, prepare defenses, and outsmart Calvera to protect the town from being destroyed. Step 6: Climactic confrontation In a high-stakes battle, Calvera and his bandits finally attack the town.

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\".

Today, we are going to learn about an exciting thing. It's called a \\"disposable bag fee.\\" But don't worry! I'll explain it in simple words so you can understand. Once upon a time, when people went to shops and bought stuff, they would get free plastic bags to carry their things. But do you know, these plastic bags are dangerous for our planet Earth? This is because they take a very long time to go away and can harm animals and nature. So, some smart grown-ups decided to put a little price on these bags. This price is called a \\"disposable bag fee.\\" When people have to pay for something, they use it carefully, right? Just like how you take care of your toys! Now, let's see how adding a fee to the bags can change the way people shop and help make the Earth a happy place. 1. People bring their own bags: When people know they have to pay for plastic bags, they start bringing their own bags from home. This is great, because they use fewer plastic bags and help save the Earth. 2. People buy fewer things: Sometimes, when there's no extra cost for a bag, people might buy more things because they think the bag is free. But when there's a fee, people only buy what they really need. 3. People reuse bags: Even if they have to buy a plastic bag, people will try to use it again and again, because they paid for it. Reusing things means using fewer new things, and that's good for the Earth. 4. Shops sell better bags: When people have to pay for bags, they want better quality bags. This makes shops start selling bags that can be used many times, which means using fewer plastic bags. At the end of our story, we learned that adding a little price to plastic bags can make a big change! People use less plastic, and the Earth can smile a little brighter.

To combine them, we simply add their coefficients: -31*y + 64*y = (64 - 31) * y = 33*y Now, our equation becomes: -66 = 33*y Step 2: Solve for y. To isolate y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 33: -66 / 33 = 33*y / 33 This simplifies to: -2 = y So, the solution to the equation -66 = -31*y + 64*y is y = -2."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man wearing a black vest and a girl in an orange uniform are waiting at a bus stop.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man waits for the bus.\\"?

One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form. Paragraph: A scientist is testing chemical reactions. At first he tries mixing two chemicals together at a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius and labels it Trial A. He records the time for the reaction to complete at 2 minutes. Knowing that this isn't the temperature users at home will be combining the chemicals at he tries the reaction again at a more modest 65 degrees Celsius and labels this trial B. Noting this temperature the reaction takes almost 4 times as long which is completely unacceptable, He then gets an idea to add and enzyme designed specifically for these two chemicals and then tries the reaction at the modest 65 degrees Celsius again calling this one trial C Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given that this enzyme is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in this experiment, will the reaction for trial C be faster or slower than the reaction in trial B?","output":"Given that the enzyme is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in this experiment, the reaction for trial C at 65 degrees Celsius with the enzyme added will be faster than the reaction in trial B, which was conducted at the same temperature but without the enzyme. This is because enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting, making the process more efficient and faster."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What documentary did the environmental writer for The Guardian work on?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having fewer flowers resulting in less wax being stored within a hive can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me explain this in more detail. The process of bees storing wax, as mentioned in your question, involves finding a perfect spot such as hollow areas of trees, chewing wax, and building honeycombs where they will store nectar, honey, and pollen. The wax production is primarily dependent on the bees themselves, who chew and soften the wax to construct the honeycomb structure. Now, when there are fewer flowers available, it does not directly impact the wax production or the steps involved in constructing the honeycomb. However, it does have an indirect effect on the process. With fewer flowers, the bees have limited sources of nectar and pollen, which are essential for their nutrition and energy needs. Bees use the nectar obtained from flowers to make honey, which serves as their primary food source, and pollen acts as a protein source that helps them produce wax. So, when there are fewer flowers, bees might struggle to gather enough nectar and pollen. This could lead to fewer resources for bees to convert into honey and less energy to produce wax. It may cause the bees to slow down their wax production and honeycomb construction because the overall resources available to the colony are reduced. Additionally, it could also lead to a smaller and weaker colony, ultimately negatively affecting the bees' honey and wax storage process. Therefore, the issue of fewer flowers can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process (specifically, the wax and honeycomb construction part), as it creates repercussions that affect the bees' energy and resource allocation, ultimately leading to less wax being stored."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"30 July 2009 Broadcast'09 reaches the 6,000 net square meters of exhibition\\" to Spanish.","output":"\\"Transmisión del 30 de julio de 2009, 'Broadcast' 09 alcanza los 6,000 metros cuadrados netos de exposición\\" es un frase en español que tiene lo mismo significado.

Baquer Namazi, a former United Nations Children’s Fund official and the father of Siamak Namazi, was taken into custody on Monday, his wife, Effie Namazi, announced in a Facebook post. Ms. Namazi said she believed her husband, also an American citizen, had been taken to Tehran’s infamous Evin Prison, where their son has been in custody since October. “This is a nightmare I can’t describe,” Ms. Namazi wrote. Mr. Namazi’s arrest came on the heels of the recent prisoner exchange between the United States and Iran that did not include his son, a business consultant. Four Iranian-Americans, including Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter, were freed as were seven prisoners held by the United States. The exchange occurred as the accord that limited Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of Western sanctions was about to go into effect. Photo But Siamak Namazi’s arrest, and the failure of Tehran’s government to release him, frightened other Iranian-Americans who had hoped that the nuclear deal might herald a new era of warmer relations and business opportunities. Some of them canceled trips to Iran, waiting for his release or at least to learn why he had been taken into custody in the first place. Citing privacy considerations, the State Department on Wednesday said it did not plan to release any information about Baquer Namazi’s arrest. “We are aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in Iran,” Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement. But at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican asked Secretary of State John Kerry about Mr. Namazi’s arrest. “I am very familiar with this and I am engaged on it specifically, but I am not permitted due to privacy reasons to go into details here,” Mr. Kerry said, according to a transcript provided by the State Department. Ms. Namazi said that neither she nor a lawyer had been able to find out about Mr. Namazi’s status. The lawyer, she added, was unable to get permission to see Mr. Namazi, a former Unicef representative in Kenya and Egypt. She said Mr. Namazi has a serious heart condition as well as other health problems that require medication. The elder Mr. Namazi’s detention came as Iran prepares for parliamentary elections on Friday. The elections have heightened tensions between hard-liners, who control the judiciary and the powerful clerical councils, and reformers. It was unclear if that acrimony had anything to do with the arrest. Siamak Namazi had been visiting Iran when he was arrested. He grew up in Iran, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt and the United States, studying international relations at Tufts and urban planning at Rutgers. He returned to Iran in 1999 as a consultant for foreign businesses, and in 2007 he moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. While working for Unicef in Egypt in 1994, Baquer Namazi survived at attack by Islamist militants who opened fire on two cars traveling in the southern part of the country, killing four police officers and an aid worker. ||||| WASHINGTON -- Iranian authorities have arrested a U.S. citizen whose son has been detained in Iran for the last four months, friends and family said Wednesday, describing what would be the first such action against an American national in Iran since last month's prisoner swap between the two countries. Baquer Namazi, whose son Siamak has been held since October, was arrested on Monday, his wife wrote in a Facebook post. She said she was told he is now in Tehran's Evin prison. \\"I must share the shocking and sad news that Baquer was arrested,\\" Effie Namazi posted. \\"Now both my innocent son Siamak and my Baquer are in prison for no reason. This is a nightmare I can't describe.\\" CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan confirmed Baquer Namazi's arrest. Effie Namazi said she and a lawyer have been unable to get more information or see her husband, who suffers from \\"serious heart and other conditions\\" that require medication. Appearing at a Senate panel hearing Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said he was engaged on the matter but couldn't comment because of privacy considerations. \\"We are aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in Iran,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. \\"The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas. We take our obligation to assist U.S. citizens abroad seriously.\\" Haleh Esfandiari, a friend of the family and a Mideast expert at the Wilson Center, said Namazi is more than 80 years old and a dual U.S.-Iranian national. \\"I'm in a state of shock,\\" said Esfandiari, who was detained herself in Iran for more than three months in 2007. Her take: \\"They want Siamak to make concessions that he wasn't willing to make.\\" Namazi, she said, worked for the United Nations and at one point as a World Bank consultant, while also being a civil society activist. She described him as a \\"not at all political\\" person who consistently spoke out against U.S.-led economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic. The family lived outside New York for a period after the Islamic Revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah in 1979, though later returned to Iran, she said. According to a Daily Beast article last year, the family has played a key role in trying to bridge ties between the longtime foes. It said Namazi was a governor of the oil-rich province of Khuzestan under the shah who was allowed to emigrate to the U.S. in 1983. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman who similarly advocated a warmer U.S.-Iranian relationship, is thought to have been arrested in October. He is the one U.S. citizen known to be detained in Iran who wasn't included in January's prisoner exchange that saw five Americans freed from Iranian prisons and U.S. sentences, charges or warrants dropped against 21 Iranians. Those allowed to leave Iran included Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian. Iran denies having any knowledge of the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI investigator who disappeared in the country in 2007. Rebecca Cook/Reuters The younger Namazi had been specifically criticized in hardline commentary ahead of his arrest as Iranian conservatives warned against easing hostilities with the U.S. He also had written several articles about international sanctions on Iran. In a 2013 opinion piece published by The International Herald Tribune, he described shortages of medical supplies and urged the West to \\"relax and rationalize\\" the restrictions so such goods could reach Iran. Nations removed many oil, trade and financial sanctions on Tehran after last month's U.N. confirmation that Iran had rolled back its nuclear program in accordance with last year's seven-nation agreement. ||||| Story highlights Namazi is 80 years old, has heart condition and needs medication, his wife said His son is Siamak Namazi, an American businessman arrested in October Before his father's arrest, he was the last confirmed U.S. prisoner detained in Iran Washington (CNN) Six weeks after freeing U.S. citizens in a prisoner swap with the United States, Iran appears to have arrested yet another man whom Washington may take an interest in seeing freed. Baquer Namazi, 80, is the father of American businessman Siamak Namazi, who was detained in October and was not part of last month's exchange. Before his father's arrest, he was the last confirmed U.S. prisoner still being held in Iran. \\"I must share the shocking and sad news that Baquer was arrested in Tehran late evening of 22 February 2016 and as far as I have been told by those who took him taken to Evin prison,\\" she wrote. \\"Now both my innocent son Siamak and my Baquer are in prison for no reason.

Options: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","output":"Based on the premise \\"I heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad,\\" it is not possible to tell whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I heard that the flooding was bad.\\" Therefore, the answer is option b). To explain this in more detail, the premise mentions the presence of rain in a particular area, but it does not provide concrete information about the impact, severity, or duration of the rainfall. The phrase \\"it's really been that bad\\" does not specifically reference flooding, making it difficult to discern whether the situation has indeed led to drastic consequences such as severe flooding. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses on flooding, which is a possible outcome of heavy or prolonged rainfall. However, it is important to note that not all instances of rainfall result in severe flooding. A variety of factors may influence the likelihood and severity of flooding, such as the area's landscape, drainage systems, and the amount of rainfall over time. In this case, since the premise does not provide enough information about the direct impacts of the rain on the area or the severity of the resulting flooding, it is not possible to confirm the hypothesis solely based on the given premise.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina).

The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. It hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the Soviet Union would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange.

Estimates suggest that over 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, causing harm to marine life, introducing toxins into the food chain, and contributing to climate change. One of the most significant sources of plastic pollution is single-use plastics, which include items such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging materials. Governments, researchers, and environmental organizations have been exploring various solutions to tackle this issue, including recycling, implementing plastic bans, and promoting biodegradable alternatives. One proposed solution is to introduce an environmentally friendly, biodegradable alternative to single-use plastics, called bio-based polymers or bioplastics. Hypothesis: The large-scale implementation of bioplastics in place of traditional single-use plastics has the potential to significantly reduce the negative environmental impacts associated with plastic pollution. By replacing single-use plastics with biodegradable and eco-friendly alternatives, the amount of plastic waste generated would decrease, and any remaining waste would degrade safely without harming the environment or local ecosystems. This transition would not only protect marine life but also reduce the introduction of toxins into the food chain and combat the effects of climate change. Additionally, public awareness and support for environmentally friendly alternatives would likely increase, leading to further reductions in plastic consumption and improvements in overall environmental health."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to deal with joint pain Research the main symptoms of joint pain to create an accurate diagnosis.

My family and I had been looking forward to visiting this apparent haven after hearing amazing reviews and the promises of tranquility and beautiful scenery. However, upon visiting Serenity Gardens, it became glaringly clear that the actual experience was far from what we had anticipated. Here is a detailed account of our incredibly disappointing encounter. Upon arrival at Serenity Gardens, the first issue we faced was the challenging parking situation. The parking lot was both small and difficult to navigate, which meant we were already stressed and exasperated before even setting foot in the actual establishment. This was not an ideal way to begin our visit to a place that was meant to envelop us in serenity. When we entered the gardens, we immediately noticed how overcrowded and claustrophobic they were. Hundreds of people were squeezed into the small pathways, with numerous large groups enjoying their own picnics and get-togethers on the lawn. Children were running in every direction, loud music played from varying sources, and the noise of ongoing construction seemed endless. The layout of Serenity Gardens was also far from ideal. The walkways were designed with no clear direction, which led to quite a bit of confusion when navigating. Visitors were invariably bumping into each other and struggling to find their way. To make matters worse, there were not enough seating areas or benches for guests to sit down and relax – a significant oversight for a place that claims to offer tranquility and peace. Consequently, many people were forced to sit on the ground, which was damp and poorly maintained. Speaking of poorly maintained, the state of the washrooms left much to be desired. They were both unclean and few in number, resulting in long queues and less than ideal sanitary conditions. This oversight speaks volumes about the management’s attention to detail and overall competence in maintaining Serenity Gardens. Another critical factor contributing to our disappointing experience was the less than ideal customer service. The staff appeared to be overworked and uninterested in the needs of the guests. They seemed unapproachable, leaving us hesitant to inquire about any aspect of the gardens or seek assistance. This lack of amiable service ultimately contributed to our overall dissatisfaction with Serenity Gardens. Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of our visit was the sheer lack of beauty in the gardens themselves. The flowers were overgrown, the grass was uneven, and the bodies of water were murky and unclean. This sorry state of affairs was a far cry from the vivid colors and picturesque surroundings that had been advertised on the garden’s website. Visitors expect to see a well-groomed and pristine setting when visiting a venue like Serenity Gardens, and our expectations in that regard were not met. In summary, Serenity Gardens was a massive disappointment that fell short in nearly every area – from the insufficient parking space, the overcrowded and poorly planned walkways, the unclean washrooms, the lackluster customer service, to the complete absence of serenity that its name ostensibly offers. My family and I will not be returning to visit Serenity Gardens, and we cannot recommend it to others in good conscience. If you are in search of peaceful surroundings and a serene getaway, look elsewhere – Serenity Gardens simply doesn’t deliver."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

Destination: Countries with high healthcare costs or where your existing insurance coverage is limited may require additional travel insurance. 2.

Age and health: Older travelers or those with pre-existing medical conditions might need to purchase additional travel insurance to cover expenses related to their health needs. 4. Activities: If you plan on participating in adventure sports or other high-risk activities, it is essential to have additional insurance coverage in case of injury or accidents. 5. Risks and uncertainties: Things like trip cancellations, lost luggage, or travel delays might make travel insurance a wise investment to protect your financial interests. You can obtain travel insurance through various sources, such as travel agents, insurance brokers, or specialized travel insurance providers. It is important to shop around, compare quotes, and read the fine print to ensure that you are getting the coverage you need at the best price possible.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","output":"Based on the review: \\"Like this aap\\", it appears that the individual had a generally positive experience with the application in question. However, to make an informed recommendation, it is important to consider additional context and details about the app. Factors such as functionality, user experience, price, and personal preferences, among others, should be considered. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I'll assess each of the options you've listed. 1. Not at all: Since the given review is positive, this option seems unlikely. It would only be plausible if additional negative information about the app is obtained, making the single positive review moot. 2. No: Although the review is positive, this answer could suit a person who tends to require more evidence, reviews, or firsthand experience before making a recommendation. Without more context or multiple reviews to analyze, it might be difficult for them to wholeheartedly endorse the app. 3. Maybe: This is a plausible option. The positive review does indicate that the individual enjoyed the app, but with only one review as a basis, it's hard to say if it will appeal to a wider audience. The 'Maybe' option allows for the fact that the app has a favorable review, but also acknowledges that more information is needed to make a well-informed decision. 4. Yes: Given that the review is positive, the 'Yes' answer is a reasonable choice. If someone were to suggest the app based on this single review, it means they trust the opinion of the reviewer and feel that the app is potentially something a friend might enjoy as well. 5. Definitely: This option seems overly enthusiastic, considering there is only one positive review to base the decision on. Endorsing an app as a 'Definitely' would typically require more evidence or personal experience that indicates its excellence and how it caters to diverse user groups. In conclusion, the most appropriate response based on the provided review is 'Maybe.' It acknowledges the positive review but also recognizes the need for additional information to evaluate the app more thoroughly."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: There are lots of dangerous and terrible insects in Northeastern India, but the tree-bees are the most terrible. They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?

You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck?

The discovery of these paintings by four French boys in 1940 also serves as an interesting anecdote to introduce the topic, which further reinforces the significance of these caves and their artwork."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

It is the time when I realize that the books my English teacher assigned to me are not going to read themselves and that I have a difficult month in front of me. You might think that I don't want to spend my summer reading, but that's not the problem: I love reading. On the first day of my summer holidays this year, I went to the library and got \\"A Gathering of Old Men\\" by African-American writer Ernest Gaines. I enjoyed it very much. I read all the magazines that my parents subscribe to and spend about 30 minutes every day with the morning paper. So why do I hate summer reading for school? Because the books on summer reading lists are often slow-going and just uninviting. Teachers and librarians don't understand that summer reading can be entertaining as well as educational. They choose books that a friend of my mother's calls \\"spinach books\\": good for you, but not much fun to take in. Every summer, I read them, hate them and get bitter about the experience. This bitterness started three years ago when I was about to begin high school. As preparation, my English teacher told me to read \\"The Age of Innocence\\" by American author Edith Wharton. I'm sure there are many people who enjoyed \\"The Age of Innocence\\"--some might even say it's their favorite book. But I don't think any of these people read it as a 14-year-old boy on his summer vacation. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" is the story of a forbidden romance in prefix = st1 /New York100 years ago. At 14, my only experience with romance was my love for baseball. I couldn't imagine being in love, much less being in love in 1900. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" was totally different to my life. Most of my required summer reading has been like that--books written in a style that plays up the adjectives and plays down the verbs. I guess teachers don't think exciting plots make for \\"good literature\\". To me, though, a good writer describes events and characters in a way that makes the reader want to know what happens next. If I were making up... Question: In the opinion of the author of this passage, a good writer should be _ .

Pick from: a). Yes; b). It's impossible to say; c). No; Hypothesis: No vessels are renamed after capture.","output":"c). No; The hypothesis stating that no vessels are renamed after capture is incorrect based on the information provided in the paragraph. According to the details mentioned, the HMS \\"West Florida\\" underwent a name change to Gálveztown after being captured by the USS \\"Morris\\" during the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain. It is essential to consider historical records of naval actions to understand that this was a common practice in those times. When a ship was captured by an adversary during a naval battle or skirmish, it was customary for the victorious party to claim the vessel as a prize and incorporate it into their naval fleet. This practice allowed the victor to strengthen its naval force and undermine the enemy in terms of resources. Renaming a captured ship after the battle was a way to claim the ship as one's own and assign it a place in the new navy's fleet, establishing this vessel as reborn under a different flag and allegiance. In the case of the HMS \\"West Florida\\", which was captured by the Continental Navy's USS \\"Morris\\" during the Battle of Lake Pontchartrain, renaming the vessel Gálveztown served more than one purpose. First, it was an acknowledgment of the ship's capture and its subsequent incorporation into the winning side's fleet. Second, Gálveztown was also named supposedly in honor of Bernardo de Gálvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana during that period. This act of renaming could have been done to recognize and commemorate the contributions of Gálvez and his role in supporting the fight against the British. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that no vessels are renamed after capture does not hold true, as the example provided in the paragraph clearly illustrates the renaming of the HMS \\"West Florida\\" after its capture."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Visage were a British synthpop band, formed in London in 1978. The band became closely linked to the burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement of the early 1980s, and are best known for their hit \\"Fade to Grey\\" which was released in late 1980. In the UK, the band achieved two Top 20 albums (Visage and The Anvil) and five Top 30 singles before the commercial failure of their third album (Beat Boy) led to their break-up in 1985. The band has seen various line-up changes over the years, all fronted by vocalist Steve Strange, who resurrected the band name in the 2000s. Steve Strange reappeared on the music scene in 2002, after several years of battling a heroin addiction and other personal problems. He performed several Visage songs on the Here and Now Xmas Tour - a revival of 1980s pop acts. Some time after the performance, Strange decided to create a \\"Mark II\\" of Visage with people from several electronic bands and projects: Steven Young, Sandrine Gouriou and Rosie Harris from Seize and Ross Tregenza from Jetstream Lovers/Goteki. After the announcement of the formation of the new line-up and several television appearances, plans for reworking old material and releasing a new record made slow progress. An updated version of \\"Fade to Grey\\" was produced in 2005. In 2006, Strange also collaborated with the electronic duo Punx Soundcheck and provided vocals on the track \\"In the Dark\\", which was included on the duo's debut double album When Machines Ruled the World. The first Visage mk II track was released in 2007, entitled \\"Diary of a Madman\\". Written by Strange with Visage mk II member Ross Tregenza, the track was co-produced by original Visage member Dave Formula. This song was made available for download from their official website in return for a donation to the charity Children in Need. However, no further new material surfaced from this line-up. The long-since deleted Visage VHS video collection was repackaged for release on DVD in Summer 2006, though it was mistakenly titled Visage Live. In 2008, Strange (and Visage II keyboardist Sandrine Gouriou) made an appearance in the BBC drama series Ashes to Ashes which is set in 1981. In it, they performed the song \\"Fade to Grey\\" in a scene set in the \\"Blitz\\" nightclub. In 2009, Strange and Egan appeared in Living TV's Pop Goes the Band, a series in which pop stars from the 1980s are given a complete makeover in return for a one-off performance. The Visage episode aired on 16 March 2009, and was the first time that the two men had spoken in over 20 years. The episode focused (like others in the series) more on getting them fit in the gym than on the current state of their relationship, though they appeared to get on well enough. At the culmination of the episode, they performed \\"Fade to Grey\\". In 2010, new remixes of \\"Fade to Grey\\" were produced by club DJs Michael Gray and Lee Mortimer to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the song. The remixes were included on a new compilation album, The Face - The Very Best of Visage, which was released in March 2010.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When thinking about consuming raw chicken, we must consider the potential health risks associated with this practice. Unlike some raw fish, which can be safely consumed in the form of sushi or sashimi, eating raw chicken poses significant risks due to the presence of harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. These bacteria can cause severe foodborne illnesses, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and fever. Cooking chicken thoroughly helps kill these bacteria, making it safe for consumption. Additionally, chicken has a different texture and taste when it's raw, which many people may find unpleasant. Even though some cultures or dishes might involve partially cooked or raw chicken, it's essential to be aware that the risk of foodborne illness remains high, and consuming such dishes is not recommended, especially for those with weaker immune systems like children, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems. It's also important to practice proper food handling and hygiene when preparing raw chicken to prevent cross-contamination with other food items and surfaces. Considering these factors, including the potential to contract severe foodborne illnesses and the generally lower culinary appeal of raw chicken, it cannot be deemed safe to consume it without cooking.

I don't think that nails work better than screws because the","output":"first step in determining the most suitable fastener for a particular job is to consider the materials being joined and the strength required for the connection. In this case, nails may not work better than screws because they lack the thread that provides greater gripping power and added stability to the materials being fastened. Additionally, screws are generally better at resisting withdrawal forces due to their helical threads, which provide increased friction and resistance against being pulled out. This is an essential factor for ensuring that the joined materials can withstand forces such as wind, earthquakes, or general wear and tear. Moreover, screws offer greater precision and adjustability in the installation process, allowing for more controlled and accurate fastening. This precision is particularly beneficial when working with delicate or sensitive materials that are prone to splitting or damage under excessive pressure. Lastly, screws can be more easily removed and reinstalled without causing significant damage to the materials being joined, making them a more versatile and desirable choice for projects that may require adjustments or repairs in the future. In summary, I don't think that nails work better than screws because the latter offer superior gripping power, resistance to withdrawal forces, increased precision in installation, and the ability to be easily removed and reinstalled without causing substantial damage to the materials being joined."},{"instruction":"The Ulster Gazette reports the move in its update on the £25m redevelopment of Armagh Gaol, an imposing Georgian building which dates back to 1780s. In a plan unveiled almost a decade ago, it is to be transformed into a boutique hotel, retail units and housing. But the paper understands there is a £2m shortfall. It reports that there's a back-up plan, should the project remain in limbo. One of the alternatives is to relocate council offices from the Archbishop's Palace to the former prison, freeing up the palace for other purposes. The Ulster Gazette's front page is dedicated to schoolboy John Joe Toner, who died from a suspected heart condition. The 11-year-old died five days after collapsing in school and the paper said the village of Clady \\"came to a standstill for one of its darkest days\\". The chapel was \\"packed to overflowing\\" and mourners heard his death was a \\"terrible tragedy for the whole community\\". The border is the main concern for the Fermanagh Herald. It says officials in the Republic of Ireland are already identifying sites along the county's border to locate post-Brexit checkpoints. The paper says while the checkpoints will initially involve stops on commercial vehicles on main roads, the suggestion of cameras being placed \\"on the dozens of country roads criss-crossing the border\\" is causing local concern. But all the talk of the town has been that fiver - the one engraved with the tiny Jane Austen picture and worth an estimated £50,000. Four new plastic notes were engraved by artist Graham Short and spent in each of the home countries last year. And it turns out the artist had spent one of them in Charlie's Bar in Enniskillen. It was found by a County Donegal woman who returned it to the Scottish gallery it came from, saying she wanted any money raised from its sale to be used to help young people. Charlie's owner Gerry Burns said there had been \\"some craic in the bar\\" since the news got out. The Herald says many locals are \\"kicking themselves\\" for not examining their cash more thoroughly. In case you wondered, Mr Short bought a pint of Guinness in the bar. The Newry Reporter carries an exclusive on its front page - train services to and from Newry rail station will increase from this summer. It says additional early morning and late night services to and from Belfast are to be introduced on weekdays, with extra trains also planned for Saturdays. Elsewhere in the city, Newry Leisure Centre was forced to close its doors three times in the space of just 10 days, the paper reveals. It lists the reasons as a hydraulic acid spill in the plant room, a burst water pipe, and a more human error - nobody who had a key was available to open the centre. With a week to go, there are eight pages of election coverage in the Reporter, including in-depth interviews with many of the party leaders. In County Antrim, the Ulster Star leads with concerns over scrambler safety following the death of a man in a crash at Sprucefield. Lisburn man Ryan Phillips died after a collision involving two off-road motorbikes last weekend. The paper reports that Lisburn and Castlereagh Council is currently in talks to create a \\"properly regulated off-road motorsports facility\\" to prevent a repeat of the accident. Staying in Lisburn, residents in the Ballymacash area of the city have been kicking up a bit of a stink in a long-running dispute with NI Water. A \\"foul sewage odour\\" has led to repeated complaints, with one resident telling the company: \\"You've investigated several times over the years and never resolved this daily menace. The residents are sick of it.\\" NI Water assures the paper that it takes the concerns seriously and is to \\"review the history of odour problems at Ballymacash Road\\". The Londonderry Sentinel leads with a group of residents who are fed up with the state of their \\"patchwork\\" road and are taking matters into their own hands. A Strathfoyle \\"community empowerment\\" worker tells the paper his group are lobbying Transport NI to resurface Stradowen Drive, which has more than 30 \\"defects\\". He says the campaign has secured support from 100% of all 60 households on the street. Inside the paper, there's a call for Derry's women to dust off their wedding dresses for a record-breaking third time. In 2013, the city broke the world record for the biggest number of brides in the same place at the same time. Derry lost its tiara to the Chinese province of Guangdong last year, but the Sentinel says the city now wants the record back. So the date's been set, the invitations have gone out, and \\"Brides Across the Bridge\\" will return to the banks of the Foyle on 29 April. In Omagh, a violent assault on a couple as they walked home after a night in the town makes for grim reading in the Tyrone Constitution. It reports that Dwayne Bratton and his fiancee were attacked by a gang of up to eight men on High Street last weekend. Mr Bratton's sister tells the paper they are traumatised after the gang \\"repeatedly beat and kicked him until he was knocked unconscious\\". On a happier note, the paper joins in the birthday celebrations of a 100-year-old girl guide who once partied with Winston Churchill. Doreen Russell, who was born in Strabane on 21 February 1917, still enjoys a list of hobbies and clubs that could tire out 20 of today's twenty-somethings. Having worked in England during World War Two, she casually name-drops this bombshell: \\"I was fire watching at night and I met Winston Churchill, because I was invited to a party and he was there.\\" The sprightly centenarian, who could give most Millennials a run for their money, still fundraises for the Girl Guides and tells the paper that her secret to long life is working hard. \\"Always keep going with the young people, keep busy and don't ask yourself if you can do something, just do it.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article talks about different local news stories reported by various newspapers in Northern Ireland.

They are here paying tribute to the 12 victims of Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo, which has its offices on this street. People whisper or just stand in silence, reading the messages which plaster the walls or nestle among the candles and heaps of flowers. Some who arrive stand very still, observing their own personal minute's silence, while police riflemen guard the street as if it houses an eternal flame. There is so much grief for the slaughtered cartoonists, whose most outrageous caricatures dot the makeshift memorial, refusing to be erased. As mourners walk away, some of them explain why they are there. Because they have friends in Paris who are simply \\"inconsolable\\", says the genial man who arrived from Lille with his wife. Happy to be photographed, the couple nevertheless decline to give their names. \\"And we will go to the demonstration as free men,\\" he says. \\"Freedom and freedom of speech, which are essential to a democracy, have been put into question by this disaster.\\" Then he grins as he points out that someone has pasted a new name on the street sign for the alley where we stand at the end of Rue Nicolas Appert.

Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour.

There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase.

The service, called Maven, debuted Thursday in Ann Arbor, Mich., and will initially focus on serving students and faculty at the University of Michigan. GM vehicles are to be available at 21 spots throughout the city. Users can rent a car through a free smartphone app, which is also used to unlock the vehicle, GM said. See more of our top stories on Facebook >> The company said Maven would expand to additional cities later this year. “With the launch of our car-sharing service through Maven, the strategic alliance with ride-sharing company Lyft and building on our decades of leadership in vehicle connectivity through OnStar, we are uniquely positioned to provide the high level of personalized mobility services our customers expect,” GM President Dan Ammann said in a statement. GM and other major car manufacturers have been exploring new ways to move toward an automotive future in which substantial numbers of drivers will not own cars. In June, Ford launched a car-sharing program that offers buyers a new way to offset the pains of ownership by tapping into what is essentially an Airbnb on wheels — letting strangers rent their cars for short periods of time. In Germany, GM previously had launched a Car-Unity app that lets owners of any brand rent their vehicles to Facebook friends or to people in the app’s network. Other companies are testing the waters. BMW has said it plans to offer an optional equipment package for cars from its Mini brand that will help owners share their vehicles. The company hasn’t detailed the technology, but it probably will give renters access to unlock and drive the cars through a smartphone app or other device. “Society and the automotive industry are undergoing radical change,” said Peter Schwarzenbauer, who heads BMW’s Mini and Rolls-Royce brands. “So it makes sense for us to offer a car-sharing option for Mini starting in 2016.” Bob Carter, who heads Toyota’s U.S. sales, says his company is gauging how car- and ride-sharing companies such as Uber will affect their business. In San Francisco, for example, “we will see business models develop around access to cars but not ownership,” he said. Analysts cautioned that although GM’s move is a bold one, it’s only another iteration in the transforming transportation industry. “The Maven launch will give GM broader reach in this dynamic atmosphere, but nobody knows which of these alternative transportation systems holds the greatest long-term potential,” Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said. “This is why we’re seeing a shotgun approach coming from multiple automakers.” The launch of Maven comes days after the news that GM acquired the assets of ride-hailing company Sidecar Technologies Inc. The San Francisco company had shut down at the end of last year. Also this month, GM invested 500 million in the ride-sharing service Lyft. The automaker will also take a seat on Lyft’s board, and the two companies plan to collaborate on an Autonomous On-Demand Network that would allow users to reserve a self-driving car, much as they do with Lyft. Separately on Thursday, GM announced its financial results for 2015. The company reported global sales of 9.8 million vehicles in 2015, representing a third straight year of growth for the Michigan-based automaker. New vehicle deliveries in North America rose 6% from a year earlier. In China, they rose 5%. For more business news, follow @smasunaga. For automotive news, follow @MisterFleming.

The service debuts in Ann Arbor, Michigan, focusing initially on serving students and faculty at the University of Michigan, with GM vehicles available at 21 locations throughout the city. Users can rent a car through a free smartphone app, which is also used to unlock the vehicle. GM said that Maven would expand to additional cities later in the year. This is another move by GM to explore new ways of providing vehicle services and move towards a future where a significant number of drivers will not own cars."},{"instruction":"Question: what is a typical annuity premium I found the following answer on Google: However, the majority of modern annuity customers use annuities only to accumulate funds free of income and capital gains taxes and to later take lump-sum withdrawals without using the guaranteed-income-for-life feature.

Movie title: A Streetcar Named Desire Context: Under mysterious circumstances, Blanche DuBois, an aging high school teacher, leaves her home in Auriol, Mississippi to travel to New Orleans to live with her sister, Stella Kowalski. She arrives on the train and boards a streetcar named \\"Desire\\" and reaches her sister's home in the French Quarter where she discovers that her sister and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, live in a cramped and dilapidated two-room apartment in an old New Orleans tenement. Blanche and Stella are all that remain of an old aristocratic family. Blanche discloses that the family estate, Belle Reve, has been lost to creditors, and that she wants to stay with Stella and Stanley for a while. Blanche seems lost and broke, with nowhere to go. Stella welcomes her with an open heart. From the start, Blanche and Stanley are wary of each other. Blanche has a soft-spoken manner; Stanley is rough and loud. His mere presence seems to threaten her, while her behavior and manner arouse suspicion in him. She is especially adroit at patronizing and criticizing Stella from the start. When interrogated about her past, struggling to be polite, Blanche says that she was married and widowed at a young age. She says that she has taken a leave of absence from her job due to her nerves. To satisfy Stanley's skepticism about the loss of the estate, Blanche hands over her papers pertaining to Belle Reve. But Stanley grabs at some of her private papers that she is holding back, and they cascade to the floor. Weeping, she gathers them all back, saying that they are poems from her dead husband. He defends himself by saying that he was just looking out for his family, and then announces that Stella is going to have a baby. Soon after her arrival, Stanley has a poker night with his friends where Blanche meets Mitch. His courteous manner sets him apart from Stanley's other friends. They like each other right away. This is the start of their romance. Stanley explodes in a drunken rage, striking Stella, and sending his friends running, while Blanche and Stella flee...

This will help you understand how to make it and the process behind the recipe. Step 1: Gather the ingredients To follow naive physics reasoning, we need to start by gathering the ingredients required for making a fruit salad dressing. We'll need some citrus, such as lemon or lime juice, a sweetener like honey or sugar, and optionally, a little vanilla extract or cinnamon for extra flavor. Step 2: Measure the ingredients With the ingredients in hand, we need to measure them to create the right balance of flavors. Here's a suggested ratio: - 1/4 cup of citrus juice (lemon or lime) - 2 tablespoons of sweetener (honey or sugar) - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional) - 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional) Step 3: Combining the ingredients Now we need to combine the ingredients in a way that ensures equal distribution of flavors throughout the dressing. Since liquids (like citrus juice) can mix with other liquids (like honey) easily, we can use a whisk to mix the ingredients in a bowl. Step 4: Adjust the sweetness or acidity Taste the dressing and adjust the sweetness or acidity if needed, by adding more honey or citrus juice. This conforms to our naive physics reasoning that teaches us that the dressing's flavor profile can be adjusted through the addition of more ingredients. Step 5: Pour the dressing over the fruit salad Finally, pour the dressing over your prepared fruit salad, ensuring even coverage. The logic behind this is that every fruit piece should be coated with the dressing to enhance its flavor. In conclusion, using naive physics reasoning, making an easy fruit salad dressing involves gathering the ingredients, measuring and mixing them, adjusting for taste, and finally, pouring it over the fruit salad for an enhanced flavor profile."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup Final was a football match contested between Barcelona of Spain and Sampdoria of Italy. It was the final match of the 1988–89 European Cup Winners' Cup and the 29th European Cup Winners' Cup Final. The final was held at Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, on 10 May 1989. Barcelona won the match 2–0 thanks to goals by Julio Salinas and Luis López Rekarte. Hypothesis: This was Sampdoria's first loss in the cup.","output":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"This was Sampdoria's first loss in the cup\\" is true, it is necessary to research and analyze Sampdoria's performance and history during the 1988-89 European Cup Winners' Cup and in previous editions of the tournament. Unfortunately, the paragraph provided does not offer enough information to confirm or refute this hypothesis. However, we can seek information from external sources. A quick analysis of the 1988-89 European Cup Winners' Cup indicates that Sampdoria did not lose any matches prior to the final in that edition. In the first two rounds, they defeated Grasshopper of Switzerland and Borussia Mönchengladbach of Germany. In the quarterfinals, Sampdoria defeated Monaco, and in the semifinals, they eliminated Sporting CP of Portugal. In all of these matchups, Sampdoria either won or tied, advancing on away goals or aggregate score. To further evaluate the hypothesis, it is crucial to examine Sampdoria's performance in previous editions of the tournament. Sampdoria had not participated in the European Cup Winners' Cup before the 1988-89 season. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"This was Sampdoria's first loss in the cup\\" is true. In summary, based on the analysis of Sampdoria's performance during the 1988-89 European Cup Winners' Cup and the history of their participation in previous editions, the provided hypothesis is accurate. The 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup Final was indeed Sampdoria's first loss in the competition."},{"instruction":"A High Court judge awarded the payout to Catherine Rooney after deciding that cleaning the cup fell within regulations on work equipment. Mrs Rooney had been washing up in the kitchen area at Anne's Primary School, Londonderry, in March 2011. The court heard that the handle on a mug broke off and sliced into her lower arm, damaging a tendon. She later underwent surgery on her injuries at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and was off work for about a year. She had taken off her gloves while drying the crockery. In her action against the Western Education and Library Board it was accepted that her induction training did not include using gloves while drying items. The claim centred on whether Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 applied to her case. Mrs Rooney's lawyers argued that a cup does constitute equipment, while the defendant contended that it did not come within a list of work tools. Ruling on the action, the judge held that pots, pans, cups and glasses being used to provide food and drink at the school fell within the regulations. \\"This plaintiff cleaning the cup in question was using it, as part of the equipment of the kitchen as it had become, in her capacity as an employee of the defendant at her work,\\" he said. On that basis he held the defendant liable for breach of statutory duty. Dealing with the level of pay-out Mrs Rooney is entitled to, the judge noted she has been left with a permanent scar. He made an award of £25,000 general damages, plus a further £1,944 in special damages. Loss of earnings put at just under £3,776 also featured in the outcome, along with interest and legal costs for the plaintiff.

Die Kommission hat in dieser Hinsicht zweifellos eine wichtige Rolle zu spielen, sowohl in Bezug auf ihr Versprechen und ihre Verantwortung gegenüber dem Europäischen Parlament als auch gegenüber Frauen in Entwicklungsländern. Die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter und die Stärkung der Rolle von Frauen in diesen Ländern sind von entscheidender Bedeutung, da sie einen signifikanten Beitrag zur Entwicklung ihrer Gesellschaften und zur Bekämpfung der Armut leisten können. Daher ist es wichtig, dass sich die Kommission für diese Verpflichtungen einsetzt und ihre Ressourcen und Bemühungen auf die Förderung von Frauenrechten und deren sozioökonomischen Fortschritt konzentriert. In Entwicklungsländern beeinflussen zahlreiche Faktoren das Leben von Frauen nachteilig, darunter eingeschränkte Bildungschancen, unzureichender Zugang zu Gesundheitsversorgung, geschlechtsspezifische Diskriminierung und mangelnde politische Vertretung. Die Europäische Kommission, als eine der größten Geberorganisationen weltweit, hat die einzigartige Möglichkeit, dringend benötigte Ressourcen, technische Unterstützung und politische Impulse für die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität und der Perspektiven von Frauen in diesen Ländern zu mobilisieren. Um dieser Verpflichtung gegenüber Frauen in Entwicklungsländern gerecht zu werden, sollte die Kommission ihre länderspezifischen und thematischen Programme so gestalten, dass sie die besonderen Bedürfnisse und Anliegen von Frauen berücksichtigen und auf ihre grundlegenden Rechte und Freiheiten abzielen. Dies kann erreicht werden, indem man sich auf die folgenden Schwerpunkte konzentriert: 1. Bildung: Verbesserung des Zugangs zu qualitativ hochwertiger Bildung für Mädchen und Frauen, um ihre beruflichen Aussichten und die Fähigkeit zur Teilnahme am öffentlichen Leben zu erhöhen. 2. Gesundheit: Verbesserung des Zugangs zu angemessener Gesundheitsversorgung, insbesondere in den Bereichen sexuelle und reproduktive Gesundheit und Rechte, die für das Wohlergehen von Frauen extrem wichtig sind. 3. Wirtschaftliche Möglichkeiten: Schaffung von Möglichkeiten für Frauen, ihre wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit zu erreichen, z.B. durch den Zugang zu Finanzmitteln, Berufsbildung und Förderung von Unternehmerinnentum. 4. Politische Beteiligung und Führung: Stärkung der politischen Beteiligung von Frauen und der Präsenz von Frauen in Führungspositionen, um ihren Einfluss auf politische Entscheidungsprozesse auszubauen. 5. Bekämpfung von Gewalt gegen Frauen und Mädchen: Umsetzung von Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung und Bekämpfung von Gewalt gegen Frauen und Mädchen, insbesondere in Krisensituationen und Konfliktgebieten. 6. Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Gleichstellung: Sicherstellung, dass Frauen und Mädchen gleiche Rechte und den gleichen Schutz durch die Rechtsordnung erhalten, einschließlich ihres Rechts auf Eigentum und Erbschaft. Die Kommission sollte ihre Zusammenarbeit sowohl mit nationalen Regierungen als auch mit der Zivilgesellschaft in Entwicklungsländern ausbauen, um lokale Kapazitäten zu stärken und die Achtung von Frauenrechten zu fördern. Sie sollte dabei auch darauf achten, die Sichtbarkeit der EU-Förderung und ihrer Ergebnisse in Gesellschaften, in denen Frauenrechte missachtet oder eingeschränkt werden, zu erhöhen.

The Foxtrot is a ballroom dance that has evolved from its early origins of fast-paced rhythms and movements to become an elegant, smooth, and progressive dance. This transformation has allowed it to incorporate various dance elements and patterns from other styles, including Quickstep. Quickstep and Foxtrot both fall under the umbrella of International Style ballroom and are part of the \\"Standard\\" or \\"Modern\\" dances. These two dances share more than just a ballroom dance classification; they also share several characteristics, an important one being the presence of Telemarks. Telemarks are figures in ballroom dancing, characterized by their curved movements and one partner stepping around the other. The name 'Telemark' comes from the resemblance to the curved tracks made by a skier in the Telemark skiing style. Both the Quickstep and the Foxtrot utilize these flowing curved movements, making Telemarks an essential and popular figure in both dances. Telemarks in the Foxtrot are typically executed at a slower pace, allowing dancers to emphasize the smooth and gliding nature of the dance. The Foxtrot is known for its steady, even timing (typically danced at 4/4 time) and the characteristic slowness of some of its steps. This allows for more precise control and blending of figures, making the dance appear refined and graceful. Quickstep, on the other hand, is danced at a faster tempo, with the dancers moving quickly around the ballroom floor. The Telemarks are more dynamic and often combined with other figures, such as the chassé and the lock step. As a result, the quick and lively nature of the dance can add an energetic and spirited dimension to the execution of Telemarks. While Telemarks are common in other ballroom dances as well, it is the Foxtrot's progressive nature and similarity in the overall style that makes it the most closely related dance to the Quickstep in terms of utilizing the curved movements. Both dances showcase elegance and intricacy in their execution of the Telemark figure, despite their differences in tempo and overall mood. In conclusion, Foxtrot is the progressive dance that is characterized by long movements and shares similar Telemarks with Quickstep. It is the combination of their shared heritage in International Style ballroom dancing, their usage of the flowing and graceful Telemark figure, and their elegant nature as smooth ballroom dances that make them the most closely related when considering the incorporation of Telemarks in their choreography."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: AmeriGas, country, United States; United States, leader, Paul Ryan","output":"Step 1: Identify the entities and their attributes - Entity 1: AmeriGas - Attribute 1: Country (United States) - Entity 2: United States - Attribute 1: Leader (Paul Ryan) Step 2: Determine the relationship between the entities - AmeriGas is a company operating in the United States - Paul Ryan is a leader in the United States Step 3: Create a sentence connecting the entities and their attributes AmeriGas, a prominent company in the United States, operates in a country where Paul Ryan holds a significant leadership position."},{"instruction":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: BlueRay Version Review: The Movie is great!If you bought the blue ray to get the recipes they advertise, forget it.

In the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 12.6% of high school students had smoked at least one cigar in the past 30 days. After cigarettes, cigars were the second most commonly used tobacco product in youths and the most commonly used tobacco product among African American high school students. From the CDC’s national Adult Tobacco Survey for 2009-2015, data suggest that prevalence among adults was highest among 18-24 years (15.9%) followed by 25-44 years old (7.2%). From the same survey, prevalence among men (10.4%) was significantly higher than women (3.1%) and likewise among LGBT (12.2%) and heterosexual (6.5%) respondents. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015) indicated that 12.5 million American (over age 12) smoked a cigar product in the past month and over 24 million smoked a cigar product in the past year.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Step 2: Iterate through the string with two nested loops, comparing substrings of different lengths to find palindromes. Step 3: In the outer loop, start from the first character 'p' and go till the second last character 's' (This is because we need at least two characters to form a longer palindrome).

Work: A cubicle is a common type of workstation in many offices and is designed to provide a private workspace for employees. Therefore, you might feel cramped in a cubicle at work. 2. Bank: Banks typically have separate counters or sections for customer service representatives, and while they might use individual workstations, they may not generally use cubicles. Therefore, feeling cramped in a cubicle is less likely in a bank. 3. Constructing office space: During the construction phase of office space, there would not be any cubicles set up. Therefore, feeling cramped in a cubicle during the construction of office space is not applicable. 4. Home office: A home office could potentially have a cubicle or a similar small workspace, depending on the room's design and size.

A:","output":"Michael J. Fox, a renowned Canadian-American actor, author, comedian, and advocate, is living with Parkinson's disease, a long-term degenerative disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. Fox first publicly disclosed his condition in 1998, although he was diagnosed in 1991 at the age of 29. Parkinson's disease develops due to the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a region in the brain that produces the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine plays a vital role in transmitting signals in the brain that control body movement, coordination, and balance. As dopamine levels decrease, individuals with Parkinson's may experience a range of symptoms that worsen over time. The primary motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease include: 1. Tremors: Involuntary shaking, usually starting in the hands and fingers, and eventually involving the arms, legs, and feet. 2. Rigidity: Stiffness or inflexibility in the muscles, impeding smooth movement and causing discomfort. 3. Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement and difficulty initiating voluntary movement, with the overall reduction of mobility and delayed response in daily tasks. 4. Postural instability: Impaired balance, which can lead to difficulty standing straight, falls, and loss of reflexes designed to maintain posture. Parkinson's disease can also present a range of non-motor symptoms such as: 1. Cognitive decline: Difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function, which may progress to dementia in later stages. 2. Mood disorders: Patients can experience depression, anxiety, irritability, and apathy. 3. Sleep disorders: Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, wherein individuals act out their dreams, potentially causing injury. 4. Autonomic dysfunction: This can involve constipation, urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), and sexual dysfunction. 5. Sensory abnormalities: Issues with smell, vision, pain, and other sensory disturbances may be present in Parkinson's disease. In an effort to raise awareness and support related research, Michael J.

In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history. Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by Leeds United. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their \\"lucky\\" yellow and blue strip, which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

Entailment in linguistics is the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one (Sentence A) necessitates the truth of the other (Sentence B). Here, Sentence 1 states: 'Uh oh.' I tapped White on the shoulder. Sentence 2 states: I ignored White. There is no entailment between these two sentences because the action in Sentence 2 (ignoring White) does not necessarily follow from the action in Sentence 1 (tapping White on the shoulder). In fact, they depict contrasting behaviors. One could argue that tapping someone on the shoulder is an act of getting someone's attention rather than ignoring them.

In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering language acquisition, it is important to consider the various methods through which people can be exposed to language content. One such method is watching TV shows and movies in the target language with subtitles. By doing so, learners are exposed to both the auditory and visual aspects of the language, making connections between the spoken words and their meanings. This can help improve vocabulary and comprehension skills, as well as pronunciation and listening abilities. In addition, the engaging nature of entertaining TV shows and movies can help maintain motivation and interest in the language-learning process. While it is true that learning a language solely through watching TV shows and movies may not provide a comprehensive understanding of grammar, or offer opportunities for speaking practice, it can certainly be a valuable supplement to more traditional language learning methods. Therefore, can someone learn a new language by watching TV shows and movies in that language with subtitles?

Since 1998, the band's constant members have been vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: Good Charlotte (2000), The Young and the Hopeless (2002), The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004), Good Morning Revival (2007), Cardiology (2010) and Youth Authority (2016), as well as two compilations: Greatest Remixes (2008) and Greatest Hits (2010). Context: Good Charlotte's fifth album, with the help of former Dear Christie lead singer Adam Markin, was released on November 2, 2010. The album, which was released nearly 6 weeks later than anticipated due to Markin's constant battle with HPV, was an immediate success. Describing the sound to MTV news, Joel Madden said it would sound a lot like Blink-182. Joel Madden went on to say in the same MTV interview that \\"There's nothing dance-y on the record, though, at all, which is different from our last one,\\" further implying a movement away from the sound of Good Morning Revival. On December 3, 2008 Kerrang! magazine announced that Good Charlotte would be releasing its fifth studio album, Cardiology in 2009. The title of which, according to Joel, comes from the lyrical content of the album, which he explained is \\"all connected to the heart\\". Madden also added that the band had already written 20 songs for the new album, and are said to be heading back to their pop-punk roots. On January 24, 2010 Good Charlotte announced that the band had finished the album, but were going to completely scrap it and record with a different producer, Don Gilmore, who also produced the band's first and fourth records, Good Charlotte and Good Morning Revival. The band released its first single \\"Like It's Her Birthday\\" featuring Tonight Alive from the new album on August 24, 2010. The band posted the song online August 5, 2010, and wrote on its website that if the video of the song received more than 100,000 views, the band would post another song from the album. The video reached 100,000 views on August 15, 2010 and the band released \\"Counting the Days\\" as a video on its YouTube channel and announced that it will be the second single from the album. The music video for \\"Like It's Her Birthday\\" has cameos from The Maine's lead singer John O'Callaghan and guitarist Kennedy Brock and Boys Like Girls' lead singer Martin Johnson, and guitarist Paul DiGiovanni. On November 5, 2010, Good Charlotte's former label, Sony Music, released a Greatest Hits compilation for Australia, spanning 16 singles from the band's four studio albums released on that label. The compilation was later released in the US on January 6, 2011, and in Japan on February 16, 2011. On September 13, 2010, it was announced that Good Charlotte will be headlining the 2011 Kerrang! Relentless Tour, with supporting acts Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley, and The Wonder Years. On March 3, 2011, Good Charlotte went on tour with This Century and Forever The Sickest Kids throughout North America. In June 2011 Good Charlotte set out on a U.S. tour co-headlining with Yellowcard and opening act Runner Runner. In June 2011 on an interview with Punkvideosrock.com Billy and Paul stated they were in the process of planning tours for the next 5 years. On September 1, 2011, Good Charlotte announced a hiatus via interview with Rolling Stone, but The Madden Brothers released a free mix tape in October 2011, Before -- Volume One. and their debut album Greetings From California was released in September 2014, which featured Good Charlotte drummer Dean Butterworth as session performer. Question: What happened in 2010? Answer:","output":"In 2010, several significant events occurred concerning Good Charlotte. Firstly, the band worked on their fifth studio album, Cardiology, which had been announced in December 2008 with a planned 2009 release. After initially finishing the album, the band decided to scrap it and rerecord with a different producer, Don Gilmore, who had produced their first and fourth records. The album was eventually released on November 2, 2010, after being delayed by almost six weeks due to Adam Markin's battle with HPV. Joel Madden described to MTV News that the album would sound more like Blink-182 and confirmed that it would not feature any dance-y tracks, moving away from the sound of their previous album, Good Morning Revival. In August 2010, Good Charlotte released the first single from Cardiology, titled \\"Like It's Her Birthday,\\" featuring Tonight Alive. The music video for this track featured cameos by members of The Maine and Boys Like Girls. After the video reached 100,000 views, the band released \\"Counting the Days\\" as their second single. Sony Music, the band's former label, released a Greatest Hits compilation of Good Charlotte's work on November 5, 2010, in Australia. The compilation was later released in the United States and Japan in early 2011. On September 13, 2010, it was announced that Good Charlotte would be headlining the 2011 Kerrang! Relentless Tour, supported by Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley, and The Wonder Years.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Answer: No, it is not a verifiable fact that Cyndi Lauper sounded like a man when she sang. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Firstly, it's essential to recognize that people's opinions about another person's voice are subjective. 2. Cyndi Lauper is a female singer, known for her distinctive voice, which is often described as unique, high-pitched, and powerful. This description, however, does not mean she sounds like a man. 3. There is no objective standard or measurement in place to compare voices and definitively state whether a person \\"sounds like a man\\" or not. 4. People's perceptions of what a typical male or female voice sounds like can be influenced by various factors, such as their cultural background, familiarity with different singing styles, or personal tastes and experiences. 5. Given that opinions around what constitutes a typically \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" voice are highly subjective, it is not possible to verify if Cyndi Lauper indeed sounded like a man when she sang.

The film then cuts to Cairo, Egypt in 1949, where the young Father Lankester Merrin (played by SkarsgÃ¥rd, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in the occupied Netherlands during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who asks him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. â long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa.

First, let's define the Peace of Westphalia. The Peace of Westphalia refers to a series of peace treaties signed in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War and brought stability to the Holy Roman Empire. 2. We need to evaluate whether the Peace of Westphalia marked the beginning of a peaceful era for the Holy Roman Empire. 3. It is true that the Peace of Westphalia brought an end to the Thirty Years' War and established a new political order in the Holy Roman Empire, which included the principle of \\"cuius regio, eius religio,\\" meaning that each ruler could determine the religion of their own state. 4. However, although the Peace of Westphalia brought relative peace to the Holy Roman Empire, it did not eliminate all conflicts and tensions.

Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"Elon Musk first job at Tesla was working in the cafeteria.\\"","output":"Let's clarify and verify the statement in question, step-by-step. Statement: \\"Elon Musk's first job at Tesla was working in the cafeteria.\\" 1. Understanding the statement: The statement suggests that when Elon Musk first joined Tesla, he worked in the company's cafeteria. 2. Background information: Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur and is the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company. He also co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, and The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel construction service. Musk is notably recognized for his involvement with Tesla, Inc., as CEO, product architect, and major shareholder. 3. Verification: Now, let's verify if Elon Musk's first job at Tesla was indeed working in the cafeteria. - Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle and clean energy company founded in 2003. - Elon Musk was not part of the founding members; however, he invested in and joined Tesla in 2004 as the chairman of its board of directors. - In 2008, Musk became the CEO and product architect of Tesla, leading the company to develop electric cars, battery products, and solar energy solutions. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the statement \\"Elon Musk's first job at Tesla was working in the cafeteria\\" is not a verifiable fact. His first roles at Tesla were as an investor and board chairman, followed by CEO and product architect in 2008."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"There were Catholic Monarchs in Europe.\\" Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"There were Catholic Monarchs in Europe\\" is true. Throughout history, many European monarchies adhered to Catholicism as their primary religious faith. The term \\"Catholic Monarchs\\" generally refers to monarchs who upheld the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. I will now provide some background on the role of Catholicism in European monarchies and give some examples of Catholic Monarchs: 1. Development of Catholicism in Europe: Catholicism has played a significant role in shaping European history by influencing politics, culture, and social institutions. The Roman Catholic Church was the dominant religious institution in Europe during the Middle Ages (approximately from the 5th to the 15th century). As Christian kingdoms expanded and solidified their rule in Europe, the Pope, as the head of the Catholic Church, grew to hold a considerable amount of spiritual and political power. 2. Examples of Catholic Monarchs: There are several examples of Catholic Monarchs in Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, France, England, and Hungary. Some of these monarchs include: a. Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile (Spain): Known as the \\"Catholic Monarchs,\\" they were pivotal figures in the 15th century who unified the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile and established the foundation for modern Spain. They also supported the Catholic Church, carried out the Reconquista (the retaking of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors), and conducted the infamous Spanish Inquisition to root out heresy and enforce religious orthodoxy. b. Louis IX (France): Known as \\"Saint Louis,\\" he was a 13th-century king of France, known for his piety and strong commitment to the Catholic Church. He led two Crusades and patronized religious institutions, leading him to be canonized as a saint by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297. c. Charles I (England): Ruling during the early 17th century, Charles I was a devout Catholic who pursued controversial religious policies in a predominantly Protestant nation, contributing to the English Civil War's outbreak in 1642. d. Stephen I (Hungary): Stephen I, or Saint Stephen, was the first king of Hungary, ruling from around 997 to 1038. He played a critical role in the country's Christianization and established Hungary as a Catholic kingdom. In conclusion, Catholic Monarchs have played a significant role in European history, and the statement \\"There were Catholic Monarchs in Europe\\" is true. They were instrumental in shaping the political landscape, religious beliefs, and social institutions in the region."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

The news has left the motorsports community in mourning for a man whose dedication and support helped shape a world champion. **A Devastating Loss:** A statement released by Jenson Button's agent confirmed the tragic news and expressed that the driver was 'devastated' by the loss of his father. John Button was an instrumental figure in Jenson's rise to Formula 1 stardom, using his own background in motorsports to guide and mentor his son from an early age. **The Guiding Force Behind Jenson Button's F1 Career:** John Button, himself a former rallycross driver, recognized his son's potential and relentless determination when Jenson took up kart racing as a child. Demonstrating unwavering support, he set up a go-kart business to provide Jenson with the necessary resources to pursue his passion. The business venture helped fund Jenson's foray into the world of competitive motorsports, paving the way for his son to secure a prestigious seat in the elite Formula 1 racing competition. Jenson would later repay that investment and trust by accumulating 15 Grand Prix wins and a World Championship title to his name. **A Family in Mourning:** Alongside Jenson, John is survived by his three daughters, Natasha, Samantha, and Tanya. The Button family is united in mourning the loss of a beloved father, whose commitment to nurturing Jenson's dreams led to the realization of a remarkable and unforgettable career. **Conclusion:** As the motorsports community comes to terms with the passing of John Button, we are reminded of the pivotal role that dedicated parents and mentors can play in fostering the talents, aspirations, and achievements of the younger generation.

A 9-year-old girl suffered serious injuries Saturday when the jumping castle she was in got caught in a high wind gust and dropped her on a neighbor's roof. Alissa Baray was attending a birthday party at a home in the 7900 block of Ironwood Reserve Way, near North Silverbell and West Twin Peaks roads in Marana, said Capt. Adam Goldberg, a Northwest Fire District spokesman. She and her 11-year-old sister, Jessica, were in the jumping castle when a sudden, intense gust of wind - witnesses described it as similar to a microburst - sent it airborne, Goldberg said. The jumping castle was tied down, but the force of the wind broke the ties, he said. Jessica dropped out shortly after the castle took off, but her younger sister was trapped inside, he said. It flew about 110 feet before it dropped her on a neighbor's roof, he said. Paramedics rescued the child and took both girls to University Medical Center. Jessica had only minor injuries, but Alissa suffered a minor concussion, said the girls' grandmother, Marianne Lucero. She was alert at the hospital Saturday night. \\"She opened her eyes and said, 'I love you grandma',\\" Lucero said.

Eurooppalaiset sekä Venäjä ja Yhdysvallat myivät niille lähes minkälaisia aseita tahansa. Translate to English","output":"We supported these autocracies in many ways. Europeans, as well as Russia and the United States, sold almost any type of weapons to them. In this statement, the author is highlighting the involvement of various powerful countries in supporting autocratic governments around the world. One of the primary ways this support manifested was through the sale of weapons and military equipment. The European countries, along with Russia and the United States, have been major suppliers of arms to these autocracies, essentially helping them maintain their hold on power. These countries provided a wide range of weapons, from small arms and ammunition to more specialized and advanced systems like tanks, aircraft, and missile systems. These sales not only enabled the autocracies to maintain their grip on power by suppressing opposition and controlling their populations, but also often led to human rights abuses and armed conflicts in various regions. The role of these nations in providing arms to autocratic governments has raised some ethical questions, as well. On one hand, it can be argued that supporting autocracies for political or economic reasons is a necessary part of international relations, especially given the complex web of alliances and interests that make up the global landscape. On the other hand, critics argue that enabling autocracies through arms sales and other forms of support indirectly contributes to human rights abuses, ongoing conflicts, and general instability in the affected regions. Additionally, there is the potential for these weapons to end up in the hands of extremist or terrorist groups, further exacerbating the problem. In conclusion, supporting autocratic governments through the sale of weapons presents an ethical dilemma for powerful nations like the European countries, Russia, and the United States. While it may be inevitable within the complex realm of international relations, the implications of such support are far-reaching and have the potential to cause harm, particularly in terms of human rights abuses and prolonged conflicts."},{"instruction":"Turkey Pressed to Move on Cyprus for EU Deal BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union spelled out tough conditions Friday for Turkey to start membership talks next October ahead of final bargaining with the Turkish prime minister at a landmark summit.

Article: The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \\"activity\\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics , strength building, and flexibility exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day. On days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day. Just as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes. Here are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change: Question: The author advises dividing activity into shorter exercise breaks because _ .

Jeffrey was always out of work. Reasoning: The sentence states that financial stability came easier to Joel than Jeffrey. If Joel was always out of work (option 1), it would make it difficult for him to achieve financial stability. Therefore, option 2, stating that Jeffrey was always out of work, provides a logical explanation for Joel's relative ease in achieving financial stability."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story. The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai. None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why? There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them. The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population.

You can use this information to help target other people who have similar interests or who fall into similar demographic groups. If you have a store, pay attention to who your customers are. You may be able to tell a lot about them simply by being observant. You can also try engaging customers in conversation, asking customers to complete surveys, or creating a rewards program that requires the submission of personal information in order to learn more about your current customers. Rewards programs also allow you to track customers' purchases, which will help you understand what kinds of products a specific kind of customer is most attracted to. If you have a website, Google Analytics can tell you a lot about the people who are currently visiting your site. Many social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, also have \\"insights\\" or \\"analytics\\" that provide information about demographics and interests. The manufacturer of a product can also likely provide customer demographics. If you don't have an established store or website, you can find out a lot about your potential customers by researching your competitors. Even if you do have your own store or website, you should still consider doing this research because it will show you if a certain competitor has been more successful at attracting a specific type of customer than you have. You can learn some basic information about your competitors' customers by looking at their social media accounts and viewing the profiles and/or comments of people who follow them. Some will even show you the most common age group of followers. If your competitor has a store, spend some time there and try to assess the kinds of customers who shop there. There is a ton of market research that has already been done and that can be very helpful to your business. Try searching online for market research, target markets, or customer profiles in your specific industry. The data might not be exactly what you would have collected if you had done it yourself, but it will provide useful insights nonetheless. Trade publications might also be a good source of information. If you've already done a ton of online research and observed your current customers, you may feel like you need some input from real people. It is possible to conduct this kind of research on your own, although you might want to consider hiring a professional firm if you are unsure about how to recruit good participants or interpret the data. Ask customer existing customers to complete surveys, either online or at your store. You can include questions about their demographics and interests, about the their perceptions of your product, and about what services or products they would like you to offer. If you want to get more responses to your survey, you can try paid online surveys. There are a variety of companies, including Swagbucks and Vindale Research, that will post your surveys online for a fee. You can also try conducting focus groups if you want to get more detailed information about how a specific group of people feels about your product or service. Once you have answered the questions about your business and conducted your market research, you can finish compiling a complete profile of your ideal customer. If you have multiple products or services, you may have a different ideal customer for each. Your profile should include a combination of demographic information, which will help you understand the socioeconomic status of your customers, and psychographic information, which provides insights into the personalities of your customers. Important demographic information may include age, racial/ethnic background, gender, marital status, education level, occupation, income, number of children, and location. Important psychographic information may include hobbies, interests, beliefs, religion, lifestyle, and technology preferences.

It's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two. Lemmon had already been in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon). That particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this goes by at a brisk hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau's apartment is a tad long (so was this sentence). That's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time. I have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and I won't go deeper into that. The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of American movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a \\"Well, I never...\\" out of the most prudish person out there. It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just doesn't fit them. Of course, now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this. I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So there you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and films ever. Add: I have just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry.

If the sentence is intended to inquire about the person Bill left behind in a specific situation or relationship, a more accurate version would be, \\"Whom did Bill leave behind?\\" Alternatively, if the context is related to Bill bequeathing property or possessions, the corrected sentence could be, \\"To whom did Bill leave his belongings?\\" By revising the sentence according to the intended meaning, it not only becomes a grammatically correct English sentence, but it also conveys a clearer idea of the desired information."},{"instruction":"OK , here 's what happened .

Step 2: Identify the key event The key event in this scenario is the call received from the sister ship, which informed them about the orcas' presence. Step 3: Assess the possible outcome without the key event Now, we need to imagine the situation if they hadn't gotten the call from the sister ship. In this case, the group would be unaware of the presence of orcas nearby. Step 4: Determine the implications of the alternative outcome Without the knowledge of the orcas, the group would continue their excursion tour as planned, with lower expectations of seeing orcas, but anticipating sightings of humpback whales.

Much like their previous game, the Chiefs began with a weak showing offensively before getting a lot of use out of their rookie wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, and a touchdown catch by Tony Gonzalez (his record-tying 62nd). The TD by Gonzalez tied him with Shannon Sharpe for the most touchdown receptions by a tight end. After another TD catch by Bowe, cornerback Tyron Brackenridge ran back a fumble by San Diego to effectively win the game for Kansas City. Late into the fourth quarter, fans at Qualcomm Stadium voiced their displeasure with Turner by chanting \\"Marty! Marty! Marty!\\" in reference to former coach Marty Schottenheimer who was fired by the Chargers after their 2006 season. The win put the Chiefs 2-2 and tied them with the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders for first place in the AFC West. The win was also the 50th win in Herman Edwards' coaching career.

To analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, we can break it down into specific components and examine the evidence for each: 1. The method involves using alpine calf's fat tissue: The premise clearly states that the treatment involves the use of synthetically generated alpine calf's fat tissue. This suggests that the treatment, at least in part, is designed for wounds sustained by calves - as opposed to wounds sustained by other animals or humans. However, it is important to note that the source of the tissue could also simply be a factor in its effectiveness rather than directly indicating the target organism for the treatment. 2. The treatment is intended for wounds: The premise explicitly mentions that the method is applied to a \\"wound,\\" which aligns with the hypothesis that it is a treatment for a specific type of injury. 3. The wound was sustained in a farmyard: The hypothesis refers explicitly to a wound sustained in a farmyard, but the premise does not provide any information about the location or environment where the wound occurred. Consequently, we cannot directly connect the premise to this specific aspect of the hypothesis. 4. The wound was sustained by a calf: The premise does not specify whether the wound was sustained by a calf (as the hypothesis does) or another organism. Mention of calf's fat tissue may suggest specificity for calves, but this is not directly stated. It could be possible that the treatment works for a variety of organisms and not just calves. In conclusion, while the premise does provide some support for the hypothesis that the method was primarily designed for treating calf's wounds sustained in a farmyard, it does not completely entail the hypothesis. Further information about the location of the wound and whether the treatment was specifically intended for calves would be needed to determine if the premise indeed fully supports the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Problem:In many applications, ideas that are described by a set of words often flow between different groups. To facilitate users in analyzing the flow, we present a method to model the flow behaviors that aims at identifying the lead-lag relationships between word clusters of different user groups. In particular, an improved Bayesian conditional cointegration based on dynamic time warping is employed to learn links between words in different groups. A tensor-based technique is developed to cluster these linked words into different clusters (ideas) and track the flow of ideas. The main feature of the tensor representation is that we introduce two additional dimensions to represent both time and lead-lag relationships. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method is more effective than methods based on traditional clustering techniques and achieves better accuracy. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of our method in helping users understand the flow of ideas between different user groups on social media.

Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Philip Arnold Heseltine spent a year in Ireland to study Celtic culture and language, which had a positive and lasting influence on his work."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Upon reaching an appropriate age (usually between 18 and 21 years), children are encouraged, but not forced, to \\"leave the nest\\" and begin an independent life. After children leave home, they often find social relationship and financial support outside the family. Parents do not arrange marriages for their children, nor do children usually ask permission of their parents to get married. Romantic love is most often the basis for marriage in the United States; young adults meet their future spouses through other friends, at jobs, and in organizations and religious institutions. Although children choose their own spouses, they still hope their parents will approve of their choices. In many families, parents feel that children should make major life decisions by themselves. A parent may try to influence a child to follow a particular profession but the child is free to choose another career. Sometimes children do exactly the opposite of what their parents wish in order to be independent. A son may decide not to go into his father's business on purpose because of a fear that he will lose his autonomy in his father's workplace. This independence from parents is not an indication that parents and children do not love each other. Strong love between parents and children is universal and this is no exception in the American family. Coexisting with such love in the American family are cultural values of self-reliance and independence.

While some preliminary studies have demonstrated potential benefits of cannabinoids, the active compounds found in cannabis, in treating certain symptoms and side effects of cancer and cancer treatments, these findings should not be interpreted as a definitive cure. Most of the research has focused on alleviating pain, nausea, and vomiting associated with cancer treatments rather than the disease itself. In laboratory settings, some studies have indicated that cannabinoids may have anti-cancer effects. However, these findings have not consistently translated to human clinical trials. Moreover, there is a lack of large-scale, well-conducted clinical trials to support claims that cannabis oil cures cancer. It is worth noting that some sellers may intentionally or unintentionally exaggerate the potential benefits of cannabis oil to promote their products or misconstrue the existing research. These claims may be driven by financial gain or based on a genuine belief in the product's curative properties. In any case, it is crucial for anyone considering using cannabis products, including cannabis oil, to consult a healthcare professional and rely on peer-reviewed scientific research rather than anecdotal evidence or marketing claims. Question 2: Does cannabis oil made from Indica plant really cure cancer? The answer to this question follows the same principles as the first question. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that cannabis oil derived specifically from the Indica plant, or any other variant of cannabis, can cure cancer. While some studies have investigated the potential therapeutic properties of individual cannabinoids or extracts from cannabis plants (e.g., THC, CBD), the efficacy of cannabis oil as a cancer cure remains inconclusive. It is important to approach such claims with skepticism and caution, regardless of the specific cannabis plant source. As with the claims surrounding cannabis oil in general, it is essential to rely on well-conducted, peer-reviewed scientific studies and the guidance of healthcare professionals when evaluating the potential benefits or risks associated with using products derived from the Indica plant or any other cannabis plant. In conclusion, the answer to both questions is A). No. Based on current scientific evidence, it is not accurate to claim that cannabis oil, whether derived from the Indica plant or otherwise, can cure cancer. While promising research suggests cannabinoids may have potential therapeutic value in treating specific symptoms and side effects associated with cancer and cancer treatments, it is crucial to distinguish this from a definitive cure for the disease. Individuals considering using cannabis products for cancer-related issues should always consult with their healthcare providers and be cautious of sellers' claims that may not be supported by rigorous scientific research."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was more than 355.

He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The two song cycles that Saint-Saëns wrote during his career are Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré)."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"What was created prior to 1950?\\" Context: \\"After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is a great source of confusion in the fact that the ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire. This was officially changed to Hampshire in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a non-metropolitan district in 1974.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Before 1950, several key historical events and innovations took place, some of which are linked to the context provided. To focus on the region in question, the area now known as Southampton and its broader county of Hampshire have experienced significant changes over time. The historical trajectory began even before the formation of the Hampshire County Council in 1888. To provide a comprehensive view of what transpired before 1950, we must first look into the early history of Southampton and Hampshire. Then, we can analyze the broader societal, technological, and political developments that occurred during this time. 1. Early history of Southampton and Hampshire: Pre-dating the County Council formation, Southampton has a rich history dating back to the Roman and Saxon eras. The Romans built a settlement known as Clausentum in the area, which later became known as Hamwic or Hamtun by the Saxons. In medieval times, Southampton thrived as a crucial port for trade and travel. By the Tudor period, Southampton had already established itself as a bustling city with a growing population and its city walls. 2. Establishment of Hampshire County Council in 1888: As stated in the context given, after the Local Government Act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the newly established Hampshire County Council. This act led to shared governance between the Southampton Corporation and the county council. The ancient shire county was also known as the County of Southampton or Southamptonshire during this time. 3. Rise of the industrial era: During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United Kingdom, including Southampton and the broader Hampshire region, experienced an industrial revolution. This period saw rapid advancements in technology, manufacturing, and infrastructure. Significant innovations, such as steam-powered ships and the railway, significantly impacted Southampton's growth. Moreover, the city's shipping and port industries flourished, with Southampton becoming a significant hub for ocean liner travel, including the Titanic in 1912. 4. World War I and World War II: Between 1914-1918 and 1939-1945, the World Wars impacted all of Europe, including the United Kingdom. Southampton and the broader region played essential roles in these global conflicts. Hampshire was particularly crucial in the preparations for the D-Day landings during World War II, given its strategic location on the south coast. 5. Changing designations and post-war developments: In 1950, Southamptonshire was officially renamed Hampshire. This change aimed to lessen confusion and streamline the nomenclature of the county. Following World War II, both Southampton and the broader Hampshire region underwent significant reconstruction and development. This period saw a shift towards modernizing the city's infrastructure. Before 1950, Southampton had experienced several pivotal historical events and transformations, ranging from its early Roman and Saxon settlements to the industrial revolution and the World Wars. The establishment of Hampshire County Council in 1888 was a vital moment in the area's governance, paving the way for shared administration and the eventual reshaping of the region's identity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Fine Hair gets thicker!

Mature trees producing seeds through the process of sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation. In order to better understand this step, let's explore it in more detail: First of all, the process of seed production is crucial for the sustenance and continuity of plant populations in a forest. Trees can reproduce through two primary methods: sexual reproduction and vegetative propagation. The missing first step in the mentioned process focuses on sexual reproduction, which involves the production of seeds. However, it is essential to acknowledge that vegetative propagation also plays a significant role in the reproduction of trees, especially in some species. Sexual reproduction in trees begins with the production of flowers. Flowers typically contain both male and female reproductive organs, although, in some species, flowers are only male or female. The male part of the flower, called the stamen, produces pollen, which contains the genetic material (male gamete) required for fertilization. The female part of the flower, called the pistil, contains the ovary, which houses the ovules, the female gametes. Trees reproduce sexually through the process of pollination, which can also occur through wind, animals, insects, or water. Pollination transports pollen from the male reproductive organ (in the anther) to the female reproductive organ (in the stigma). This process allows male gametes to meet the female gametes within the ovary of the flower. Following successful pollination and fertilization, seeds are produced within the ovary as the fertilized ovules develop. The process of seed production varies between tree species and the environmental factors surrounding them. Trees may produce seeds annually, biennially, or sporadically. Once the seeds are mature, they develop unique characteristics to aid in dispersal, such as wings in the case of maple trees or the pappus of dandelion seeds. With the production of seeds as the missing first step in the given process, the subsequent steps can be better understood within the context of a tree's life cycle: 1. Mature trees producing seeds through the process of sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation. 2. The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc. 3. The seeds reach the ground. 4. Grow into new trees. 5. These new trees produce seeds. 6. The process repeats itself over and over. In conclusion, mature trees producing seeds through sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation is the missing first step in the provided process. This step is vital, as it initiates the life cycle of a tree, leading to the continuation of forest ecosystems and the propagation of tree species."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

The bio was more popular with the masses than the fiction book. The Choose your answer from: (A). bio must be written more cogently.; (B). fiction book must be written more cogently.;","output":"The bio was more popular with the masses than the fiction book. The most plausible explanation for this observed trend can be attributed to several factors that contributed to the bio's success and perhaps to some shortcomings in the execution of the fiction book. Both the bio and fiction book catered to different audiences and served different purposes, and a comparative analysis of the factors playing a crucial role in their popularity can shed light on the reasons behind this disparity. Firstly, the bio must have been written more cogently. In other words, the author succeeded in writing a clear, compelling, and well-structured narrative that captured the readers' attention and maintained their interest throughout the book. By presenting the life story of a prominent individual in an engaging manner, the author was able to connect with the readers on an emotional level, which played a pivotal role in the book's success. Furthermore, this cogent writing style had the added advantage of being easily accessible to a wider audience, as the language and tone were not overly complex or academic. On the other hand, the fiction book might not have been written as cogently. This could have led to a less engaging experience for the readers, making it difficult for them to become immersed in the story and the characters' journeys, thus leading to a less favorable reception. To be written more cogently, the fiction book would need to focus on improving its narrative structure, character development, and pacing, ensuring that the story flows smoothly and effectively captures the readers' imagination. Readers need to feel invested in the plot and characters to truly appreciate a work of fiction, and a highly cogent writing style can facilitate this emotional connection. In addition to the cogency of their writing, other factors may have contributed to the bio's popularity as well. For instance, public interest in the subject matter of the bio may have been higher than that of the fiction book. Given that a biography typically explores the life and achievements of a well-known figure, readers might have been inherently more curious about the biographical subject, resulting in greater demand for the book. Moreover, the successful marketing of the bio, such as through positive reviews and word-of-mouth endorsements, would have also played a role in its popularity. While it is clear that the bio benefits from being written more cogently, other factors must not be overlooked in explaining its popularity among the masses as compared to the fiction book. However, it is also essential for authors of both biographies and fiction books to remain cognizant of the importance of writing in a clear, engaging, and meaningful manner, ensuring that their work resonates with readers and stands the test of time. A cogent writing style, coupled with compelling content or gripping storytelling, has the power to capture the audience's imagination and can largely influence the success of any literary work."},{"instruction":"Q:Q: A lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of what?

And that could be a problem. Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that. They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part. The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting. Surprisingly, even though the students remembered less of what they read while texting, most of them answered questions in messages perfectly. \\"Our teachers are very happy to see these results,\\" says Coler. The teens' new data strongly support their teachers' opinion that texting while studying is a serious distraction. From the results of the experiment, we can find _ .

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The statement you provided translates from German to English as: \\"Aren't we promoting undeclared work by applying such a transition period in Romania and Bulgaria?\\" To answer your question, it is important to first clarify what the transition period in question is referring to. Given that Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union (EU) in 2007, one potential meaning could refer to labor market restrictions that were placed upon citizens of these countries within other EU nations. These restrictions were placed with the aim of gradually integrating the workforce of new members into the common labor market, consequently reducing potential economic shocks. While it is plausible to argue that such restrictions could indirectly encourage undeclared work or \\"Schwarzarbeit\\", it's important to understand the full breadth of factors at play. 1. **Demand and Supply:** If there is an adequate demand for work and a ready supply of workers willing to perform the job, but legal pathways are restrictive or non-existent, it is inevitable that some level of illegal work might take place. 2. **Economic Conditions:** The economic situation in Romania and Bulgaria relative to Western European countries could make illegal work more attractive. If job opportunities are scarce or wages are significantly lower in home countries, undeclared work elsewhere might be seen as a viable solution. 3. **Legal Barriers:** The complex, time-consuming nature of some legal labor migration processes may encourage some individuals to pursue illegal work, which often has fewer immediate obstacles. 4. **Lack of Awareness and Exploitation:** Many people may not be fully aware of their rights or the legal procedures involved in acquiring work. This can leave them vulnerable to exploitation and push them into the informal labor market. However, it's important to note that while some may take advantage of these situations, many others abide by the rules and respect the transition period designed to help economies adjust to new market realities following European Union enlargement. Moreover, the European Union has implemented measures to combat undeclared work, including the founding of the European Platform tackling undeclared work. This body stimulates cooperation at EU level, sharing information and best practices to prevent and deter undeclared work. Therefore, while the transition period may indirectly create an environment in which undeclared work can thrive, it's part of a much larger, more complex issue. Factors such as socio-economic disparities, legal obstacles, and individual choices also significantly contribute to the occurrence of Schwarzarbeit. The EU's challenge lies in creating functional, effective policies that can address these intricate dynamics."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link.\\" answer the question \\"What is another name for videophone calls?\\"","output":"Yes, it does answer the question.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low.

Explanation: - The premise describes a man in blue jumping a dirt bike, which implies that the man is riding a dirt bike and performing a jump. - The hypothesis suggests that the man in blue falls off a tricycle. This statement is significantly different from the premise since it involves a tricycle instead of a dirt bike and mentions the man falling off it, which does not occur in the premise.

He examined it and said, \\"The regulator must be pushed up as your watch is four minutes slow. I tried to stop him from doing so, but he didn't listen and pushed the regulator. My beautiful watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. By the end of the second month it had left all the clocks and watches of the town far behind. I could do nothing but take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch at once, but he asked me to come in a week's time. When at last I got my watch back from him, it began to slow down. And I failed to be in time for trains, business affairs, and even missed my dinners. Now I went to a third watchmaker. When I was waiting for him to repair my poor watch, he took it to pieces and said that he would try to finish this work in three or four days. What I could do was to nod my head. After that, my watch went for half a day, and then stopped. So I kept taking my watch from one watchmaker to another. But each watchmaker disappointed me.

Naturally there arethose who can appreciate this cd based solely on its pianistic values, but one is forced to listen to the music by trying to forget that it is 'Radiohead' music. Sort of like playing a Bartok piano work in the style of Chopin: It might sound fine asChopin, but not as Bartok. Radiohead's music works as a total sound, sensibility and lyrical package, not simply as melodies alone. Answer:","output":"Based on the customer's review, I would say that he is dissatisfied with the product. The primary reason for this conclusion is that the reviewer emphasizes the absence of a critical aspect, which they refer to as \\"sensibility\\" in the music recorded by O'Riley. This aspect, they imply, is fundamental to the enjoyment and appreciation of Radiohead's original work, and as such, the product does not meet their expectations. The reviewer acknowledges that there are individuals who can appreciate the CD due to its pianistic values, but they struggle to do so themselves. Their explanation revolves around the notion that they need to forget this is Radiohead's music to try and enjoy it. They further illustrate this point using the analogy of playing a Bartok piano piece in Chopin's style, stating that it might sound good as Chopin's music, but not as Bartok's. The reviewer ultimately concludes that Radiohead's music is best appreciated as a \\"total sound, sensibility, and lyrical package\\" rather than just melodies. This indicates that the product failed to capture the essence of the original music, leading to their dissatisfaction.

Step 2: Compare the premise to the hypothesis - The premise focuses on the independent existence of Hickman and Sunraider as characters in Ellison's writings and their presentation through various disconnected pieces. - The hypothesis specifically focuses on the idea that these characters led lives as secret agents, based on hints within the writing. Step 3: Evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis - The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as it only establishes that Hickman and Sunraider have an independent existence and are featured in various, unconnected pieces by Ellison. It does not directly suggest anything about the characters living lives as secret agents.

Her stepfather was a steelworker, and she has a sister who would become a biology teacher. She began piano lessons at age seven. A childhood bicycle mishap resulted in her noticing a mailbox of a man named Macy Gray; she used the name in stories she wrote and later decided to use it as her stage name. While attending the University of Southern California, she agreed to write songs for a friend. A demo session was scheduled for the songs to be recorded by another singer, but the vocalist failed to appear, so Gray recorded them herself. I started forming bands and writing songs just for fun and then I really got into it and got attached to it. Then a friend of mine asked me to be a singer in his jazz band. He gave me all these jazz CDs and I studied all these different singers and I kind of taught myself how to sing for a gig, but I didn't take it seriously until later. She then met writer-producer Joe Solo while working as a cashier in Beverly Hills. Together, they wrote a collection of songs and recorded them in Solo's studio. The demo tape gave Gray the opportunity to sing at jazz cafes in Los Angeles. Although Gray did not consider her unusual voice desirable for singing, Atlantic Records signed her. She began recording her debut record but was dropped from the label upon the departure of A&R man Tom Carolan, who had signed her to the label. Macy returned to Ohio but in 1997 Los Angeles based Zomba Publishing Senior VP A&R man Jeff Blue, convinced her to return to music and signed her to a development deal, recording new songs based on her life experiences, with a new sound, and began shopping her to record labels.

Question: suppose owls leave their nests less happens, how will it affect HELPING owls to hunt at night. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If owls leave their nests less frequently, it will result in several consequences that could affect their ability to hunt at night. The overall effect on their hunting abilities will be determined by the interaction of these consequences. To understand these factors, we need to consider the different aspects of an owl's hunting behavior and the circumstances under which the owl is hunting. Firstly, the fact that owls are not leaving their nests as often might cause them to hunt less efficiently. Owls rely on their keen eyesight and sensitive hearing to locate and catch their prey in the dark. With less time spent outside the nest, the owl has a reduced window of opportunity to hone its predatory skills. Consequently, it will become harder for the owl to maintain its sharp senses and fast reflexes necessary for successful hunting. In this case, the supposed perturbation will result in a lesser effect on the owls' ability to hunt. Secondly, the reduction in the time spent outside the nest will also lead to less exposure to the available prey in the area. Consequently, an owl may not have a clear understanding of the distribution and behavior of its prey, making it more challenging to locate and catch them. The reduced time spent hunting could potentially make the owls less familiar with their hunting territory and limit their knowledge of the best spots to find prey. As a result, this perturbation could have a lessening effect on the owls' ability to hunt at night. However, it is possible to argue that the reduced time outside the nest might not have a significant impact on the owls' ability to hunt. Owls are known to be highly efficient predators, and they can quickly adapt to changes in their environment. For instance, if the owls leave their nests less frequently, they may adapt by hunting more intensively and efficiently during the limited time spent outside. In other words, they could catch the same number of prey in a shorter time, thus compensating for the reduced hunting time. In this scenario, the perturbation would have little to no effect on the owls' hunting abilities. Moreover, other factors, such as changes in prey populations and the availability of food, can also have a significant influence on the owls' hunting success. If there is an abundance of prey in the area, the owls may not need to leave their nests as often because they can catch enough food in a shorter time. Similarly, if there is a scarcity of prey, the owls may have to work harder to find food regardless of the duration of their hunting expeditions. Therefore, the effect of the supposed perturbation on the owls' ability to hunt will also depend on the specific environmental conditions they are experiencing. In conclusion, it is difficult to definitively ascertain the impact of owls leaving their nests less frequently on their ability to hunt at night without considering the various factors influencing their hunting behavior. Depending on factors such as individual hunting skills, prey distribution and abundance, and the owls' ability to adapt to new circumstances, the supposed perturbation could have more, less, or no effect on their ability to hunt at night."},{"instruction":"Warwick Todd is a fictional character created by author and comedian Tom Gleisner.

Jessica asked Natalie to clean and bandage their wound from being shot because","output":"Jessica's hands were too shaky from the adrenaline of the recent events. Step 1: Assess the wound The first thing Natalie did was to calm herself down and assess the wound to determine the severity and the best course of action. She needed to understand how bad the wound was and if there was any immediate life-threatening danger. Step 2: Prioritize safety Natalie then made sure they were both in a safe location, away from any danger that could worsen their condition or impede her in helping Jessica. She also ensured they had easy access to an escape route, in case they needed to leave hastily. Step 3: Gather necessary supplies Once confident about their safety, Natalie grabbed a first aid kit and collected the necessary supplies. This included sterile gauze, antiseptic, band-aids, adhesive tape, and a pair of clean scissors. Step 4: Clean the wound Natalie put on a pair of disposable gloves to maintain cleanliness and protect both herself and Jessica from infection. She then used the antiseptic to gently clean the area around the gunshot wound, making sure to remove any debris or dirt that could cause further harm. Step 5: Apply pressure to stop bleeding As the wound began to bleed, Natalie applied firm, steady pressure directly onto the wound with a sterile gauze pad. She held the pressure until the bleeding started to slow down and become more manageable. In case the bleeding wouldn't stop, Natalie was prepared to call for professional medical assistance. Step 6: Dress and bandage the wound Once the bleeding was under control, Natalie placed a fresh sterile gauze pad over the gunshot wound and secured it with adhesive tape. She made sure not to apply the tape directly on the wound, but rather on the gauze surrounding it. She then gently wrapped a clean bandage around the affected area to hold the gauze in place and provide additional support. Step 7: Continuously monitor the patient After bandaging the wound, Natalie stayed by Jessica's side to monitor her condition. She checked for any signs of infection or worsening symptoms such as fever, increased pain, or redness and swelling around the wound. Natalie knew that seeing a doctor as soon as possible was crucial, so she helped Jessica to organize transportation to the nearest medical facility. Throughout the whole process, Natalie made sure to remain as calm and reassuring as possible, all while keeping in mind Jessica's need for immediate medical attention. With the wound cleaned and bandaged, they could now focus on getting professional help to ensure a speedy recovery."},{"instruction":"One year in the job as the Chinese Communist Party supremo, Xi Jinping so far has presided over a relatively smooth transition of leadership. But what is his vision for the next 10 years, when he is expected to serve as paramount leader? No one has a crystal ball that gives definitive clues. In the first few months since he took power, Xi has pushed a popular and arguably progressive agenda: attacking corruption, not just flies (junior officials) but a few tigers (senior officials) too; curbing official extravagance, like senseless banqueting, and, one of my favorites, banning \\"empty speeches.\\" But in recent weeks, Xi has turned \\"left\\". He allowed tighter control over the traditional and social media, silenced dissenting voices among academics and scholars, and cracked down on liberal activists, petitioners and protesters. At the same time, Xi has paid homage to Chairman Mao Zedong and some of his preaching. He visited a few revolutionary shrines, endorsed the Maoist practices of \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" -- ostensibly to purify the party ranks -- and advocated \\"mass line\\" campaigns to improve the party's popularity among the people. Analysts wonder: Is Xi a Maoist or a Dengist? Is he a conservative or a reformist? Clearly, Xi is not a Chairman Mao nor a Deng Xiaoping. Like his two predecessors -- Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- Xi is not a legendary revolutionary figure who can command absolute loyalty. In the current political system, he is merely a primus inter pares -- first among equals, who leads by consensus. Left or right? Like Deng, Xi may not have to seek absolute dominance, a la Mao, to be an effective leader. Instead, he may just seek to find the center of the debate. Still, unless and until there is fundamental political reform, China will remain a nation more dependent on the power of a single leader, a charismatic strongman, than on institutions. Friends in China asked me these same questions, and my honest answer is: no one knows for sure, but I think Xi is signaling \\"left\\" so he can turn \\"right\\". Expectations of Xi were high on the eve of the Third Plenum of the Communist Party's central committee, China's 300-plus political elite, who last week met behind closed doors in Beijing. Sinologists had drawn parallels to the Third Plenum in 1978, a landmark meeting that launched Deng Xiaoping's reform and open-door program. Chinese media accounts on documents approved during the plenum signal significant changes:. Prickly issues. China's top leaders have been deliberating these prickly issues for years, but decisions have been put off for lack of consensus or political will. That Xi was able to push these through this time, analysts say, indicates Xi's growing influence. The Plenum has also agreed to set up two new institutions: the Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Economic Reform and the National Security Commission. The security commission will be a supra-ministerial body that will take charge of over-arching security issues, including military and police matters, territorial disputes, cyber-attacks and ethnic unrest. Xi is expected to play a leading role in the two groups, even though Premier Li Keqiang may head the economic reform commission. These institutions, analysts say, will allow Xi and his team to supervise the complex and often conflicting bureaucracies -- the Communist Party, the government, the military and police in a top-down authoritarian way. Proponents of reform sound optimistic. Endorsements. The plenum gives market forces a \\"decisive role\\" that will allow enterprises and individuals to invest more overseas, economist Wang Zhile, an expert on international business and trade told me. The most significant endorsement came from Wu Jinglian, the octogenarian guru of the Deng's reform program who also served as doctoral degree adviser of Premier Li Keqiang at Peking University. Speaking in Beijing this week, Wu said the system set up by China in 1978 when China embarked on reform and opening was \\"the initial primary-stage version of market economy for the late 21st century, which still took on many vestiges of the old system.\\" The one put forth by Xi, he said, is \\"an upgraded version for a more mature market economy system that suits the current demands.\\" But analysts also caution against excessive optimism. It will take longer than expected to make these reforms work, says economist Cheng Siwei, using the Chinese maxim \\"Bu pa man, zhi pa zhan\\" -- slowing down is not worrisome; a standstill is. Three decades ago, the late Communist leader Chen Yun, a contemporary of Deng Xiaoping, likened the Chinese economy to a bird and the Chinese political system to a bird cage. While the cage may be enlarged to let the bird fly more freely, Chen argued, it must never be discarded. Xi and his cohorts seem to agree on that.

His new friends kept telling him to try fish and chips. Thus, Harry decided to go to the market to get fish and chips. Harry loved the fish and chips! Write the next sentence.","output":"After devouring his meal, Harry couldn't help but agree with his friends - the golden, crispy batter enveloping the tender fish, together with the warmly comforting salted chips, were indeed a delightful gastronomic experience unique to England. Devouring his second serving of fish and chips, he felt a sudden wave of appreciation for the UK’s national dish. The delicate whiteness of the fish, enveloped in a cocoon of satisfyingly crispy batter, was perfectly complimented by the thick-cut chips. Each mouthful introduced new textures and flavors: the initial crunch of batter leading to the soft, flaky fish; the rough, rustic feel of the chips with their fluffy insides; the sharp tang of vinegar cutting through the richness of the dish. And as he ate, he could taste a hint of the sea - a subtle reminder of the fish's origins. And then there were the chips. Like the fish, they were golden and crispy on the outside, yet inside lurked warm, comforting fluffiness. The salt on the chips added an extra hint of flavor – a little goes a long way. When put together, the fish and chips truly sang a harmonious song that led to an irresistible medley of taste sensations. When Harry bit into both at the same time, the combination was truly spectacular, as the contrasting flavors and textures played wonderfully off one another. While still munching on his last piece of fish, he thought of how perfectly balanced the dish was. The crispiness of the outer layers perfectly compensated for the softer textures inside. The slightly greasy, yet undeniably delicious morsels were exactly what he needed to shake off the chill of the English weather. It was a filling and hearty, yet effortlessly simple dish. There was something remarkably comforting about the fish and chips that Harry now understood. It’s not just about the taste, but it also holds a sense of nostalgia, history, and tradition. He could see now why it was cherished by millions across the country. Even the act of eating it from a newspaper with your fingers somehow adds to the charm and experience. In the end, Harry could only describe the entire experience of eating his first traditional English fish and chips as delectably delightful, so much so that it quickly became his favorite meal. It was then he realized that his friends hadn't just introduced him to a local delicacy, they had initiated him into a quintessentially British tradition. It was a fitting welcome to his new life in England.

It would have to be either a man or a woman. A: no","output":"What requires to choose between a man and a woman, but neither is a correct choice?"},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same? Why do we live if we are going to die? According to the theory of evolution, why do we die?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same, as they are asking about different aspects of life and death. Let's dive into each question to better understand their differences. 1. Why do we live if we are going to die? This question is an existential inquiry about the purpose of life in light of the inevitability of death. The question encourages reflection on the meaning of life, considering that every living being will eventually die. This is a deeply philosophical matter, open to various interpretations based on personal beliefs, cultural differences, and diverse worldviews. Answers to this question can stem from multiple philosophical, religious, or spiritual perspectives. For instance, some people argue that life is meant to be experienced and enjoyed, embracing both its triumphs and challenges. Others believe that life has a higher purpose, where we must fulfill certain responsibilities, moral codes, or spiritual aspirations. Ultimately, the meaning or reason behind living, even knowing that death is inevitable, depends on an individual's view about the nature and purpose of life itself. 2. According to the theory of evolution, why do we die? This question examines the phenomenon of death through a scientific lens, specifically referring to the theory of evolution. Evolutionary biologists aim to understand how species have evolved over time and how their traits and behaviors have been influenced by the process of natural selection. In this context, the question addresses why death has emerged as an inherent feature of life from an evolutionary perspective. There are several factors that contribute to death from an evolutionary standpoint: Aging and Senescence: Organisms age and undergo senescence, which is a decline in their physiological functions. This decline is the result of accumulated genetic damage, loss of cellular functionality, and systemic breakdown of the organism. Aging organisms ultimately succumb to death, allowing for younger, healthier, and more capable individuals in the population to survive and reproduce, thus promoting the spread of advantageous genes in the gene pool. Resource Allocation: Death also plays a role in resource allocation in ecosystems. In any given environment, resources like food, water, and habitats are finite. When organisms die, they free up valuable resources for the next generation, ensuring that their offspring can grow, thrive, and contribute to the survival of the species. Selective Pressure: Death is a crucial driver of selective pressure, influencing the process of natural selection. The survival of the fittest principle guides evolution, where organisms with better-adapted traits have a higher chance of survival and reproduction. If organisms did not die, natural selection would slow down and become less efficient. Death enables species to evolve by allowing more beneficial traits to enter the population and disadvantageous traits to be eliminated. Precipitated by Environmental Factors: Organisms in the wild are vulnerable to various environmental factors like predation, diseases, and adverse environmental conditions. These factors contribute to death, which in turn influences the course of evolution by placing selective pressure on certain genes and shaping the traits of species over time. In summary, the two questions differ as the first addresses the existential purpose of life despite the certainty of death, while the second explores the evolutionary basis for the existence of death itself. The first question warrants reflection on an individual's beliefs and worldviews, while the second has a more scientific approach, examining the role of death in nature and the evolutionary process."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Since the existing SMTP connector has a cost of 1, it makes sense to increase this cost to 10 before creating a new outgoing connector. Translation: Given that the current SMTP connector has a cost value of 1, it would be reasonable to consider increasing this cost up to 10 prior to creating a new outgoing connector. This approach allows for a better utilization of resources and perhaps better management of network traffic, as the increased cost may make the existing connector less preferable for the system to use, thus encouraging the system to use the new outgoing connector when needed. When configuring the SMTP connectors, administrators need to keep various factors in mind to ensure smooth and optimized email flow. These factors include cost values, the number and types of connectors, and the factors affecting mail routing. The cost value assigned to each connector determines the preference or priority given to that connector when used for email routing. Lower cost values indicate higher preference, and vice versa. By updating the existing connector's cost to 10, the system will be encouraged to use the new connector if its cost value is lower than 10. This strategy can potentially lead to performance improvements and more efficient use of infrastructure, as it enables load balancing between the existing and new connectors according to their cost values. In turn, this helps with preventing the saturation of a single connector and ensures more balanced resource usage across the network. Moreover, it is essential to regularly monitor and manage the connectors' settings and costs to ensure optimal performance and email delivery. This might include adjusting the cost values based on the observed trends or identifying and addressing any issues causing delays or inefficiencies in the email flow."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Anna Nicole Smith's estate loses claim to Texas oilman's riches [Updated] Texas oilman J. Howard Marshall II never intended to bestow his fortune on his wife Anna Nicole Smith, a federal court ruled Friday, marking another twist in a convoluted inheritance battle that has outlived both Smith and her adversary, Marshall's son and executor E. Pierce Marshall. The decision by a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal recognizes a 2001 jury verdict in a Texas probate court as having determined that Marshall's will was valid and free of illegal coercion by his son. The will left the oilman's 1.6-billion estate to Pierce Marshall. The ruling appears to derail the late actress’ efforts to be recognized as an heir to half of Marshall's estate, which she claimed he had promised to leave her. A topless dancer and Playboy centerfold, Smith met the 89-year-old Marshall at a Houston strip club he frequented, and they were married in 1994. Marshall died 14 months later, leaving behind an irrevocable trust and will that Smith claimed his son had forged or coerced her ailing husband into signing. Smith had prevailed in getting judgments in her favor under bankruptcy proceedings in California, winning a court ruling in 2000 that she was due 450 million from her late husband’s assets, an amount later reduced by a federal district judge to 89 million. Smith died of a prescription medication overdose at a luxury South Florida hotel three years ago. Pierce Marshall preceded her in death in 2006 at age 67 from complications of an infection. Lawyers for the two sides were representing the interests of Smith's now 3-year-old daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead, and Pierce Marshall's widow, Elaine. The 9th Circuit panel ruling said the probate judgment precludes the bankruptcy case, giving precedence to the Texas court's decision that Marshall left everything to his younger son. The earlier case also denied claims to the fortune by J. Howard Marshall III, who had been written out of the oilman's will after business management disagreements. An attorney for Pierce Marshall's widow said they were pleased with the appeals court ruling and hoped the long legal fight is now over. \\"Our position has always been that there was a full and complete trial in probate court in Texas vindicating Pierce Marshall,\\" said Hartford attorney G. Eric Brunstad, who represents Elaine Marshall. \\"That should have been the end of the matter.\\" Kent L. Richland, the Los Angeles attorney who represented Smith’s executor and former partner Howard K. Stern, deemed the 9th Circuit ruling “a fairly startling extension of the law” as it gave precedence to the probate ruling that came after the bankruptcy court decision. Richland said he was exploring the estate’s options to request rehearing by the full 9th Circuit or to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court again, vowing that “we will certainly be pursuing something further.” [Updated at 3:08 p.m.: A previous version of this post said Richland could not immediately be reached for comment.] A legal battle over Dannielynn's paternity also carried on after Smith's death at age 39. Both Stern and Los Angeles photographer Larry Birkhead claimed to have fathered the girl. DNA testing eventually proved Birkhead was her father and he was awarded custody of the child.

Owner Scott Borchetta, who started the label in 2005, is looking for a price in excess of 200 million, sources said. While Borchetta has been building out the label of late — he just signed a new joint venture with Reba McEntire and Cumulus Group — the sale process is being clouded by a number of factors, including the fact that Swift is nearing the end of her contract with the label. The 24-year-old singer has just one album left on her current contract. Plus, Swift’s family owns a piece of the label. Without Swift, the label’s value is likely worth a lot less. Swift, the centerpiece of the Nashville, Tenn., label, has stunned the record industry yet again with first week sales of her latest album, “1989,” forecast to hit 1.2 million units. If those forecasts prove correct, “1989” will be the first platinum album of the year. Sales of the new offering may even top first week sales of her prior album, “Red,” which hit 1.2 million. One of the hottest acts in the music business, Taylor could be the first artist in history to have three albums sell more than 1 million units in their first week. A tireless promoter, Swift appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” and staged a live concert for Yahoo! and iHeartMedia this week to promote the album. The lanky artist does not stream her new music and drew some criticism from Spotify users for its absence this week. With music labels suffering from a drastic decline in iTunes downloads year-to-date, Swift’s performance is dominating music industry headlines as a rare piece of good news. The young singer, who recently moved to an apartment in Tribeca and is fronting a “Welcome to New York” marketing campaign, has moved away from her country roots and could opt to take her business in-house. To keep her, Big Machine may have to pony up an advance of between 10 million and 20 million, some music executives said. Only with Swift back under a long-term contract will Borchetta get his high sale price, the executives said. Big Machine is also nearing the end of its distribution partnership with Universal Music Group. Lucian Grainge’s UMG, naturally, could be a likely buyer of Big Machine, sources said.

By meeting halfway, the brother can save time and resources, considering that he works and lives relatively close to the family. This arrangement is beneficial for the entire family because it ensures that none of them have to travel the entire distance to reach one another. Meeting halfway can also provide other advantages, such as the opportunity to explore a variety of locations, try new foods, participate in different activities, or discover hidden gems that may be situated along the route. It not only reduces the overall traveling time and expenses but also contributes to a more enjoyable and equitable family experience. Furthermore, the concept of meeting halfway can symbolize the importance of compromise, understanding, and cooperation within a family. In this specific case, it represents the brother's willingness to participate in family gatherings and maintain strong relationships with his loved ones. It may also signify a balance of responsibilities and consideration between the brother and the other family members. By mutually deciding to meet halfway, both parties are demonstrating their efforts to reach a common ground, accommodate one another's needs, and create a harmonious and supportive atmosphere.

A French corporal who served with British soldiers in Afghanistan and admitted to eating the tongue and heart of a 90-year-old man had post-traumatic stress disorder, it has been claimed. Jérémy Rimbaud, 26, is said to have admitted breaking into the home of Lépold Pédébidau and using an iron rod to beat him over the head before cutting out parts of his body with a penknife. Cooked meat found on a plate with white beans was confirmed by forensic experts to be human, following the incident in Nouilhan, south-west France, on November 15 in the hamlet of 200 people. Corporal: French soldier Jérémy Rimbaud had been serving in Afghanistan in a tank regiment (file picture) The attack has drawn comparisons to Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film Silence Of The Lambs. The character, played by Anthony Hopkins, ate human organs ‘with some fava beans and a nice Chianti’. The son of Mr Pédébidau was alerted to what had happened by the flames coming from his father’s house nearby - which was set alight by Rimbaud following the attack, according to investigators. Rimbaud - who had been serving abroad in a tank regiment with British and US soldiers - is accused of attacking another man in France by hitting him against a tractor, reported The Daily Telegraph. The soldier allegedly told police he was 'acting on messages in his head' - and is set to face trial next year over charges of murder, violating the integrity of a corpse and attempted murder. Soldier: Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have 'posed no problems during his stint' in Afghanistan from December 2010 to June 2011 (file picture) Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have ‘posed no problems during his stint’ in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 - but has now been moved to a high-security unit for dangerous psychopaths. He left the army just nine days before allegedly committing the attack - and France Bleu Béarn cited a prosecutor as confirming that military doctors had diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD. PTSD is a reaction to a traumatic event where people can see they are in danger, or where they see other people dying or being injured in circumstances out of their control. Many victims of serious accidents, military combat, terrorist attacks, disasters and life-threatening illnesses have been diagnosed with suffering from the condition.

Possible A: teach class, try to get, go to high school, go to class, study book Why is \\"go to high school\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Go to high school\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because: 1. Age factor: At the age of 15, a teenager has typically completed their middle school education and is transitioning from middle to high school. This is a common scenario that aligns with the usual education system in many countries. 2. Plausibility: The other options like \\"teach class\\", \\"try to get\\", \\"go to class\\", and \\"study book\\" are less plausible in the context of the prompt. A 15-year-old is highly unlikely to have the qualifications necessary to teach a class. \\"Try to get\\" appears vague and nonspecific, while \\"go to class\\" and \\"study book\\" seems general actions that students would have already experienced before turning 15. 3. Major milestone: \\"Go to high school\\" represents a significant milestone in a teenager's life, both academically and socially. This milestone often comes with greater independence and responsibility, which is a common experience for individuals around the age of 15. 4.

To comprehend the potential effects, we first need to analyze the factors that influence forest formation and the role of boilers. Forest formation is a complex and dynamic process, involving multiple stages that were briefly outlined in the original statement. The primary factors affecting forest formation include: 1. Seed availability: Seed production and dispersal are vital for the growth and spread of trees and forests. Healthy, mature trees produce seeds that can be dispersed through various means such as wind and animals. 2. Environmental conditions: Climate, soil type, and water availability all play essential roles in determining if and where a seed can germinate and grow into a tree. 3. Competition and interaction: Seeds and young trees compete for resources such as light, water, and nutrients. Biotic interactions with other plants, animals, and microorganisms can support or hinder forest growth. 4. Human activities: Activities such as agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization can directly impact forest formation by altering landscapes, destroying habitats, and affecting the availability of resources for plant growth. Now, let's discuss the role of boilers. Boilers are heating systems commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings to generate steam or hot water. Boilers require energy sources such as natural gas, coal, wood, and oil to function. It is important to note that the type of energy source utilized may impact forest formation in different ways. For instance, boilers utilizing wood as fuel may lead to increased logging activities and deforestation, while those powered by fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and, consequently, climate change. These factors can lead to a variety of effects on forest formation as detailed below: A. More forest formation: If the addition of more boilers led to a shift from non-renewable energy sources such as coal to sustainable fuel sources like biomass derived from forest waste or dedicated energy crops, it could positively impact forest formation by promoting the sustainable use of forests and fostering more responsible land management practices. B. Less forest formation: Conversely, an increase in the number of boilers might result in higher demand for energy sources like wood and thus result in the over-harvesting of trees and deforestation. Additionally, if boilers using fossil fuels contribute to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate climate change, forest ecosystems could be negatively impacted, leading to reduced tree growth, lower seed production, and shifts in species compositions or geographic distributions. C. No effect: Some cases may lead to no significant impact on forest formation. For example, if the number of boilers increases, but they utilize energy sources like solar, wind, or natural gas that have minimal direct impact on forests, this could have negligible effects on forest formation. In conclusion, the effect of adding more boilers on forest formation depends on various factors, including the fuel sources being used and their interaction with the existing ecosystems and human activities. It is essential to consider and balance these factors when adding boilers to ensure that the process positively contributes to forest formation or, at the very least, causes no harm."},{"instruction":"Question: Who destroyes a cake?

They are noted for their high energy live concerts, movie soundtrack contributions, and their mixture of genre, which can be described as including ska, pop, rock, and world music. The band was founded in 1972 as The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, a performance art group. The band was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved success as a composer for film and television. With the move to MCA, the band made two personnel switches: Mike Bacich took over on keyboards from departing member Richard Gibbs, and John Avila replaced Kerry Hatch on bass. Oingo Boingo appeared in a number of soundtracks in the early to mid-1980s, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which features \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\". Their song charting highest on Billboard Hot 100, \\"Weird Science\\", was written for the John Hughes film of the same name, and was later included on their 1985 album Dead Man's Party. Later, the band made an appearance playing their hit \\"Dead Man's Party\\" on stage in the film Back to School. In addition, they appeared in and performed several songs in the quirky 1984 Tom Hanks movie Bachelor Party, including \\"Who Do You Want to Be?\\", \\"Bachelor Party\\" and \\"Something Isn't Right\\". Then, starting with 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Danny Elfman began scoring major films with increasing frequency, including almost all of Tim Burton's films. Oingo Boingo's 1987 album BOI-NGO was released as a follow-up to the popular Dead Man's Party, but its chart performance was considered an underperformance. After this album, Bacich was replaced by new keyboardist Carl Graves. The band's 1988 release Boingo Alive was actually recorded live on a soundstage, with no studio audience; it consisted of a selection of songs from earlier albums, plus two new compositions. The Boingo Alive track \\"Winning Side\\" became a No. 14 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations. In 1990 the band released their seventh studio album, titled Dark at the End of the Tunnel.

Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921.

A small amount, like 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml), will go a long way. If you’re dipping your fingers into your jar of oil, it’s best to wash your hands with soap first so you don’t spread any bacteria into the oil. For the best quality oil, choose organic, virgin coconut oil, which doesn’t have any additives and is 100% natural. Since the coconut oil is solid at first, melt it with your body heat so you can spread it easily on your face. Gently rub the dollop of oil between your palms in circles until the oil becomes liquid. The melting point for coconut oil is 77 °F (25 °C). Don’t rub too vigorously or your hands will soak up all of the oil and you won’t have any left for your face. Use both hands to rub the oil in small circles all over your face. Pay special attention to any areas that are particularly oily or where dirt builds up, like your chin or in the creases next to your nose. The spots on your face that tend to get oilier are usually located in what’s known as the T-zone, which includes your forehead, nose, chin, and the skin around your mouth. Avoid getting any oil in your eyes. If you do, you’ll notice your vision might be blurry for a few minutes, but it will pass. If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test before you apply the oil to your entire face. Put the oil on a small spot, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse it off. If the spot is irritated or itchy, don’t use the coconut oil. Wet a clean cloth with warm water, then wring it out so it’s damp, but not dripping wet. Place it onto your face so it covers all of your skin. You can use hot water from the sink or microwave a damp cloth for 1 minute to warm it up. This opens up your pores so your skin can soak up the oil better. Tilt your head slightly back so the cloth doesn’t slide off. Set a timer or use the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time. Once the 10 minutes are up, remove the cloth from your face and wipe it over your skin in a circular motion. This removes any oil that didn’t soak in, and also presses the remaining oil further into your pores. If your skin still feels a little oily, you can wash your face with a gentle cleanser afterwards. Apply moisturizer after cleansing your face if you really want to lock in the hydration. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to properly use coconut oil on your face for skincare purposes.

He was named as one of the 40 modern - day Leonardos by the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago . Prospect named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals . - The Center for Bits and Atoms was established in 2001 in the MIT Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is currently run by Neil Gershenfeld. This cross-disciplinary center broadly looks at the intersection of information to its physical representation. - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curriculae. A politician, he had served as state senator in New York. He was later appointed as a US diplomat to Germany and Russia, among other responsibilities. - Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis. This is distinct from nanoscale materials. Based on Richard Feynman's vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or \\"molecular manufacturing\\") would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by molecular machine systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies, and the molecular machinery of life with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories. - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807 December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator. - Swarthmore College (locally, or ), is a highly selective, leading private liberal arts college located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, southwest of Philadelphia. - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A quantum Turing machine (QTM), also a universal quantum computer, is an abstract machine used to model the effect of a quantum computer. It provides a very simple model which captures all of the power of quantum computation. Any quantum algorithm can be expressed formally as a particular quantum Turing machine. Such Turing machines were first proposed in a 1985 article written by Oxford University physicist David Deutsch suggesting quantum gates could function in a similar fashion to traditional digital computing binary logic gates. - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - David Elieser Deutsch, FRS (born 18 May 1953), is an Israeli-born British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a Visiting Professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. - Ithaca is a city in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York. It is the seat of Tompkins County, as well as the largest community in the Ithaca-Tompkins County metropolitan area. This area contains the municipalities of the Town of Ithaca, the village of Cayuga Heights, and other towns and villages in Tompkins County. The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake, in Central New York. It is named for the Greek island of Ithaca. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devoted to projects at the convergence of technology, multimedia, sciences, art and design. Staff and students have backgrounds ranging from electrical engineering and computer science to sociology and music and others. The Media Lab has been widely popularized since the 1990s by business and technology publications such as \\"Wired\\" and \\"Red Herring\\" for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. , it has diversified its research into neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments. The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was one of the notable research efforts which grew out of the Media Lab. - Physical Review Letters (PRL), established in 1958, is a peer-reviewed, scientific journal that is published 52 times per year by the American Physical Society. As also confirmed by various measurement standards, which include the \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" impact factor and the journal h-index proposed by Google Scholar, many physicists and other scientists consider \\"Physical Review Letters\\" one of the most prestigious journals in the field of physics. - The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious \\"Physical Review\\" and \\"Physical Review Letters\\", and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian.

Simons on HBO’s “Veep.” Originally from Maine, Simons plays Jonah Ryan on “Veep.” The show returns to HBO for season five on April 24. Favorite show of all time, and why? “The Shield.” Historically, it started the whole notion of television antiheroes, a concept that has now been beaten to death. Seeing it when it first aired, it was nightmarishly fresh. You couldn’t figure out why you were rooting for this terrible person, and every episode made you question yourself and your own morality. There were episodes that would burn in my head, leaving me unable to shake them for weeks. The writing and performances were unbelievable across the board, but Walton Goggins still manages to stand out. I think it also holds the crown for best series finale; it wrapped up satisfyingly without answering every single question for you. Perfectly done. Favorite show right now, and why? There are one million great things on TV right now, including my favorite of the last two years “Togetherness,” which I can’t believe was canceled. “The Americans” is phenomenal, and “Girls” is off the charts good this year (I just always want more Ray in every story line), but “Broad City” has taken my heart as of late. While there are certainly aspects of the show that speak to female friendship that I’ll never know, their portrayal of young, broke, city best-friendship is universal to anyone that has ever been young, broke, and living in a giant city. The episode where Abby is a rapist is one of the funniest things that I’ve seen in recent memory. Favorite bad TV, and why? I stay away from reality television mostly, outside of the occasional episode of “The Voice.” There are just too many good things to watch, and I can’t bring myself to waste time on bad shows. So maybe, “UnReal”? That show is great but it’s gonna be the closest I get to watching trash reality television. I know that makes me sound pretentious, and I’m OK with that. What’s at the top of your Have-To-Watch list? “American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson.” It has rocketed to the top since every single person I know has raved about it. Which show’s world would you want to live inside? My kids have now outgrown it, but I wish they still watched “Curious George” on PBS. I loved that show, and if I had to live in any show, it would be that one. The Man With the Yellow Hat lived the perfect life. He has a job he enjoys, but rarely has to go. He does well, because he owns an apartment in the city and a weekend farm in the country. Super-motivated, he’s always learning how to fly a plane or renovating an old movie theater, and more than anything the guy is unflappable. Nothing ever fazes him. George could buy 1,200 doughnuts by accident or get all the wrong ingredients for the soup for the dinner party, and The Man With the Yellow Hat would be like, “Well let’s just order takeout!” He’s the best of us.

At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue.

General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \\"Boo-ick,\\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \\"Hupp\\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet's experience was similar. Durant brought him into a new car-building venture in 1911, hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver. Chevrolet left the company in 1913, apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles. But its name stuck to the new Chevrolet vehicles; Durant reportedly liked its musical lilt. It could also work the other way around. In 1925, Walter P. Chrysler got the naming rights to the Maxwell Motor Co. after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two-year period. Things turned out a little differently for Henry Ford. He suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name. But his revenge was sweet. The Henry Ford Company, which traded freely on Ford's early fame as an inventor, fired him in 1902 \\"because he was spending all his time developing a race car, not a passenger car,\\" according to the Encyclopedia of American Business and Biography. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers most important new car. After Ford was gone, the company was renamed Cadillac, after Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the French nobleman who founded Detroit in 1703; his heraldry became the model's badge and the company became a part of General Motors in 1909. After his firing, Ford quickly found investors to help him found his own firm, the Ford Motor Co., in 1903. He introduced the company's first new vehicle, the Model and followed it up with other low-cost vehicles, including his greatest achievement, the Model T, in 1908. Its price tag started at 850 and fell steadily as Ford introduced more production innovations. The young firm became phenomenally successful. AOL Autos: 10 classic American rides. In the 1920s, he got the chance to buy the five-year-old Lincoln Motor Co. out of bankruptcy. It was then owned by one of the very people, Henry Leland, who fired him in 1902. Then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the Lincoln name. For its part, General Motors almost didn't get the name it bears today. Durant actually incorporated his company under the name \\"International Motors Co.\\", in New Jersey in 1908. But his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name. \\"We might use 'United Motors Company' were it not for the fact that there is already a United Motor Car Company in that state,\\" the attorney wrote. \\"We suggest the name General Motors Company, as we have ascertained it can be used.\\" A newly coined French word, auto-mobile, inspired many vehicle names of the early years. Inventor Ransom E. Olds filed a patent for an \\"auto-mobile\\" during the mid-1890s. Names like Bugmobile, Locomobile, Hupmobile, and of course, the Oldsmobile, could not have come along without it. The origins of some names can be tricky to trace. The first use of Jeep, for instance. is shrouded in mist. Jim Allen, the author of a book called \\"Jeep,\\" concludes that it's based on early World War II slang for \\"a new, unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle.\\" It wasn't until 1950 that Toledo-based Willys-Overland, Inc., one of the producers of the early four-wheel-drive vehicle, trademarked the term. Many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry. The Toyota name came from the Toyoda loom works in Kariya, Japan; When it turned to car production, the Toyoda family changed the 'd' to a 't' to make it simpler and more elegant in Japanese script. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car names. There's little doubt about other brand names. Pontiac was an offshoot of the Pontiac Buggy Co., a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned Indian chief. Mechanic Soichiro Honda started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of World War II and eventually graduated to cars. AOL Autos: Pontiacs we'll never forget. Volkswagen, a response to Adolf Hitler's call for a car for the common folk, means 'people's car' in German, evidently beating out the prototype's name, 'Strength through Joy,' for the honors. In 1917, the Rapp Engine Works became known as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) as the four-year-old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines, with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo, according to some authorities. The first BMW cars were produced 11 years later. The legendary Jaguar name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time. It beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a British ad agency in 1935. In 1939, Ford struck gold with Mercury, the fleet-footed messenger of the gods. It tapped into Greek and Roman mythology for the name, just as it did for the similarly styled Lincoln Zephyr, the god of the wind, three years earlier. Some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms. Fiat stands for Fabbrica Italiani Automobili Torino, or Italian Automotive Works Turin. Similarly, Saab stands for Svenska Aeroplanaktiebolaget, or Swedish Aeroplane Ltd., hearkening back to the automaker's origins as an aircraft company. Ford might have done better with an acronym in 1958. The Edsel was conceived as a new, distinct Ford Motor Co. brand, with its own models, badge and division. The mission was to take on GM's Oldsmobile. After considering thousands of suggestions, Ford named the new brand after Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's only child. He had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943. The name Edsel was an immediate letdown. Ford stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced. One disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs of all time. Its name wasn't the sole reason for its failure. It didn't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on Ford and Mercury models. But all that didn't stop Edsel from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Many car companies are named after the person who invented them, like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, and Porsche.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? The author believes that: - is bad luck - plucking grey hairs helps easy feelings of being driven crazy by them - not enough information - will make you have bald spots","output":"In summary, the author wanted to bust the beauty myth that plucking grey hairs causes more to grow back in its place. They argue that for years, they plucked their few grey hairs without any increase in number, debunking the myth. Additionally, they point out the lack of logic behind this myth, stating that if it were true, plucking regular hairs would also cause more to grow, which could either cure baldness or create excessively hairy situations after waxing. The author highlights that plucking grey hairs may provide a sense of relief and that there is not enough information to support the myth that plucking leads to an increase in grey hairs or bald spots."},{"instruction":"in seconds, you will learn exactly what type of bsb file you have, the software program associated with your file, the publisher who created it, its security safety status, and a variety of other useful information.

To complete this task, we will need to follow these steps: 1. Identify and gather the set of fruits: In this step, we'll identify the different fruits we're working with, such as apples, oranges, and bananas. We need to have a clear understanding of what each fruit looks like, so we can sort and label them appropriately. 2. Determine the weight of each fruit: Since a key factor for sorting these fruits is their weight, we need to use a weighing device like a scale to accurately measure the weight of each fruit. We must understand how to use the scale and read its output, so that we can accurately compare the weights of the fruits. 3. Create categories or weight ranges: Based on the range of weights obtained in the previous step, we'll create categories or weight ranges to sort the fruits. For example, we could create categories like lightweight, medium weight, and heavyweight. 4. Sort the fruits into the appropriate categories: To do this, we need to know which weight range each fruit belongs in based on their measured weight. We will examine the weighting scale output for each fruit, and then place it in the corresponding category. This step requires understanding of ordinal numbers and classification. 5. Label and store the fruits: Once the fruits have been sorted into their weight categories, label each category for easy identification. This involves knowing proper labeling techniques and the use of language to describe the categories clearly, so that people can understand the sorted fruits. Throughout this task, knowledge of physical objects, such as different types of fruits, a scale, and labeling materials, as well as an understanding of weight and measurement concepts are essential.

A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her... My question: What happened to the samurai's wife at the end of the duel? Answer:","output":"At the end of the duel, as per Tajōmaru's account, the samurai's wife ran away.

In the wife's own account of the story, she mentions that Tajōmaru left after raping her. She then begs her husband to forgive her, but he looks at her coldly. In her version, she frees the samurai and pleads for him to kill her, after which she faints. When she wakes up, she discovers that her husband is already dead, killed by the dagger. Distraught, she attempts to kill herself but fails. Ultimately, \\"Rashomon\\" leaves the viewers to form their own interpretation of the events at the end of the movie, including the fate of the samurai's wife.

It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham. - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim. - Macarius IV Tawil ( or Taouil ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1813 to 1815 . - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. - The Holy See is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.

He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","output":"Patient A would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C. This is because Patient A has Klinefelter's syndrome, which is a genetic condition wherein a male is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY instead of the normal XY). This extra X chromosome causes an imbalance in the body's hormone production, leading to a decrease in testosterone levels. Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone responsible for various male characteristics, and lower levels of this hormone usually result in symptoms associated with Klinefelter's syndrome. On the other hand, Patient C is a male without any mentioned genetic conditions, indicating that he likely has typical XY chromosomes and normal testosterone levels."},{"instruction":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting. Question: Which is not stated in the passage? _ .

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture. Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it? Answer:","output":"The Western land had fewer wetland plants growing on it. Step 1: Identify the characteristics of the lands. - Eastern land: covered in wetlands - Western land: rich soil, good for agriculture Step 2: Relate the characteristics to the presence or absence of wetland plants. - Wetland plants are commonly found in hypoxic soils, which are prevalent in wetland areas. - The Eastern land is covered in wetlands, suggesting it is more likely to have wetland plants. - The Western land has rich soil and is good for agriculture, which implies it is less likely to have wetland plants since agricultural lands typically have well-aerated and non-hypoxic soils. Conclusion: Based on the characteristics of the two lands, the Western land with rich soil suitable for agriculture is likely to have fewer wetland plants growing on it than the Eastern land, which is covered in wetlands."},{"instruction":"Sentence: \\"Cynthia munched at peaches.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"Step 1: Examine the sentence structure.

The verb \\"munched\\" is used correctly to describe the action of eating. However, the preposition \\"at\\" seems to be misplaced. Typically, we would use \\"on\\" to convey the meaning of eating something. So, the corrected sentence would be: \\"Cynthia munched on peaches.\\" Step 3: Determine if the sentence is natural and clear in meaning. Now that the sentence is updated, it reads as a natural and straightforward statement of a person eating peaches.

It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Boba Fett is a fictional character in the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise.

The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas was from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. It was the third and final installment in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy and the first film to use THX technology. The film is set one year after \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and was produced by Howard Kazanjian for Lucasfilm Ltd. The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. - Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, centered on a film series created by George Lucas. It depicts the adventures of various characters \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\". - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Elizabeth Hand (born March 29, 1957) is an American writer. - Jabba Desilijic Tiure, commonly known as Jabba the Hutt (from a Slovak phrase, \\"Žaba a had\\", meaning \\"frog and snake\\") is a fictional character in the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise created by George Lucas. He is depicted as a large, slug-like alien. His appearance has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat. - The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back) is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Boba Fett : Maze of Deception is a 2003 children 's science fiction book by Elizabeth Hand set in the Star Wars galaxy at the beginning of the Clone Wars .

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds.

Many research studies have been conducted in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of these practices as alternative or complementary therapies for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and chronic stress. With the increasing number of individuals turning to such practices for stress relief and general mental well-being, educational institutions, workplaces, and healthcare facilities have started incorporating mindfulness and yoga programs into their routines and offerings. Hypothesis: Introducing regular mindfulness meditation and yoga practice in educational institutions, workplaces, and healthcare facilities can significantly improve mental well-being, alleviate stress, and enhance cognitive performance among participants. To test this hypothesis, a comprehensive study could be designed that evaluates participants' mental health and cognitive performance before and after implementing mindfulness and yoga programs. The study would involve a diverse group of participants, ensuring representation from various age groups, occupations, and backgrounds. The study to test the hypothesis would involve various steps, as mentioned below: 1. Preparing the participants: Recruitment of participants from educational institutions, workplaces, and healthcare facilities, followed by a detailed explanation of the study objectives, the mindfulness meditation, and yoga sessions. 2. Baseline evaluation: Participants would complete standardized self-report questionnaires assessing parameters such as stress levels, depression, anxiety, attention, and cognitive functioning. 3. Intervention: A structured mindfulness meditation and yoga program would be introduced, with sessions held regularly over a period of 8 to 12 weeks, facilitated by certified instructors. 4. Monitoring and support: Throughout the intervention period, participants would receive support and guidance from the instructors, while also tracking their progress, experiences, and adherence to the program. 5. Post-intervention evaluation: After the intervention period, participants would again complete the standardized questionnaires to assess any changes in mental well-being, stress levels, and cognitive performance. 6. Data analysis: The pre- and post-intervention data would be compared using appropriate statistical methods to ascertain whether the mindfulness and yoga program had significant positive effects on the mental well-being and cognitive performance of the participants. 7. Interpretation and conclusion: The final analysis would reveal insights into the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation and yoga for improving mental well-being, alleviating stress, and boosting cognitive performance in various settings. The results could then be used to guide policy changes and further research in the field. If the findings of the study support the hypothesis, it would provide empirical evidence for the benefits of incorporating mindfulness meditation and yoga practices in educational institutions, workplaces, and healthcare settings to promote mental well-being and enhance cognitive performance."},{"instruction":"Sentence: \\"Who did the wealthy young man buy that piano for?\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?

I had heard mixed reviews from my friends, but my love for trying new places despite the potential drawbacks got the better of me. I would like to share my detailed experience to shed some light on the multiple issues I encountered: 1. Reservation and Seating: Despite having reserved a table for 8 PM two days prior, we had to wait for nearly 45 minutes before we were finally seated. The hostess seemed indifferent to our concerns and repeatedly told us that the table \\"would be ready soon,\\" showing a lack of professionalism and respect for our time. 2. Ambience and Cleanliness: While the overall décor was reminiscent of a charming bistro, it was sadly overshadowed by the poor hygiene and cleanliness. The tables were crowded together, making it difficult to have a private conversation, and the noise level was unbearable. Additionally, we noticed crumbs on our table and had to ask the staff to clean it before we sat down. 3. Service: The service was painfully slow and lacking in proper attention to detail. Our drinks arrived after a 20-minute wait, but our server never apologized for the delay. Throughout our meal, we had to constantly remind the staff to refill our water and provide missing cutlery. Moreover, our server appeared uninterested in answering our questions about the menu, making us feel unwelcome and undervalued as customers. 4. Food Quality: The food quality was the biggest letdown. We ordered a mixed platter as our starter, and it arrived looking like a haphazard pile of items, some of which were unidentifiable. The presentation was terrible, and the lack of freshness was evident. Our entrees were no better, with the chicken dish being dry and overcooked, while the pasta was bland and lacking in flavor. The vegetables tasted like they had been boiled for too long, resulting in a mushy texture. To top it all off, the food was served lukewarm, further diminishing our appetite. 5. Price: Although one would expect affordable prices considering the subpar experience, the bill was shockingly expensive. In my opinion, the dishes were severely overpriced for the quality and portions provided. Overall, our experience at the Sunshine Café was profoundly disappointing. The combination of poor service, lack of cleanliness, substandard food quality, and exorbitant prices left us feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. I regret having chosen this establishment for my dinner outing and have no plans to return. I would highly recommend anyone considering this restaurant to look elsewhere, as there is a plethora of better options in the area. It's safe to say that the Sunshine Café failed to live up to even the lowest of expectations."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Lee jumped back into the River after he got his beer. And I was wondering What does Lee need to do before this? Options: --open his beer; --close the lock; --mow the grass; The answer is:","output":"Before Lee jumps back into the River after getting his beer, there are several steps he needs to take to ensure his safety and enjoyment. Although your options highlight three possible actions – opening his beer, closing the lock, and mowing the grass – Lee's priorities should encompass more than just these tasks. A comprehensive explanation of what Lee should do before leaping into the River is as follows: 1. Evaluate the safety of the area: Before jumping into any body of water, it's important to assess the surrounding environment for hazards or obstacles that might cause injury. Lee should take a moment to scan the River for any signs of potential danger. 2. Check water depth: Another crucial safety measure is to make sure the water is deep enough for diving or jumping. Depending on the nature of the river, Lee should either consult local knowledge or test the depth himself to ensure that he won't accidentally strike the riverbed or any submerged rocks. 3. Secure his belongings: To prevent losing or damaging his belongings, Lee should find a safe and dry place to store his possessions, including his beer. 4. Open his beer (if necessary): Depending on whether Lee wants to enjoy his beer before jumping or save it for after, he may need to open the bottle or can at this stage. However, he should be mindful of not littering or disrupting the natural environment with any waste or residue. If he decides to drink it within the river, he should avoid doing so immediately before jumping to reduce the likelihood of spilling or losing the beverage. 5. Close the lock (if applicable): This option assumes that Lee is at a waterway with a lock system in place. If that's the case, closing the lock may be necessary to control the water level or to prevent other boats from passing through while he's in the River. If closing the lock impacts others, Lee should make sure that doing so is permissible and won't negatively affect other users of the waterway. 6. Mow the grass (if relevant): Depending on the location, mowing the grass nearby may be a consideration for Lee, especially if it improves his access to the River or enhances the area's appearance. However, this task may not be necessary or directly related to his jump and could be unrelated to the actual purpose of his visit to the River. 7. Confirm someone is on standby: Though not mentioned in the given options, having a friend or bystander keep an eye on him as he jumps into the River can help ensure his safety and provide assistance if needed. In conclusion, Lee should take several precautionary measures before jumping back into the River after getting his beer. Assessing the safety and depth of the water, securing his belongings, opening his beer, closing the lock if needed, and mowing the grass if relevant are actions he can take to prepare for a safer and more enjoyable experience. Most importantly, having a friend or bystander nearby for support can significantly enhance Lee's overall safety."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: an american who was rescued after nearly eight months in the hands of muslim rebels in the philippines arrived home wednesday to an emotional welcome from his mother and other supporters .","output":"Step 1: Identify the main subjects and key information - American - Rescued - Nearly eight months - Muslim rebels - Philippines - Emotional welcome Step 2: Formulate the sentence structure Subject: American Verb: Rescued Details: After nearly eight months, Muslim rebels in the Philippines, emotional welcome at home Step 3: Create the summary sentence An American who was rescued from Muslim rebels in the Philippines after nearly eight months arrived home to an emotional welcome from his mother and supporters."},{"instruction":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Getting a 4-year-old to eat his lunch of pizza and applesauce on a recent Saturday afternoon wasn't exactly what Sam and Diane McMutrie thought they'd be doing after their three kids grew up.

Renovations continued in 1936 under Plečnik's successor Pavel Janák.

According to a popular rumor, he is said to have placed the Bohemian crown on his head; old legends say a usurper who places the crown on his head is doomed to die within a year. Less than a year after assuming power, on May 27, 1942, Heydrich was attacked during Operation Anthropoid, by British-trained Slovak and Czech soldiers while on his way to the Castle, and died of his wounds - which became infected - a week later. Klaus, his firstborn son, died the next year in a traffic accident, also in line with the legend. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia and the coup in 1948, the Castle housed the offices of the communist Czechoslovak government. After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the castle became the seat of the Head of State of the new Czech Republic.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose sun gives off less radiation happens, how will it affect more radiation trapped by the atmosphere. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If the Sun were to give off less radiation, it would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of radiation trapping by the atmosphere. Direct effect: With less solar radiation reaching the Earth, there would be less energy available for absorption. As a result, the overall amount of radiation going back into space and the amount trapped by the atmosphere would decrease. This could lead to lower average global temperatures and a potential decrease in the effects of global warming. Indirect effect: Lower solar radiation can affect various climate processes, like cloud formation, ocean circulation, and wind patterns. These climate processes can influence the composition of the atmosphere, including the concentration of greenhouse gases, which can either increase or decrease the amount of radiation trapped in the atmosphere. The exact outcome would depend on a complex interplay of factors and is difficult to predict without detailed analysis. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed – the Sun giving off less radiation – would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of radiation trapped by the atmosphere.

However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) annually releases a report called the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which compiles and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the country. These reports provide the most accurate and comprehensive information on crime rates, including violent crimes, in the United States. The latest available UCR report is for 2019, where the estimated number of violent crimes in the U.S. was 1,203,808, a decrease of 0.5% compared to the 2018 estimate. The report defines violent crimes as offenses that involve force or threat of force, which include incidents of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. It is essential to note that crime trends and rates can change year by year, which means fluctuations in annual numbers of violent crimes are expected. So, for a better understanding of crime trends in the U.S., it's helpful to analyze the data over longer periods. Between 1991 and 2019, the U.S. has experienced a substantial decrease in violent crime rates. In 1991, the violent crime rate in the U.S. peaked at around 758 incidents per 100,000 people. Since then, there has been a consistent decline in these rates, and in 2019, the violent crime rate decreased to approximately 366.7 incidents per 100,000 people. However, it is crucial to consider that not all violent crimes are reported to law enforcement agencies. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a significant percentage of violent crime victims do not report incidents to the police due to various reasons, including fear of retaliation, belief that the crime was not significant enough, or distrust of the police. Consequently, the actual number of violent crimes per year may be higher than the figures mentioned in the UCR report. As a result, while the Uniform Crime Reporting Program provides reliable and useful information on violent crime rates in the U.S., one must keep in mind that it is only an estimation based on reported incidents and may not reflect the actual number of cases per year. Nonetheless, the available data and trends suggest a steady decrease in violent crime rates across the United States throughout recent decades."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount.

After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable.

This scheme provided for 20% participation by workers in management committees set up at factory level. The Government abolished the workers' contribution to the Social Security Fund; instead, the employers were made to increase their contribution from 4 to 6%. The government enhanced compensation rates under the Worker's Compensation Act. In 1972 the Bhutto government initially provided for some old age benefits for workers through group insurance, increased rates of compensation and higher rates of gratuity.

But according to a new report, African farmers also have ideas that could help the world fight hunger and poverty. Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara. In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, Ms Nierenberg found women farmers growing vegetables just outside their doorsteps in the Kibera settlement. She says they are finding ways to make their lives better. The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, \\"Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted.\\" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops. And in South Africa and Kenya the report praises the breeding of local kinds of livestock. These animals may produce less milk or meat than other breeds, but they can... We could learn from the new report in Para.1 that _ . A) sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest hunger rate B) African farmers have ideas to help fighting hunger and poverty C) women farmers grow vegetables in the Kibera settlement D) women farmers grow vegetables to send their children to school. The answer is:","output":"B) African farmers have ideas to help fighting hunger and poverty"},{"instruction":"– Jack Daniel McCullough, the ex-cop serving a life sentence for a long-unsolved 1957 Illinois murder, is appealing his 2012 conviction. McCullough, 74, says his mother essentially accused him of Maria Ridulph's murder from the grave—she was sedated and lay dying in a hospital bed when she told McCullough's sisters, \\"John did it,\\" prompting police to re-open the murder investigation. McCullough's attorneys say her accusation should have been considered hearsay and not disclosed in court; testimony revealed she was \\"emotionally disturbed,\\" \\"confused,\\" and at times \\"basically comatose\\" when she said it, and McCullough's sisters gave contradicting testimony on what their mother meant when she said \\"it.\\" McCullough's 80-page appeal also says \\"nostalgia\\" is to blame for his guilty verdict in what CNN calls the \\"coldest case ever solved.\\" \\"I think the problem with Jack's trial is, it was all emotion-based,\\" says McCullough's stepdaughter. WNIJ has a portion of the brief, which lists the evidence against McCullough as: \\"personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident; testimony from jailhouse informants; innocuous statements from the defendant; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant’s mother while on morphine and Haldol just before her death.\\" The star witness in McCullough's trial was Kathy Sigman Chapman, the last person to see Ridulph alive; she never identified McCullough as the stranger who gave her friend a piggyback ride just before her disappearance until 53 years later, and McCullough's appeal says the photo she identified differs from the description of the man she previously gave. His lawyers point out that the judge excluded police and FBI reports from the initial 1957 investigation from current-day testimony, and McCullough was not allowed to present reports from that investigation showing he had been questioned and cleared at the time. The judge also barred a police detective's conclusion in the 1990s that another man, now dead, was the murderer, and prevented McCullough from calling that detective as a witness, the appeal asserts. In another cold case recently solved, an alleged murderer from 1981 was found 33 years later, living as ... a church deacon.

The appeal process has been initiated for what CNN has termed the \\"coldest case ever solved.\\" McCullough's conviction stems from his mother's deathbed accusation that he committed the murder of Maria Ridulph. His mother, who was heavily sedated, stated, \\"John did it,\\" which led police to re-open the murder investigation. McCullough's defense argues that her statement should have been considered hearsay and not presented in court since she was emotionally unstable, confused, and occasionally comatose when she made the statement. Additionally, McCullough's sisters gave conflicting testimonies regarding what their mother meant when she said \\"it.\\" The appeal documents argue that \\"nostalgia\\" played a significant role in McCullough's guilty verdict.

Engines designed to run on diesel fuel operate differently than those designed to run on regular gasoline. Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and instead rely on the compression of the air and fuel to ignite the mixture alone. OPTIONS: A). Diesel fuel can give your vehicle the ability to warm up drastically due to low compression and the higher engine collective. It is considered diesel fuel if the fuel on the tank is less than 150 , 000 a year. B). Because of this, diesel fuel is less stable and cannot be used in engines designed for gasoline. Diesel vehicles usually have clear \\" diesel only \\" markings on the inside of their fuel doors, and traditional gas pumps won't fit in their filler necks. C). Diesel fuel tends to smell strongly of sulfur and rust often because of engine fire. Each engine is different and you should narrow down the range of various fuel types to see what types of fuel were included with your car before choosing your fuel option. D). For the sake of convenience, diesel fuel is necessary when your vehicle is built for air travel. Fuel your vehicle's fuel tank with diesel fuel.","output":"Option B is the most logical next event in the context of choosing the right fuel for your car. Diesel fuel is specifically designed for vehicles that operate on diesel engines. These engines are built differently than gasoline engines and have special requirements that must be met in order to function properly. Because of these differences, using diesel fuel in an engine designed for gasoline can lead to severe damage and costly repairs. One of the significant distinctions between diesel and gasoline engines is that diesel engines do not rely on spark plugs for ignition. Instead, they compress air and fuel to generate the necessary heat and pressure for combustion. Due to this, diesel fuel is formulated differently than gasoline to allow for the specific conditions needed in a diesel engine. When selecting the right fuel for your car, it is vital to pay attention to the type of engine your vehicle has. Typically, diesel vehicles will have clear markings near their fuel doors indicating that they require diesel fuel only. In addition, the fuel nozzle size at most gas stations has been designed so that gasoline pumps will not fit in diesel filler necks, preventing accidental misfueling. It is important to note that using the wrong type of fuel can have serious consequences. These can include damage to the engine and other components, loss of engine power, and even a complete breakdown, necessitating expensive repairs. By ensuring you are always using the appropriate fuel for your vehicle, you can avoid these problems while maintaining optimal performance and increasing the lifespan of your car. In conclusion, when choosing the right fuel for your car, it is essential to consider the type of engine your vehicle has. Be aware of any indications or markings that point to the correct fuel type, and make sure to fuel your vehicle with the appropriate option. Diesel fuel should be used in diesel engines, as is noted in Option B, due to differences in engine design and function – preventing accidental engine damage and ensuring the best performance for your vehicle."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether elevated plasma levels of biomarkers reflecting endothelial dysfunction (E-selectin; intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]; and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1]) predict development of type 2 diabetes in initially nondiabetic women. DESIGN AND SETTING Prospective, nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing US study initiated in 1976. PARTICIPANTS Of 121 700 women initially enrolled, 32 826 provided blood samples in 1989-1990; of those free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline, 737 developed incident diabetes by 2000. Controls (n = 785) were selected according to matched age, fasting status, and race. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Risk of confirmed clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes by baseline levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. RESULTS Baseline median levels of the biomarkers were significantly higher among cases than among controls (E-selectin, 61.2 vs 45.4 ng/mL; ICAM-1, 264.9 vs 247.0 ng/mL; VCAM-1, 545.4 vs 526.0 ng/mL [all P values < or =.004]). Elevated E-selectin and ICAM-1 levels predicted incident diabetes in logistic regression models conditioned on matching criteria and adjusted for body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, smoking, diet score, alcohol intake, activity index, and postmenopausal hormone use. The adjusted relative risks for incident diabetes in the top quintile vs the bottom quintiles were 5.43 for E-selectin (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.47-8.50), 3.56 for ICAM-1 (95% CI, 2.28-5.58), and 1.12 for VCAM-1 (95% CI, 0.76-1.66). Adjustment for waist circumference instead of BMI or further adjustment for baseline levels of C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, and hemoglobin A(1c) or exclusion of cases diagnosed during the first 4 years of follow-up did not alter these associations. CONCLUSION Endothelial dysfunction predicts type 2 diabetes in women independent of other known risk factors, including obesity and subclinical inflammation.

A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries seducing Brian and suspects he may be gay. Brian tells Sally that on three previous occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were \\"the wrong three girls\\".

Answer:","output":"In the movie Cabaret, there are several characters who belong to different nationalities and backgrounds, including German Jews. The film is set in Germany during the final days of the Weimar Republic before the rise of the Nazi regime. The story primarily revolves around Sally Bowles, an American performing at the Kit Kat Klub, and Brian Roberts, a British academic. There are some characters in the story who are German Jews, experiencing the pre-Nazi era in Berlin. Notably, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) is one German Jew in the film. He is a good friend of Brian and is initially presented as a womanizing gigolo. Fritz falls in love with Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), a wealthy Jewish heiress, but initially hides his Jewish identity from her due to self-hatred and fear of discrimination. When Natalia discovers that Fritz is a Jew, despite her hurt feelings, they reconcile, accept their love for each other, and ultimately decide to get married. Natalia Landauer herself is another prominent German Jewish character in Cabaret. Natalia's family is wealthy and owns a large department store in Berlin. She becomes friends with Brian and Sally after Fritz introduces her to Brian as an English language student. Natalia represents the German Jewish community that was well-off before the rise of the Nazis, but soon faced persecution as Hitler gained power. Although other German Jews are not explicitly identified, the presence of the Nazi Party and the consequent persecution of the Jewish community in Berlin becomes tangible as the film progresses. For instance, the musical number \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\" sees a young member of the Hitler Youth singing an anthem for the emerging Nazi movement, slowly revealing the swastika on his sleeve. This scene showcases the growth of the Nazi Party's influence in Germany and the city of Berlin during this time. In conclusion, the central German Jewish characters in Cabaret are Fritz Wendel and Natalia Landauer. Although the primary storyline revolves around the relationship between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Fritz and Natalia's story serves as a reminder of the complex social, political, and cultural context in Berlin during the rise of the Nazi Party and its devastating impact on the German Jewish community."},{"instruction":"Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity.

Tropical wet climates, or equatorial climates, have relatively consistent rainfall and temperatures throughout the year. Conditions in these areas are predominantly warm and humid, with average temperatures exceeding 18 degrees Celsius (64.4 degrees Fahrenheit) for every month. Rainfall in tropical wet climates is often high – typically more than 1,500 millimeters (59 inches) per year. This abundance of moisture supports the growth of tropical rainforests, which are among the world's most biodiverse ecosystems. By contrast, tropical wet and dry climates experience distinct wet and dry seasons, with more variation in precipitation levels compared to tropical wet climates. These climates are also located near the equator, but receive less rainfall overall. During the wet season, which typically spans several months, abundant rainfall supports the growth of vegetation; however, the long dry season that follows can be particularly challenging for plant life. Consequently, the landscape of tropical wet and dry climates is characterized by grasslands and savannas, with scattered trees that have adapted to the alternating wet and dry conditions. Moving on to dry climates, these regions are characterized by a lack of precipitation and high evaporation rates, resulting in a scarcity of available water. Deserts, which fall within this category, can receive as little as 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain annually. It's important to note that while most deserts exhibit high temperatures during the day, temperatures can drop significantly at night. As an AI, I do not have a physical location, so I cannot provide information about rainfall at \\"my house.\\" However, average annual rainfall can differ greatly depending on the location. For instance, London, England, typically experiences roughly 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) of rainfall per year, while Seattle, Washington, has an average annual rainfall of 952 millimeters (37.5 inches).

Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Options: - he could be a pastor - he could secede from Sudan - he would have to fight or die - not enough information A:","output":"he could be a pastor Reasoning: From the context, we know that Abduraheem is a former pastor from Sudan, and though his work as a pastor was not outlawed, Christians face persecution in the predominantly Muslim nation. It is therefore implied that if he were back home, he could potentially continue being a pastor, although facing significant challenges and threats due to his faith."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie is based on the true story of two British athletes competing in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.

Liddell beats Abrahams who takes it extremely badly. But Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer whom Abrahams had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters (John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson).

Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \\"Merchants of Death\\" or \\"The MOD Squad\\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes.

Blood drips off of a meat hook in a burning warehouse, and there is the distant sound of machine gun fire. Joshua Harlow (Ving Rhames) ducks for cover, finding his revolver empty. Off to one side, another man lies wounded, also out of ammunition. The wounded man asks Joshua, 'Don't let it be him.'Joshua checks a mobile device and sees a display with one dot in the center, and another dot rapidly approaching the centered one. Gene Walker (John Lynch), a long-haired man with an automatic rifle arrives on the scene, taunting Joshua and opening fire. He sprays the area with bullets, further wounding the wounded man. Joshua manages to hit a button that causes the meat hooks, some still with large slabs of meat on them, to begin moving, providing him some cover as he runs. A closed-circuit TV camera (CCTV) is shown in one corner of the ceiling as Joshua runs into another room; the armed man following.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas.

C) The noise from urban environments is forcing robins to change their singing patterns. D) Robins are adapting to new environments by mimicking the sounds of industrial machinery.

This step involves the process of consuming and breaking down the food through mechanical processes like chewing and chemical processes like the action of salivary enzymes. Here is a revised version of the process with the missing first step included: 1. The recognition and ingestion of food by the body: When a person consumes food, the digestion process begins through the mechanical act of chewing, which breaks the food down into smaller pieces. At the same time, salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down the food chemically. This mixture of broken-down food and saliva is then swallowed and passed down through the esophagus into the stomach. 2. They secrete digestive juice 'externally' into the small intestine: After the food has been partially digested in the stomach, the chyme (a semi-fluid mixture of partially digested food and stomach secretion) is released into the small intestine. The pancreas releases its digestive juices, containing enzymes that further break down the food components. 3. There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates: The digestive juices secreted by the pancreas contain enzymes such as lipase for breaking down fats, protease for breaking down proteins, and amylase for breaking down carbohydrates. These enzymes help break the complex macromolecules into smaller units that can be easily absorbed by the small intestine. 4. Digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine: The digestive juices released by the pancreas flow through the pancreatic duct and into the small intestine, where they mix with the chyme and continue the process of breaking down the nutrients into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body. 5. When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released: The absorption of glucose (a monosaccharide resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates) by the small intestine causes an increase in blood sugar levels. In response, the pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone which helps to regulate blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose in the body's cells, particularly in the liver and muscles. 6. When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream: In contrast, when blood sugar levels fall below normal levels, such as during periods of fasting or intense physical activity, the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon. Glucagon helps to raise blood sugar levels by stimulating the process of glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose), which is then released into the bloodstream. In summary, the missing first step in the described process is the recognition and ingestion of food, which involves the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food through chewing and the action of salivary enzymes. This initial step is crucial in initiating the various events leading to the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and the regulation of blood sugar levels by the actions of insulin and glucagon."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: DETROIT -- General Motors is set to purchase up to seven percent of French auto giant Peugeot Citroen, sources told Dow Jones Newswires, adding that a deal could be announced as early as Wednesday.

The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet. In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957. Later, on 1 September 1958, Nehru,..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"India. In the 1940s, the people of Sikkim attempted to join India through a vote but failed twice. This led to Sikkim becoming a special protectorate of India, with Indian troops allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The MLA sends a false evidence to the court against Aadhikesavan. But Aadhi sends Dheenadhayalan(Ajith Kumar) who is actually his adopted brother to attack the false evidence. Later some people complain to Aadhi that the MLA had removed the breakwire from a schoolvan due to rivalry between his school and their school leading to the death of many children. Aadhi asks Dheena and his henchmen to cut the hands of the MLA and his men especially the right hand and Dheena completes his task. Meanwhile Dheena falls in love with a girl named Chitra(Laila) who initially mistakes him to be a bus conductor and later a vegetable seller. One day one of Dheena's henchmen ('Mahanathi' Shankar) spots Chitra and her cousin in the plaza and reports to Dheena. Dheena pretends to meet her by chance and pays their bill using the plaza manager's money. One day Chitra calls Dheena's home landline number posing as 'Pepsi' Uma and comes to know about Dheena's tricks. Meanwhile Dheena comes to know that someone (Shyam Ganesh) has teased his sister Shanthi and thrashes him. One day when Dheena meets Chitra they are ridiculed by a gang of rowdies but Dheena stays calm as he thinks that girls hate people who are violent. The next day he meets Chitra at the plaza and tells him he should have beaten the rowdies as she likes violence. As a coincidence the rowdies come and Dheena thrashes them and informs Chitra that he is a local goon. Later she comes to know that Dheena has love for her as she did.

Answer: Aadhi, played by Suresh Gopi, is a gang leader who orders his men to carry out various tasks: 1. Aadhi orders Dheenadhayalan (Dheena), played by Ajith Kumar, to attack the false evidence in court when the MLA sends in a false testimony against Aadhikesavan. Dheena is Aadhi's adopted brother, and Aadhi trusts him to carry out this mission. 2. After receiving complaints that the MLA and his men were responsible for the death of children in a school van accident due to their removal of the brake wire, Aadhi orders Dheena and his henchmen to cut the hands of the MLA and his men, specifically their right hands, as punishment for their actions. Throughout the movie, Aadhi relies on Dheena as his right-hand man to carry out various tasks and assert Aadhi's authority as a gang leader. Regarding the movie plot, Dheena, the central character, becomes involved in a love story with Chitra, a girl who initially confuses him with a bus conductor and later a vegetable seller. Despite their different backgrounds (Dheena being a local goon and Chitra an innocent girl), their love for each other deepens as the movie progresses. However, complications arise when Dheena becomes involved in helping his sister, Shanthi, and her lover elope. Aadhi disapproves of their relationship, causing strife between the siblings. Eventually, Shanthi and her lover are chased down by Aadhi's men, which results in a tragic accident. As a potential investor, you must weigh up the various aspects of the film, including the compelling characters, action-packed sequences, and emotional drama that unfold throughout the story. The film has a mix of both violent and romantic themes, making it suitable for a mature audience seeking action and thrills, as well as those looking for romance.

Americans are outraged over the Bowe Bergdahl sentencing November 3 that should have led to serious prison time or worse. But face it we now live in a country where deserters who cause fellow soldiers to be maimed or killed are treated as heroes if weak leftists are in charge. He should be in prison. The only difference between Bergdahl and the guy who used a Home Depot truck to mow down and kill people in New York recently is that Bergdahl displayed his allegiance to the enemy on foreign soil. Bergdahl walked because the military swamp remains filled with senior leaders who climbed the ranks curtseying to former President Obamaâs social experimentation and his upside-down value system whereby one treasonous deserter is worth five senior Taliban terrorists. Obama exchanged five of Gitmoâs finest for Bergdahl then hosted a sickening spectacle at the White House Rose Garden where a touchy-feely Obama spoke to Bergdahl âs parents âcourage.â Meanwhile Obamaâs favorite fact-twister former National Security Advisor Susan Rice made her rounds propagandizing that Bergdahl served with âhonor and distinction.â Now âthis punkâ walks thanks to in part the judge in charge Col. Jeffrey R. Nance who once said at a Fort Bragg hearing: âI will consider the presidentâs [Trumpâs] comments [regarding Bergdahl] as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence.â Nance was referring to Trumpâs less-than- complementary comments about Bergdahl . Obviously Col. Nance did just that essentially presenting Bergdahl a snowflake award punishing him with the equivalent of a hand slap despite six soldiers killed and others permanently maimed. I also believe Obamaâs and Riceâs comments about Bergdahl helped to tip the scales of justice in the wrong direction not Trumpâs. At times and when politics arenât in play military justice can be swift painful and fair. Not this time and especially not for the brave warriors maimed and killed while searching for Bergdahl . Col. Nance rewarded a traitor and Obama freed dangerous enemies most likely to face us once more in some future battle plain and simple.

With a private jet and helicopter at their beck and call and al fresco dining at 3,500 metres (11,500 feet), it was the kind of weekend even Prince Harry is likely never to forget. Further details of the royal’s controversial - and, clearly, very lavish - ski holiday to Kazakhstan emerged yesterday and are unlikely to sit comfortably with human rights campaigners who have already condemned the trip. Friends of the fourth in line to throne have openly boasted about their four-day jaunt, even posting pictures from inside their plane on social media. Scroll down for video. The royal couple: Cressida Bonas and Harry in Kazakhstan, with his police protection officer behind them. Polar explorer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend, shared an image of his pretty wife, Anna, toasting the experience from the comfort of her leather-lined seat on Instagram he bragged: ‘Anna looks very happy for the “upgrade” from Ryanair this weekend : - ) #adventure #backtoreality’. His wife replied: ‘Best weekend ever : - )’ and Tweeted from the flight: ‘Amaaazing weekend. Feeling blessed.’ Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch, with furs thrown over their chairs and woven rugs placed on the grass. Amnesty International has accused the Queen’s grandson of exercising poor judgement by holidaying in a country with such an appalling human rights record. The country’s despotic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been accused of torturing and killing political opponents, stifling press freedom and profiteering from his country’s vast reserves of oil and gas. Kensington Palace have refused to comment on the prince’s ‘private’ trip or discuss who bankrolled it, although sources close to the prince insist he was merely ‘tagging along’ after being invited by friends. The Czech model: Tereza Maxova is the girlfriend of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country and is believed to have paid for the trip. However the Mail understands that it was paid for by Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country. It is understood that Mr Oymen, who lives in Monaco but has homes in several countries, sent his private plane to London to collect Harry, 29, his girlfriend of two years, Cressida Bonas, as well as Norwegian-born Mr Solheim and his wife. His long-term partner, Czech model Tereza Maxova, later published a picture taken during the weekend of a lavish picnic with the caption: ‘Shashlik [a type of Russian kebab] at 3,500m.’ Mr Oymen, 40, is the son of a senior Turkish politician and co-founder of commercial real estate developers Capital Partners. He and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who himself has close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed. In a recent interview he boasted how he wished to turn the once down-at-heel Soviet downhill ski training centre into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’. Sources close to the prince flatly deny any links between Harry and Mr Oymen and say he had never met him before the trip and has no plans to meet him again, despite his lavish hospitality.

Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch. But having the Queen’s grandson grace the developer’s fledging ski resort with his presence will clearly do little harm to its public image. Mr Oymen was also behind the building of Kazakhstan’s first luxury goods mall and hotel development which opened last year in a blaze of publicity. The property mogul flew out supermodel Eva Herzigova for the champagne-laced occasion which brought firms including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Armani to the oil-rich Kazakhstani elite. Calls to his office in Almaty were not being answered yesterday. The man behind the holiday is respected 41-year-old adventurer Inge Solheim, who recently led Prince Harry on a charity trek to the South Pole for the Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured service personnel. The prince’s team included several seriously injured servicemen and women and a documentary on the team’s remarkable achievement recently aired on ITV. His glamorous wife, Anna, who works as a luxury brand social media manager, posted a series of pictures taken during their weekend on the internet. All are on freely accessible sites. One showed the royal party boarding the Government-owned helicopter that chauffeured them to and from the slopes each day saying:. ‘First attempt at #helli-skiing. Eek! 4100 meters up. #altitudesickness.’ Prince Harry was attacked by human rights campaigners for taking a private jet to enjoy a weekend's skiing in Kazakhstan. Pose: Harry was happy to take photographs with members of the public while skiing. She also shared a video she had shot from inside the former Soviet military helicopter showing her husband and what appears to be Prince Harry skiing toward her, with the words: ‘Waiting in the #chopper for hubbie to appear over the horizon #heliski’. As recently as Sunday there was another ‘selfie’ showing her tucking into some delicacies picked up during the trip. The caption read: ‘eating #caviar from #kazakhstan with salmon & cream cheese #2spoiltgirls’. Mr Solheim’s spokesman did not return calls yesterday. Another photograph from the weekend, which emerged yesterday, shows Harry and his girlfriend accompanied by one of the prince’s most trusted personal protection officers. The same officer was pictured with him in a Jacuzzi on the prince’s notorious holiday to Las Vegas where he was photographed playing a game of naked billiards in a hotel suite. Local reports say the couple were met at their private jet by the ski resort manager, and stayed in a ‘cosy cottage’ close to the main slope. The couple also enjoyed hiking and glacier climbing and on their last day flew to the Dmitiev Glacier for a spot of heli-skiing.","output":"Rebecca English, in her article, sheds light on Prince Harry's extravagant ski holiday in Kazakhstan that critics say raises some ethical questions vis-à-vis the host country's human rights record. The royal holiday, organised by polar explorer Inge Solheim, was marked by private jets, helicopters, and luxurious mountaintop meals, garnering strong criticism from human rights campaigners. According to the report, the attendees openly celebrated their four-day outing, sharing images of their opulent escapade on social media platforms. Solheim's wife, Anna, was among those who toasted to the weekend adventure from her leather lined seat in the aircraft, sharing her excitement over the trip on Instagram. Prince Harry's trip to Kazakhstan, ruled by controversial figure Nursultan Nazarbayev, soon sparked discussion among human rights activists. Amnesty International criticised the Prince's vacation in a country charged with a poor human rights record, including accusations of torturing and killing political opponents. Critics also raised concerns about the alleged censorship of press freedom and the profiteering from the country's oil and gas reserves under Nazarbayev's leadership. While Kensington Palace declined to comment on the royal's private trip or reveal the sponsor, the article discloses that the trip was financed by Burak Oymen, a Turkish native property developer profiting substantially from Kazakhstan's luxury development projects. Contrary to his financial involvement in the vacation, the connection between Harry and Oymen was downplayed by sources close to the Prince. They stated that he had never met Oymen prior to the trip and does not intend to do so afterward, notwithstanding his generous hosting. More details revealed that the trip was orchestrated by adventurer Inge Solheim. He is well-known to Harry, having recently led him in a charity trek to the South Pole for the 'Walking With The Wounded' charity, in support of injured servicemen and women. The choice of destination has been justified by its potential advertising value to Oymen's budding ski resort, which he aims to recast as the 'Courcheval of Kazakhstan'. The article asserts that the presence of the Queen’s grandson in Oymen's fledgling ski resort can uplift its public profile significantly. In a bid to cater to Kazakhstan's wealthy class, Oymen was also instrumental in establishing Kazakhstan's first luxury merchandise mall—a move that received massive publicity—with supermodel Eva Herzigova being present for the occasion. The holiday had its moments of thrill and adventure as well, featuring helicopter skiing. Pictures from the trip portrayed Prince Harry and his girlfriend, accompanied by one of the prince’s most entrusted personal protection officers, frolicking in the fun. Prince Harry's luxurious Kazakh adventure continues to draw flak from critics, questioning the ethical dimensions of fraternising with countries harbouring questionable human rights records.

Alerting Additional Units: With the situation escalating, backup was requested, and additional police units were dispatched to assist in the pursuit. 3. Attempting Communication: Throughout the ordeal, police attempted to establish communication with the rogue bus driver via multiple channels, including loudspeakers and hand gestures. However, all attempts were ignored. Shots Fired: As the driver showed no signs of relenting, matters grew increasingly desperate. To protect the public and bring the reckless drive to an end, officers made the difficult decision to fire shots at the bus. They aimed at the tires and engine to disable the vehicle, making sure to minimize further risks. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, the police were unsuccessful in stopping the bus through gunfire. Although officers were able to hit the vehicle several times, the driver persisted, seemingly unfazed by the attempts to halt his dangerous journey. The Capture and Conclusion: After 30 harrowing minutes and an incredible 17-mile chase through the heart of Pune, the bus driver was finally captured. Thanks to the relentless efforts of the cooperative police units, the vehicle was forced to a stop, and the driver was taken into custody without further incident.

Their actions have undoubtedly saved countless lives and demonstrated their commitment to upholding public safety. In the days to come, a full investigation will be launched to determine the driving force behind this unsettling event, as well as assess the lessons learned and implement necessary improvements to prevent similar occurrences in the future."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

As creatures of vivid imaginations, we are uniquely susceptible to the power of suggestion; in many instances, it is the unseen terror that causes the most profound unease. Experienced directors know that to make horror truly effective, a film must not only capture the audience's imagination but grip it tightly with a sense of dread and uncertainty. This article will outline key techniques to accentuate the fear factor, focusing on the adage that the evils we don't see are far scarier than the ones we can. 1. Create a Shot List for Every Scene Before Shooting Crafting a comprehensive shot list is an indispensable step in the pre-production process. By meticulously planning the camera angles, lens choices, composition, and lighting, filmmakers can create an intricately woven tapestry of suspense and terror. A well-thought-out shot list enables the director and cinematographer to explore different perspectives, highlight critical moments, and ensure that the subtlest of scares hit home. 2. Review Everything in Advance To enhance the sense of dread and anticipation, it is essential to review all scripts, storyboards, and shot lists beforehand to ensure all technical and creative aspects align with the intended vision. Rehearsing with the actors, studying the locations, and understanding the practicalities of shooting each scene will allow the production team to anticipate potential challenges and avoid costly mistakes on set. Furthermore, advanced preparation fosters a smoother shooting process that leaves room for improvisation and creative exploration. 3. Light Your Shots More Than You Think You Need To Enhancing fear by withholding visual information requires a delicate balance of lighting to simultaneously conceal and reveal elements within a scene. While dimly lit scenes are standard horror tropes, it is crucial to carefully define objects, shapes, and shadows to manipulate the viewer's perception. By intentionally over-lighting a shot, the filmmaker can then dial back the exposure to create the perfect blend of darkness and unease, all while preserving crucial details. 4. Set the Blocking for Each Long Scene Precisely choreographing the actors' movements and positions on set for each extended scene is essential for seamless storytelling. Long takes can heighten tension and create an unrelenting atmosphere if executed correctly. During blocking, the director must work with the actors and cinematographer to ensure the camera moves fluidly, avoiding obstacles and capturing a smooth framing of the unfolding action. This collaborative process will ensure that the horror and suspense are sustained throughout the scene. 5. Make Your Special Effects with Care Nothing pulls an audience out of the immersive experience of horror faster than poorly executed special effects. Whether practical or digital, the quality of a film's visual effects is critical in maintaining the suspension of disbelief and eliciting genuine fear. It is crucial to invest time and resources in refining the effects, as even the smallest inconsistency can undermine an otherwise well-executed and terrifying scene. 6. Shoot Extra Atmospheric Shots Whenever You Can Atmosphere and mood are key components of horror films. Ensuring that your finished film evokes a palpable sense of dread requires the inclusion of atmospheric shots to augment the narrative. Capturing additional footage of misty landscapes, unsettled skies, or foreboding architecture will not only add depth and context to your film but also contribute to the overall chilling aesthetic and unease that characterizes the horror genre. Conclusion The most potent horror films are those that leave a powerful lasting impression on the audience by teasing their fears and stimulating their imaginations. By thoroughly planning intricate shot lists, lighting setups, and blocking, as well as meticulously crafting special effects and atmospheric shots, filmmakers can amplify the terror and suspense that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Ultimately, it is the nuanced mastery of these techniques that give the unseen evils the power to haunt the audience long after the film has ended."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial.

Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China.

On the first series of the game, the Jets drove to the Patriots' 13-yard line but the game remained scoreless after kicker Jay Feely missed a 31-yard field goal. Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game.

The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The composition that premiered in March 1905 is Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, by Carl Nielsen. It is his second major choral work and sets to music the various phases of sleep, including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: Season with cumin and either blend or mash everything with a fork.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. - The Kingdom of France was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Western Europe, the predecessor of the modern French Republic. It was one of the most powerful states in Europe, a great power since the Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War. It was also an early colonial power, with possessions around the world. - The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom (\\"Teutonic Kingdom\\") developed out of the eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire. Like Anglo-Saxon England and medieval France, it began as \\"a conglomerate, an assemblage of a number of once separate and independent... \\"gentes\\" [peoples] and \\"regna\\" [kingdoms].\\" East Francia (\\"Ostfrankenreich\\") was formed by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty until 911, after which the kingship was elective. The initial electors were the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy (after 951), Bohemia (after 1004) and Burgundy (after 1032). - The Savoy-Carignano family, was a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. It was founded by Thomas Francis of Savoy, Prince of Carignano 21 December 1596 - 22 January 1656), an Italian military commander. His descendants were accepted as \\"princes étrangers\\" at the court of France, where some held prominent positions, eventually coming to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861 and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty's deposition in 1946. The Savoy-Carignanos also, briefly, supplied a king each to Spain and to Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal. - The Dauphiné or Dauphiné Viennois, formerly Dauphiny in English, is a former province in southeastern France, whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present departments of Isère, Drôme, and Hautes-Alpes.

Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. - The Jura Mountains are a sub-alpine mountain range located north of the Western Alps, mainly following the course of the FranceSwitzerland border. The Jura separates the Rhine and Rhône basins, forming part of the watershed of each. - Lake Geneva (or ' , sometimes ' ) is a lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France. It is one of the largest lakes in Western Europe and the largest on the course of the Rhône. 59.53% of it comes under the jurisdiction of Switzerland (cantons of Vaud, Geneva, and Valais), and 40.47% under France (department of Haute-Savoie). - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state. - Savoy is a cultural region in southeast France. It comprises roughly the territory of the Western Alps between Lake Geneva in the north and Dauphiné in the south. - The House of Savoy is one of the oldest royal families in the world, being founded in 1003 in the historical Savoy region. Through gradual expansion, it grew from ruling a small county in that region to the attainment of the rank of king (of Sicily) in 1713. Through its junior branch, the House of Savoy-Carignano, it led the unification of Italy in 1861 and ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 until 1946 and, briefly, the Kingdom of Spain in the 19th century. The Savoyard kings of Italy were Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I, Victor Emmanuel III, and Umberto II. The last monarch ruled for a few weeks before being deposed following the Constitutional Referendum of 1946, after which the Italian Republic was proclaimed. - The Kingdom of Bohemia, sometimes in English literature referred to as the Czech Kingdom ( sometimes ), was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Central Europe, the predecessor of the modern Czech Republic.

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - The House of Habsburg, also called House of Hapsburg, or House of Austria, was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740.

From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - Habsburg Spain refers to the history of Spain over the 16th and 17th centuries (15161700), when it was ruled by kings from the House of Habsburg (also associated with its role in the history of Central Europe). The Habsburg rulers (chiefly Charles I and Philip II) reached the zenith of their influence and power. They controlled territory that included the Americas, the East Indies, the Low Countries and territories now in France and Germany in Europe, the Portuguese Empire from 1580 to 1640, and various other territories such as small enclaves like Ceuta and Oran in North Africa. This period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the \\"Age of Expansion\\". - The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps (, ), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called \\"Central Alps\\". While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. - The Kingdom of Portugal was a monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of modern Portugal. It was in existence from 1139 until 1910. After 1248, it was also known as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves and between 1815 and 1822, it was known as the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm's extensive overseas colonies. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Kingdom of Ireland (Classical Irish: '; Modern Irish: ') was a client state of the Kingdom of England that existed on Ireland from 1542 until 1800. It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown. - The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the twentieth century (10001946 with the exception of 19181920). The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom in about the year 1000; his family (the Árpád dynasty) led the monarchy for 300 years. By the 12th century, the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world. - Jure uxoris is a Latin term that means \\"by right of (his) wife\\". \\"Jure\\" is the ablative case of \\"jus\\", meaning a legal right. It is most commonly used to refer to a title of nobility held by a man because his wife holds it \\"suo jure\\" (\\"in her own right\\"). Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands \\"jure uxoris\\", \\"by right of [his] wife\\", as in England where, until the Married Women's Property Act 1882, married women were legally incapable of owning real estate. \\"Jure uxoris\\" monarchs are not to be confused with kings consort, who were merely consorts of their wives, not co-rulers. - Bohemia is the westernmost and largest historical region of the Czech lands in the present-day Czech Republic. In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including Moravia and Czech Silesia, especially in a historical context, such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - The Mexican Empire or Second Mexican Empire was the name of Mexico under a limited hereditary monarchy declared by the Assembly of Notables on July 10, 1863, during the Second French intervention in Mexico. It was created with the support of Napoleon III of France, who attempted to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas. A referendum confirmed the coronation of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, of the House of Habsburg as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. - The House of Kyburg was a noble family of grafen ( counts ) from Zürich in Switzerland . The family was one of the three most powerful noble families in the Swiss plateau beside the House of Habsburg and the House of Savoy during the 11th and 12th centuries . With the extinction of the Kyburg family 's male line in 1263 , Rudolph of Habsburg laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them to the Habsburg holdings , which marked the beginning of the Habsburgs ' rise to power .

They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry. She asks Clarence if the chalkboard looks blurry and he says that it looks clear to him. Molly will ask her mom about it when she gets home from school today. But I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. What is an answer for this question: Which child isn't nearsighted? A:","output":"A: Clarence is the child who isn't nearsighted.

Article: Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly.

From my experience, my waiter was extremely attentive and very patient. The waiter was also very helpful and knowledgeable when choosing from the menu. He was attentive in the sense that he was watching us like a hawk, making sure each dish was properly served within precise timing. We were not overwhelmed when going from dish to dish, leaving room for rest in between. I'm not a fan of being rushed into each dish I order, as if I'm being served from an assembly line. Sitting at the counter seats facing the kitchen, I believe, made for a more enjoyable experience. I would suggest it with the intent that you'll probably have a better time than at a table... at least I did. Normally I'm not one to sit at seats facing a kitchen, but because this restaurant is very small and intimate, there are only a few chefs at work and you won't leave the restaurant smelling like the restaurant. You can watch how meticulously the chefs put together meals to perfection. I was lucky enough to try several things which were 'compliments of the Chef.' Decided to go for individual plates rather than opt for the tasting menu. I'm glad I did...

Not saying that it wasnt a good steak (its only hanger steak after all) but the winner was the potato puree. It was definitely a very small 'boutique' serving, but the flavor was amazing. I feel like an idiot because I can't remember the exact name of the butter which is used to make it, but my waiter had mentioned that it was some sort of imported French butter (if anyone knows what it is, please inform me so I can edit this!). Whatever it was, it totally made the potato puree. The decor was interesting and I kind of liked the concept of placing various vegetables in large jars/vases/bowls/etc., by color coordination. It makes for a nice touch, with pops of color spread throughout, against a stark black environment with touches of red furniture.. very contemporary. Its unfortunate that when you walk out of this small, posh oasis, you're thrown into the tackiness of Vegas culture: endless casino with disgusting, utterly tasteless decor and cheesy carpets.

During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced in the gonads. The androgens produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens. In adult women, they may contribute to the sex drive, but their function in adult men is not well understood.

The sentence is from a movie review, so it may contain a subjective opinion. 2. The sentence mentions \\"offended by his lack of faith in his audience.\\" This suggests that the reviewer felt the movie creator did not trust or believe in the audience's ability to understand or appreciate the movie. 3. The reviewer being \\"offended\\" implies a negative emotion or reaction to this perception.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: What did Meg do after her anger simmered? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"After Meg's anger simmered, she likely reflected on the situation and tried to understand the perspectives of the different individuals involved. As an elderly woman, she may have felt that her right to sit in the designated seat was being challenged or disregarded, especially considering the racial undertones in the scenario. Additionally, the lack of air conditioning and the hot day would have added to the overall discomfort and stress of the situation for everyone involved. However, as time passed and she had the opportunity to think about your response - to offer it up to God - Meg might have realized that sometimes, we all have to make small sacrifices or adjustments for the greater good. In this case, it was to allow the young couple to secure their baby's pram, ensuring the safety of the child and allowing the bus to continue on its route. Meg may have also tried to clear her thoughts by taking deep breaths and focusing on the present moment, using techniques such as mindfulness to calm herself down. Reflecting on the overarching importance of compassion and understanding for the circumstances of others, Meg might have started to feel a sense of empathy not just for the young couple but also for the other passengers who were also inconvenienced by the situation. Additionally, Meg could have potentially decided to use this experience as a lesson for personal growth and understanding the struggles that people from different backgrounds and age groups might face. The situation could have served as a reminder that not everything is black and white, and that sometimes, difficult decisions need to be made for the well-being of everyone involved. It might have also highlighted the importance of gratitude, patience, and resilience in the face of unexpected situations. In conclusion, after Meg's anger simmered, she would have likely tried to find ways to cope with her emotions, understand different perspectives, and learn valuable lessons from the experience to apply in future situations. This could have led to her becoming more empathetic, patient, and conscious of the challenges faced by others around her, ultimately contributing to her personal growth."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

A third album , once again on Dragonfly , was released in 2003 . A third album , then on Dragonfly , was again released in 2003 . Pick from: [A]. no [B]. yes","output":"To determine if the two phrases have the same meaning, let's analyze them step-by-step. 1. First, we identify the main subjects and actions in both sentences. Sentence 1: A third album (subject), was released (action) in 2003. Sentence 2: A third album (subject), was again released (action) in 2003. In both sentences, the subject is \\"a third album\\" and the action refers to it being released in 2003. The difference lies in the use of \\"once again\\" in Sentence 1 and \\"again\\" in Sentence 2. 2. Next, let's examine the additional information provided in each sentence. Sentence 1: once again on Dragonfly Sentence 2: then on Dragonfly Both sentences mention \\"Dragonfly,\\" which is likely a record label. However, Sentence 1 uses \\"once again\\" to emphasize that the album was released on Dragonfly for the second time (or even more). In contrast, Sentence 2 uses \\"then\\" which indicates a sequence of events, possibly implying that the album was released on Dragonfly after being released on a different label. 3. Based on the analysis, let's determine if the two sentences have the same meaning. While both sentences describe a third album being released in 2003 on Dragonfly, the phrases \\"once again\\" and \\"then\\" give slightly different connotations in each sentence. The first sentence emphasizes the repeated association with Dragonfly, while the second sentence adds a sense of sequence or change.

(2) The book costs five krona., does the word krona mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, in both sentences, the word \\"krona\\" refers to the same concept, which is a unit of currency. Krona is the official currency of Sweden and its plural form, \\"kronor\\", might be used when referring to multiple krona units. However, it is not uncommon for English speakers to use \\"krona\\" as both singular and plural when discussing the Swedish currency. In the first sentence, \\"You can use paper krona (i.e., bills, banknotes).\\", krona means the physical representation of the currency in the form of paper bills or banknotes, which can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services. The sentence indicates that the user can make a transaction using the specified form of currency, i.e., paper krona. In the second sentence, \\"The book costs five krona.\\", krona is again used to express the currency, representing the amount needed to purchase the book. In this sentence, the price of the book is stated as five units of Swedish currency. Despite not specifying the form (coins, bills, or digital currency), the primary concept remains the same, referring to the Swedish unit of currency.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering whether it is safe to drive after consuming alcohol, there are several factors that come into play, including the amount of alcohol consumed, the individual's alcohol tolerance, and the time elapsed between alcohol intake and driving. Initially, one might think that consuming a small amount of alcohol may not cause significant impairment of driving abilities. However, studies have shown that even low levels of alcohol in the bloodstream can impair reaction times and cognitive functioning. Moreover, alcohol affects different individuals differently, making it difficult to predict a safe threshold for consumption. Additionally, while alcohol may metabolize at a steady rate, individual metabolism rates vary, and residual effects may persist even after the blood alcohol content reduces. Crucially, driving under the influence of alcohol raises the risk of accidents, which may potentially cause injury or death to oneself or others on the road.

After the oxygen fills the sacs (alveoli) in your lungs, it diffuses into the bloodstream through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, which then transports it to the body cells for cellular respiration. Simultaneously, your body cells release carbon dioxide as a waste product, which is carried by red blood cells back to the lungs. In the lungs, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood vessels into the alveoli, where it is then expelled from the body when you exhale. This entire process, which includes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, is known as external respiration.

Transportation and support: On the day of surgery, transport your dog to the veterinary clinic safely and securely. It is essential to keep your dog calm and stress-free, making sure you provide comfort and emotional support. 5. Monitor your dog during the recovery period: After the surgery, your dog will require special attention and care during the recovery period. Your veterinarian will provide you with specific instructions on how to care for the surgical site, pain management, feeding, and other essential factors. Make sure to follow those instructions carefully to prevent complications and ensure a smooth recovery. 6. Preventing infection and complications: Keep the surgical site clean and dry, and ensure your dog cannot lick or bite at the incision to prevent infection. If you notice any signs of swelling, discharge, or pain, contact your veterinarian immediately. 7. Follow-up appointments: Attend any follow-up appointments scheduled by your veterinarian to monitor your dog's healing progress. These appointments may include suture removal, checking for infections, or post-operative exams. 8. Adjusting to the new routine: After the recovery period, your dog may have some hormonal changes, and their heat cycle will stop, leading to some behavioral adjustments. Support your dog during this transition and maintain a regular exercise routine and a balanced diet. 9. Spay/neuter awareness: Spread awareness about the importance of spaying and neutering dogs and cats to reduce the stray animal population, prevent health issues related to hormonal imbalances, and encourage responsible pet ownership. In conclusion, the most logical next event after determining how to pay for the spaying surgery to prevent pyometra in dogs is scheduling the surgery, consulting with the veterinarian, preparing your dog, and closely monitoring the recovery process. Following these steps will significantly decrease the risk of pyometra and allow your dog to lead a healthier, happier life."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Aromi, eatType = pub, customer rating = high, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

(Bill Peer, who had a country music band in Brunswick, MD, also had an infant daughter named Patsy). In 1955 he gained a contract for her at Four Star Records, the label he was then affiliated with. Four Star was under contract to the Coral subsidiary of Decca Records. Patsy signed with Decca at her first opportunity three years later. Her first contract allowed her to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking that nobody else would have her, she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was \\"A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye,\\" which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not \\"records\\" per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason. This somewhat eased her \\"stifled\\" feeling. Between 1955 and 1957, Cline recorded honky tonk material, with songs like \\"Fingerprints,\\" \\"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,\\" \\"Don't Ever Leave Me Again,\\" and \\"A Stranger In My Arms.\\" Cline co-wrote the last two. None of these songs gained notable success. She experimented with rockabilly. According to Decca Records producer Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only hinted at Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that her voice was best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley tried to get her to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.

He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Sabina Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge (imparted by an angel's voice that speaks in German) that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse (since her mother was unfaithful). Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin.Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleule (André Hennicker), the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. I am facing a new situation today: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B? Answer:","output":"Car A, which is equipped with a catalytic converter, would emit less carbon monoxide than Car B, which does not have a catalytic converter. The primary reason for this difference in emissions can be attributed to the function of the catalytic converter in Car A. Catalytic converters play a crucial role in reducing the harmful emissions produced by internal combustion engines found in cars like A and B. As mentioned in the background article, these converters increase the rate of several important reactions, while simultaneously transforming harmful emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO) into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide (CO2). In Car A, the catalytic converter facilitates the oxidation of CO to CO2. This process involves the carbon monoxide molecule reacting with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, which is typically made from metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium. The catalyst helps accelerate the rate of this reaction, increasing the efficiency of the process and reducing the amount of CO that is released into the environment. In contrast, Car B lacks a catalytic converter, so the harmful substances produced by the engine, such as carbon monoxide, are emitted into the atmosphere without undergoing any sort of treatment. Consequently, Car B would release a higher amount of carbon monoxide compared to Car A. In summary, Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than Car B due to the presence and function of a catalytic converter in Car A. The catalytic converter aids in converting the harmful carbon monoxide gas into a less harmful substance, thereby mitigating the environmental impact and promoting cleaner air quality."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear....

Unreceived Product: The most obvious concern expressed by the reviewer is that the product has not been delivered to them. This is a fundamental aspect of any online shopping experience – receiving the ordered item. Failure to get the product indicates a major issue with this particular product or company. The reviewer may believe that the company does not take proper care in ensuring timely delivery, or worse, has cheated them out of their money. 2. Poor Customer Support: The reviewer mentions that none of their emails have been answered. This might be seen as a sign of a lack in communication or responsiveness from the company, which is disappointing for any customer. It shows that the company may not prioritize or value their customer's concerns or complaints. 3. Unrefunded Money: Another major point of dissatisfaction is that the reviewer's money has not been refunded. This highlights the company's potential inability or unwillingness, to address and correct their mistakes. It could give the impression that the company is not trustworthy or reliable. 4.

Choose a relevant scenario: Select a scenario that involves common physical interactions, such as the movement of objects or the application of forces. Task Scenario: Move a heavy box to a designated area on the other side of the room. 3. Set up the task constraints: Create constraints that require strong physical reasoning abilities to overcome the hurdles. - The box weighs 50 kg (110 lbs) and is too heavy to be lifted by the person. - The floor is smooth and even, with no obstacles. - The task must be completed using only the items available in the room, such as a small dolly (with a 60-kg weight capacity), a length of rope, and a sturdy stick. 4. Specify the expected outcome: Define the end result to determine the task's successful completion. - The heavy box should be placed in the designated area on the other side of the room. 5. Divide the task into smaller steps: Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps that require physical reasoning to complete successfully. Step 1: Evaluate the size of the box and determine if it fits onto the dolly. Step 2: Tilt the box on one edge and slide the dolly under the box. Step 3: Secure the box onto the dolly using the rope, making sure it does not slip or topple over. Step 4: Use the stick as a lever to help balance the box on the dolly and maneuver it across the room. Step 5: Carefully navigate the box and dolly toward the designated area, avoiding any possible obstacles. Step 6: Once at the designated area, untie the rope and carefully remove the box from the dolly. This task requires the individual to: - Understand the concepts of weight and leverage - Apply their knowledge of friction and forces - Use critical thinking to determine the items and resources available to accomplish the task - Problem-solve using physical reasoning and strategy By following these steps and justifications, an individual can be tested on their ability to perform physical reasoning effectively."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia? ? John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","output":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia.

Input: The film is set in 1920s China during the warlord era, years before the Chinese Civil War. Nineteen-year-old Songlian ( Sònglián, played by Gong Li), whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, marries into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress ( Sì tàitai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly-lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.Songlian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine he will spend the night with; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections.The First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun ( Zhuóyún, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan ( Méishn, He Caifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.Songlian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er ( Yàn'ér, played by Kong Lin) who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.Zhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's \\"pregnancy\\". Doctor Gao ( Go-yshng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a Mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the Master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.Yan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a \\"robe\\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.As Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun; who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room on the roof of the estate and hanged to death by the master's servants.Songlian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the master's marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, having gone completely insane.

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Context: B7-H1, a co-inhibitory molecule of the B7 family, is found aberrantly expressed in ovarian cancer cells and infiltrating macrophage/dendritic-like cells, and plays a critical role in immune evasion by ovarian cancer. IL-12, an inducer of Th1 cell development, exerts immunomodulatory effects on ovarian cancer. However, whether IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in human ovarian cancer associated-macrophages has not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IL-12 on the expression of B7-H1 in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages and possible mechanisms.', 'PMA induced THP-1-derived macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) or infected with adenovirus carrying human IL-12 gene (Ad-IL-12-GFP) for 24 h, then cocultured with the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line for another 24 h. Macrophages were collected for real-time PCR and Western blot to detect the expression of B7-H1, and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, supernatants were collected to assay for IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-10 by ELISA. In addition, monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ were cocultured with SKOV3 and determined for the expression of B7-H1. Furthermore, the expression of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was also evaluated after blocking NF-κB signaling.', 'The expression of B7-H1 was significantly upregulated in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP compared with the control groups (p<0.05), accompanied by a remarkable upregulation of IFN-γ (p<0.05), a marked downregulation of IL-10 (p<0.05) and activation of NF-κB signaling. However, the upregulation of B7- H1 was inhibited by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway (p<0.05). Expression of B7-H1 was also increased (p<0.05) in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ and cocultured with SKOV3. By contrast, the expression of B7-H1 in THP-1-derived macrophages was significantly decreased when treated in the same way as monocyte-derived macrophages (p<0.05), and IL-10 was also significantly decreased but IFN-γ was almost absent.Question: Does iL-12 regulate B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signalling?","output":"Task: Determine whether IL-12 regulates B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages by effects on NF-κB signaling based on context provided. Guidelines: 1. Read the context to understand the relation between IL-12 and B7-H1 expression in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages. 2. Identify the experiments conducted for the clarification. 3. Note the results and outcomes of the experiments. 4. Determine the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation process. Solution: 1. The context talks about IL-12 playing a role in the immunomodulation of ovarian cancer and its effect on the expression of B7-H1 in ovarian cancer-associated macrophages. 2. Experiments conducted include treating macrophages with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP, coculturing with SKOV3 cells, blocking NF-κB signaling, and analyzing cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ, and IL-10) by ELISA. 3. Results show a significant upregulation of B7-H1 in monocyte-derived macrophages treated with rIL-12 or Ad-IL-12-GFP, accompanied by upregulation of IFN-γ, downregulation of IL-10, and activation of NF-κB signaling. B7-H1 upregulation was inhibited when NF-κB signaling was blocked. 4.

While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.

A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Not satisfied with having a car that has a 1:1 horsepower to weight ratio, Swedish hypercar maker Koenigsegg has gone a step further, debuting the hybrid, 1,500-horsepower Regera at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The Regera is a triumph of speed engineering, and the numbers that Koenigsegg are claiming are staggering: 0-60 in 2.8-seconds, 93-155 in 3.2-seconds, and can reach its top speed of 249-mph in less than 20-seconds. That puts the Regera above and beyond the likes of the Porsche 918, LaFerrari, and McLaren P1 in terms of outright acceleration. But how does the Regera achieve these stellar numbers? Through the clever use of hybrid technology, lightweight materials, and an advanced direct-drive transmission. We're about to get a bit technical, so bear with us if your eyes glaze over upon reading this. In concept, the Regera is similar to the aforementioned hypercars, combining the at least 800-horsepower from its 5.0-liter turbocharged V-8 and 670-horsepower from the three-motor electric drivetrain. That makes for a total output of potentially over 1,500-horsepower and as much as 1,475 lb.-ft. of torque. In theory, it sounds fairly simple, but its the transmission and engine configuration that makes the Regera so unique. One 215-hp motor sits at the crankshaft and serves as a starter motor, and two more reside at each rear wheel, putting out 241-hp each. The Regera is fully-electric up to 30-mph, and then the gas engine kicks in to provide extra acceleration support. Electric power can last for 22-miles without using a drop of gas. The transmission, or lack thereof is what makes the Regera not technically a hybrid, according to Koenigsegg. Instead of a traditional automatic or manual, or a belt-driven CVT converting power and supplying it to the wheels, the Regera uses a single-ratio transmission that saves weight over traditional hybrid systems and theoretically loses no power between the engine and the wheels. That means that the Regera reaches its 249-mph top speed upon hitting its 8,250-RPM redline. Bottom line: the Regera is hair-raisingly fast, and should set some record numbers when it reaches the roads within the next few years.

In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).\\", answer the following question.

Answer:","output":"The passage does not explicitly mention a specific individual who negotiated more favorable terms on behalf of the UK in the Destroyers For Bases Agreement.

Let's create a sentence in Spanish for this task: \\"El sol brilla en el cielo despejado y las flores comienzan a florecer en el jardín.\\" This sentence translates to \\"The sun shines in the clear sky and the flowers begin to bloom in the garden.\\" in English. Spanish, like many other languages across the world, relies on specific rules of syntax, grammar, and punctuation to convey different ideas, thoughts, and expressions. In this particular Spanish sentence, \\"El sol\\" (literally, \\"the sun\\") is the subject while \\"brilla\\" (English: \\"shines\\") is the verb. \\"En el cielo despejado\\" (English: \\"in the clear sky\\") and \\"y las flores comienzan a florecer en el jardín\\" (English: \\"and the flowers begin to bloom in the garden\\") are both prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials modifying the verb, providing more information about where and when the action is taking place. The sentence uses specific Spanish articles \\"el\\" and \\"las\\" to define the nouns \\"sol\\" and \\"flores\\". Spanish verbs are usually adjusted depending on the subject and the tense, like \\"brilla\\" for \\"it shines\\" and \\"comienzan\\" for \\"they start\\". This sentence is representative of basic Spanish language structure, but it's worth noting that Spanish, like all languages, has complex and varied forms, with many exceptions to its grammatical rules. The nuances of the language can change based on regions and countries, with different dialects, idioms, and slang present throughout the Spanish-speaking world."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: what grade are you at 6 years old?","output":"At 6 years old, you are usually in 1st grade.

Context: Understanding the context of the tweeter, such as their past posts, interests, or any ongoing discussions they may have been participating in, can help provide more insight into the sentiment behind the tweet. It is essential to know if the tweet is a part of a conversation or a standalone thought. 2. Language: The phrase \\"Before the Storm\\" suggests a moment of calm preceding an event or situation that could be metaphorically turbulent or challenging. The sentiment could convey anticipation, unease, or alertness depending on the context. The use of three dots or an ellipsis can imply a sense of suspense, leaving the interpretation open-ended and encouraging the reader to imagine what the \\"storm\\" could be. 3. Current events or pop culture: It is important to consider any ongoing events or pop culture references that the tweet may allude to. For example, \\"Before the Storm\\" might refer to an actual weather event, a political situation, a personal challenge, or even a popular book, game, or television show. Identifying any potential connection can provide valuable clues to understanding the sentiment of the tweet. Analyzing these aspects, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as follows: 1. If there is no specific context or reference to any event, the sentiment of the tweet could be seen as mysterious or foreboding, inviting the audience to speculate on the meaning behind the words. The use of the ellipsis adds to the air of mystery and suspense. 2. If the tweeter is referring to an actual storm, the sentiment could be interpreted as apprehensive or alert, indicating the calm moment before the arrival of a visually dramatic or potentially destructive event. 3. In the case of a metaphorical storm, the sentiment will depend on the context. For instance, if the tweeter is referring to an upcoming personal challenge such as a job interview or a competition, the sentiment could be seen as determined, resolute, and focused. Alternatively, if it is related to a global or political event that might result in conflict or upheaval, the sentiment might be apprehensive, concerned, or even fearful. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"Before the Storm...\\" could range from mysterious and suspenseful to apprehensive or concerned, depending on the specific context, language use, or reference to any current events or pop culture. By delving deeper into these aspects, one can better understand and describe the sentiment behind the tweet."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2.

Article: The best family vacation that I ever had was going on a road trip to Myrtle Beach. The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7 So while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g Question: What does the author mean by saying \\"we were at each other's throats\\"?A Answer: Choices: A).

But I can use this background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] What is an answer for this question: Which city had less child mortality? The answer to this question is:","output":"Y city had less child mortality compared to city X. This is because Y city's hospital had a good disposal site for biomedical waste, preventing ground water contamination and minimizing the spread of infectious diseases among the population.

If you are looking through the sighting apparatus of a gun, then it can be said that you have seen something through the \\"sights.\\" 2. Optical illusion - This term refers to a visual phenomenon where the brain misinterprets the information it receives from the eyes, resulting in a perception that does not match the physical reality. It doesn't directly relate to seeing something through an eyepiece. 3. Optical telescope - This is a type of telescope that uses lenses or mirrors to gather and focus light from observable objects in the sky. If you have viewed an astronomical object through an eyepiece attached to a telescope, then this is the most suitable option. 4.

The woman had a harder time quitting smoking than she did quitting drinking. Choices: I. smoking was an easier vice for her to crack. II. drinking was an easier vice for her to crack.","output":"II. Drinking was an easier vice for her to crack. The woman had always been an open book about her vices to her friends and family, including her struggles with alcohol and nicotine addiction. When she openly decided to quit this duality of addiction, everyone expected her to encounter hardship with both smoking and drinking, considering the strength of these vices. However, surprisingly, it was freeing herself from alcohol that proved to be easier comparatively. In her younger years, alcohol was often seen as a mechanism to escape the pressure of her job or occasionally, the mundanity of life. But as the years wore on, the woman began to realize, slowly and reluctantly, how alcohol was gradually corroding her life. It was not just a social lubricant anymore; she was drinking on her own and would more often than not, find herself under the influence of alcohol's intoxicating and stupefying effects. Even her sleep patterns started getting disrupted, and she was often left with debilitating hangovers and punctured memories. One such morning deep in the throes of discomfort, she took a hard look at her life and embarked on the journey to sobriety. She initially assumed that it would be a daunting task, as alcohol was so deeply ingrained in her routine. However, her commitment was strong, and she started seeking professional help. With guidance from therapists, and relentless support from her family and friends, she persevered through. While it was a struggle, with its share of ups, downs, and relapses, she managed to rid herself of the dependence on alcohol. She discovered healthy coping mechanisms, such as meditation and exercise, to deal with pressure and life's adversities instead of seeking solace in alcohol. This journey, albeit difficult, had a tangible positive impact on her health and relationships, inspiring her to move further on this path of redemption and quit smoking too. However, quitting smoking turned out to be an uphill battle like none other she had fought before. The woman found smoking to be more challenging because it was not just a physiological addiction to nicotine but also a psychological one, deeply intertwined with her daily routines and habits. She smoked during breaks at work, after meals, and the first thing in the morning. These habits were difficult to change and proved to be a significant obstacle to quitting completely. The withdrawal symptoms were a different beast altogether, causing her unbearable physical distress as well as intense mental and emotional turmoil. Despite professional help and support groups, quitting smoking was a painstakingly slow process, riddled with multiple relapses, each one hitting harder than the last. But one thing she had learned from her journey was never to lose hope and keep moving one step at a time. The road to quitting smoking was undoubtedly steeper, longer, and rockier than quitting drinking, proving that in her case, smoking was indeed the tougher vice to crack."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: An Italian prison official's wife is kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand that a notorious prisoner be released in order for the man to get his wife back.
